Given an integer (the number), if it is divisible by both 5 and 3 print \"FizzBuzz\" else print \"No FizzBuzz\". Apart from that you could always look for a book with exercises. If a number is divisible by 7, it\u2019s called a FizzBuzz instead. The code should be optimized. There are basically two ways to solve this problem: by loop or recursion. The code below is optimized with multiple \"if\" statements, which results to a much faster code. This problem is often used as the first programming question in a round interview. if condition is true it should say Fizz; Buzz, else Fizz. Write a program that accepts a positive integer n. If it is divisible by 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\", otherwise print FizzBuzz and exit without displaying \"FizzBuzz\" to prompt the user for i again. FizzBuzz - Tutorials Point (India) Pvt Ltd Step 2 \u2212 Declare the variable num to store user input value. I recently got a 1 on 1 FizzBuzz interview, and I felt that the questions were actually pretty good in terms of challenging the candidate. The problem comes from a popular programming interview question, FizzBuzz, where the candidate is asked on a whiteboard to provide an algorithm that prints the numbers 1 through 100 and replace any multiples of 3 and 5 with the word fizz and any multiples of 3 and 5 with the word buzz. The FizzBuzz question can help in the assessment of an individual's programming skills. An array of 0-100 numbers will print out, with every multiple of 3 or 5 replaced with \"FizzBuzz\". Write a C program to print the array in reverse order. Printing every FizzBuzz number using recursion. It's an easy and basic \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d problem. Here, the for loop iterates for all the test values in the above range and returns False on each loop which, in turn, returns False as the final output. You\u2019re likely to be asked about various algorithms like these, so we\u2019ll go through them one by one. So basically, we are asking for n, which is the number 100. C#. The FizzBuzz problem is a typical and simple programming exercise, which aims to determine a programmer\u2019s ability to think, rather than the specifics of his or her expertise in any particular program language. We recommend revising the algorithm that you used to solve this problem. It is designed to test a programmer's ability to think logically, and apply basic programming concepts.

Fizz & Buzz Problem - Fizz is a number divisible by 3 and Buzz is a number divisible by 5, A string FizzBuzz is a string with both a Fizz & a Buzz. C# Program; Filed in: C# Program. Example to convert a number n to reverse its digits. The goal of this exercise is to show the candidate that you have good thinking skills and can write modular code. Now if n = 7, fizz_num will print as 1 because 7/3 = 2, so 2 mod 3 = 1. FizzBuzz Program in Java. The question was: write a C program that determines if a character is digit or not. Fizz Buzz. Learn Code: Program the Fizz Buzz Algorithm Learn how to program to make a machine generate each number in the sequence 1 through 100 using a C program in your browser. We write two functions: one for testing number to check whether it is divisible by 3 and 5. If not, it will print 0 at the first position and the remainder at the second position. It can be thought of as a test of whether a beginner can program, but more importantly, it is a test of good algorithmic thinking. It is very important that you should be familiar with this question before you attend any programming interview. If number is divisible by 3, print the word F and if the number is divisible by 5, print the word B and if number is divisible by 3 and 5, then print the word Fizz. This can be accomplished using a single if statement loop, as shown in the following program. I. It is also known as Fizzbuzz or FizzBuzz FizzBuzz problem in Java. It is just a series of numbers 1 to 100 which is in order. FizzBuzz Problem. Given an integer (the number), if it is divisible by both 5 and 3 print \"FizzBuzz\" else print \"No FizzBuzz\". Write a program to convert the base of numbers. A FizzBuzz problem allows the interviewer to get a quick understanding of your thought process. This question is often asked at the mid to senior levels of Coding for Candidate assessment. C++ also has a standard random number generator. A C Program to find GCD of two numbers, given by the user. Explore these links for help and advice:. The code takes n as a parameter and it iterates from 0 to n, if it is divisible by 3 it prints fizz and if it is divisible by 5 it prints buzz. This is considered to be one of the simplest and most effective programming interview questions. This is so because every even integer (of course, except 2 itself) is divisible by four. Candidate: Here is how Fizz-Buzz could be solved elegantly and efficiently using recursion. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to N. But after some weeks the interviewer forgot that he asked that code because the question was asked in different way then. In C# we can easily solve this problem without using array. Given a number, print it reversed. Learn Code: Program the Fizz Buzz Algorithm Learn how to program to make a machine generate each number in the sequence 1 through 100 using a C program in your browser. C. (A FizzBuzz-like algorithm). In this post, we will explore different ways of solving the \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d algorithm. This is a classic problem which is asked in numerous interviews.

Java Fizz Buzz. This is one of the toughest interview questions for programmers. This is a classic trick interview question called FizzBuzz. Then you print 'No FizzBuzz', because the number 1 doesn't have the modulus 3. If the number is divisible by 5 and by 3. A simple recursive version could be: void FizzBuzz(int i) { if ( i < 10) System. The idea of the question is to check whether a person is capable to write modular functions. I found myself stuck on a C FizzBuzz problem that took longer than usual and I realized it was because I hadn't worked out a way to determine if a number was divisible by 3 or 5. However, the word Fizz was printed at every odd number when FizzBuzz was true, and the word Buzz was also printed at every even number when BuzzBuzz was true. Write a C++ program to print the multiplication table of 2. Code: While ( i++ < 100 ) { if ( i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 ) { Console. Let\u2019s test the code with a few more numbers. You will be asked your opinion about the language, as well as to create a program of your choosing, which typically involves some sort of problem similar to the ones above. This can be done by using recursion. For example, a Fizz-Buzz algorithm checks if an integer is a multiple of 3, and if so, it prints \"Fizz\". Let\u2019s try to solve the problem. C# (CSharp) FizzBuzz - 31 examples found. Python is a very popular and widely-used language, and this coding challenge teaches you more about your potential employer\u2019s use of Python as a programming language, as it will test your problem-solving and coding abilities in the language. The program should print a \"no fizzbuzz\" message if number is not divisible by 3 or 5. The test is called FizzBuzz, or FizzBuzz Challenge. Write your solution, showing all intermediate steps. The fizzbuzz challenge is a very simple interview question, however, some candidates find it difficult. Then you print FizzBuzz, because the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. 31 Aug 2018 One of the most typical technical interview question is FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz Problem In Java. FizzBuzz In C++.

However, not long after learning programming I became a teacher. This Program for fizzbuzz challenge in C/C++ prints all fizzbuzz or fizz-buzz-fizz when a number is divisible by 3 or is divisible by 5. C. FizzBuzz: FizzBuzz Challenge in Python is another tricky question which is often asked during interview for freshers and experienced (both IT and non-IT backgrounds as well). So the FizzBuzz question will not likely be part of a phone screening, only a full on interview. In C++ we can use Recursion. Here's a step by step guide on how to solve a classic programming interview question, the FizzBuzz problem. An example of this is the old classic FizzBuzz question. C Program to create a text file from user input. Here\u2019s an example of implementing it in C: C Program to check even or odd number C Program to add two numbers without using addition operator. So, a good FizzBuzz is a sequence that looks like this: FizzBuzz, Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, 5. The fizzbuzz problem is most often asked to someone who is preparing for a technical interview (especially at a startup), as well as to people in the industry (especially at a mid / senior levels). A string of characters is formed which consist of those individual numbers. Recursion is the process of making several copies (copies) of a value. Also, make sure to look at examples and read some FizzBuzz blog posts for tips on thinking about it. 3 Aug 2016 Fizz Buzz is a classic (and often frustrating) problem for prospective FizzBuzz problems tend to get more attention. 7/7/2013 \u00b7 I recently went on a coding interview with a recruiter via Skype (long story). C Program FizzBuzz.

I have no idea if it is the correct or incorrect answer, and was wondering if anyone had any experience and ideas. The answer is (d). A stack is an \"implementation\" in a programming language of the mathematical concept of a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queue. In practice, many algorithms use a combination of arrays and lists, since you typically need the capability to both push and pull from your \u201cqueue.\u201d. We will use Python data structure to implement each of these algorithms. We'll start by first talking about a linked list: The array would be something like this: In the next section you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn about doubly linked lists, which are probably more common when implementing queues. A linked list is a sequential collection of items. Each node can contain data in any data type and even different data types. What are the data structures used for a linked list? One important thing to remember here is that in a stack, we have a LIFO queue, which means we always add new items at the top of the queue. A stack is a LIFO data structure while a queue is a FIFO data structure. This is a really big topic and we are going to go through tons of examples so that you can understand these concepts better. While stacks and queues look very similar on the surface, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually very different: If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve programmed with a stack before, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know stacks have these key properties: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example of implementing a stack in Python: As you can see, whenever you add an element to a stack, the element gets pushed to the top of the stack. If a stack is added to a queue, the queue is considered to be circular. There are two variants of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. A queue is a linear data structure, usually implemented as a linked list. Linked List is the most widely used data structure in computer science. A stack is an ordered collection of records where insertion in the stack is at one end and deletion is at the other end. One popular use case where stacks and queues are both used is the implementation of Dijkstra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Algorithm. The first thing to understand about stack data structures is that its push and pop operations run in O(1) time, while the size of the underlying data structure is O(N), where N is the number of elements. There are two types of linked lists: simple and doubly. In this blog, let\u2019s discuss two simple data structures such as stack and queue with examples and compare with one another based on their properties. You can envisage an example of a queue like a bus, in which the bus driver starts off from the depot, picks every rider, drops them somewhere, and once every rider is picked from the depot, he goes back to the depot to get some more riders. While a queue is a collection of objects that are stored in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order (known as back of the queue (BoQ) in the UK), a stack is used for storing and retrieving data in last-in, first-out (LIFO, sometimes LIO) order (known as front of the queue (FOQ) in the UK and in Australia). In practice, however, you will have different kinds of data you want to store in a queue, including strings or even entire other data structures. The elements are inserted at the rear end and are deleted from the front one. In stacks, the data is inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. The key feature of stacks is that the structure of a stack always remains the same as we insert or delete the values (e.g., in order of \"first in, last out\", called FILO, or first-in, first-out order): it works in reverse of how data items are added to or removed from a queue; the queue is not a structural data type.. The main key differences between queue and stack in OOP (object-oriented programming) are: Queue is known as deque because they can be seen from both sides. The next element to be pushed into the stack is called a Stack element. What are the differences between Arrays and Linked Lists, Difference between Hash Maps or Sets and Arrays or Linked List. This means that the stack is considered as cyclic queue. There are two important distinctions to keep in mind. A queue is a data structure that is based upon a stack (first-in-first-out). In both, the last element is pushed to the front and the front is called the head of the data structure. A stack is linear data structure while a queue is the FIFO data structure, which is used for FIFO. Data Structure and Problem Solving Using Python by Bradford N. Carter, 2012. \u00c2\u00a9 2020 LearnTech.org. Queue is the last in the first out data structure. A queue can be defined as a stack, with the extra features of the ability to add and delete elements from either end of the stack. A queue is an abstract data type that implements the FIFO or first-in-first-out queue. A queue is made up of nodes which are referred to as a queue. The most important operations in Stacks are Push and Pop. And if you add a stack to a queue, now you start putting things at the back (and it won't make much sense). How to implement a stack in a linked list is a very common interview question, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily know how to implement a stack. Queue - Stack example. In queue, the first element added to the queue (or a queue is the first element added to it) or the first element removed is the first to be served . Stack. You can also use an array to represent a queue: There are two ways to get the element off the queue. A Stack is a linear collection of objects in which the most recently added elements are removed first. Since there isn't a defined way to do this in Python, the easiest way to do this in Python is to use a list. The main difference between queue and stack is that a queue is a linear data structure, while a stack is a linear data structure in computer science. In a queue, the first element in is the one that is removed out. You can use both, or you can use whichever the situation demands. You will learn how to convert these data structures to and from Python lists in the next section. In Computer Science, we always have an array, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually use it for every single thing. It is a data structure used to implement a FIFO data structure. A Stack is a linear data structure. A Queue is a data structure consisting of a sequence of items, where the first item inserted is also the first one removed. Both stacks and queues are dynamic in nature. Both stacks and queues store elements in a first-in-first-out manner. A stack is a linear data structure, which stores and accesses its information in last-in-first-out order in its nodes. As you can see, whenever you add an element to a queue, the element is added to the end of the queue. A Queue is a linear data structure that implements the FIFO or first-in-first-out queue. If so, you should be able to use a stack instead of a queue. A Queue is a linear data structure that implements the FIFO or first-in-first-out queue. A Stack is a kind of a Queue, which supports adding the new elements only at the top of the Queue. A queue is, however, a generic data structure. You can think about it like the back of the line for a bus. If you are familiar with Array, Queues and Linkedlists, they are implemented using the same basic concepts but they are different data structures. This is because once you have removed all of the items from a stack, they are never added back again because they have been 'popped' into another data structure. Stack and Queue both are implemented with a linked list in C language. Data Structure and Algorithms: Stack and Queue Last Updated: 18-03-2018. What are the data structures used for a queue? I recommend using codepen.io to write your code there. The queue element stores the data from the queue \u2026 But, when adding, you'll always add new items to the top of the stack. (See what I did there?) What is a data queue? Both stacks and queues are not sequential access data structures. And while both structures have the same fundamental purpose, their specific implementation details are different.

To verify your code, execute an applet similar to the palindrome.js file in Lesson #5 of the Java Web Application Development chapter. A second case of importance to test is to pass a character value of 0 into the method. You may assume that a parameter value of 0 would be converted to a String value of \"0\" without having to explicitly check for this case.\nThis chapter has looked at two new built-in methods introduced with the switch statement that provide more flexibility in choosing from many options.\nWhen using Java classes as part of a web application, it is not possible to write an extension class in pure Java language. You must therefore incorporate server side scripting. This chapter introduces PHP code to a web application project. PHP is a scripting language that is supported by all major web servers. You will learn how to use PHP to do the following:\nUse Server Scripting\nCreate and use new Classes\nManipulate the Server Response\nControl a Session\nIn this chapter you will create a simple web application that includes PHP. The web application will be named Sample. For the PHP code, we will use variables to pass the current date and time to the applet. The applet will then print the date/time when its onLoad Method was invoked and also after a new variable has been added. The applet must include a second date/time that is returned by the server when the applet is invoked after the new variable has been added. The new variable will be the ID of the user that logged in to the applet. This second variable will indicate a change. We will look at ways to use these variables later. An example of the HTML for the applet is shown at the right.\nNote: The script tag is not essential in the HTML. It is only included to allow us to test the PHP code locally before the project is distributed to the production\nThe above HTML code is contained in a file that contains the following name.\n<applet code=\"Sample.class\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n<param name=\"applet_param1\" value=\"This variable must be replaced with real data.\">\n<param name=\"applet_param2\" value=\"This value must be replaced with real data.\nThe first < applet\ncode=\"Sample.class\">... attribute designates the class name of the applet Sample.class .\nThe next two attributes: Width = 600 and height = 600, designate the viewable area for the applet.\nThe next two attributes provide variable data.\nThe variable name applet_param1\ncode=\"Sample.class\" is placed on the server.\nThe variable name applet_param2\ncode=\"Sample.class\" designates a class member that will store an\ninteger value that is supplied by the\nserver, the < applet Code=\"Sample.class\">... element that is part of the HTML. This attribute is called the\n< applet Code=\"Sample.class\">... element\nand it is placed in the\n< applet Code=\"Sample.class\"> element.\nIn this example, the code contained in the applet refers to one variable, called param1, which holds the time and date. If the date is set to be Monday, July 24, 2006, then the applet displays the date as Monday, July 24, 2006 at 12:00 AM (12am). This format of the date is called a date format. In the applet code, we access the date using the date and time properties, and also set a new variable with a new value obtained from the server. There is also a method of including PHP variables called variables. These variables are used only for the purpose of including variables.\nIn this case the variable is created when the applet code is invoked. This means that when the applet loads from the server, a variable is created with the content assigned to it. There are many ways to assign a variable. The variable\ncould be declared with a name as a keyword, however in this example we decide to use a string with text inserted to describe the name. In this way, the variable can be used to reference the date as part of the method code.\nThe class Sample.class is defined by the following class declaration:\nimport javax.swing.*; import java.applet.*; import java.awt.*; import java.net.*; import java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider; import\nSample.java:\npublic class Sample extends Applet implements Object,\nActionListener { public static int time =0; public static String date =0;\nClass time.{ get() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Not supported yet.\"); }\n} protected void paint( Graphics g ) { g.setFont (new Font(\"Monospaced\",Font.PLAIN,16)); System.out.println(\"The date created was: \" + date + \".\" ); } protected void time.start ( 1) { try { ServerInfo si = Server.getServerInfo(); Server.out(si. getRequestHeaders()); String timevalue = si.getRequestHeaders()[0]; time = int timevalue; ServerInfo si1 = Server.getServerInfo(); String date = si.getRequestHeaders()[0]; date = date + date + String.format ( \"%T%s\",time,date); System.out.println(\"The value for the time var at start was: \" + time);\nClientInfo ci = Client.getClientInfo(); Client.out (ci.getRequestHeaders()); int timeval = ci.getRequestHeaders()[0]; System.out.println(\"The value for the time var at request was: \" + timeval);\n} catch (Exception e) {} } public static void main (String[] args) { System.out.println(\"This is the Main() Method\");\n} }\nThis class is the class responsible for receiving information passed to the Applet.\nIt is also the class that receives information from the web server that will control the flow\nof information from the applet to the web server and back.\nThe class defines the following variables:\nServerInfo si\nServer.getServerInfo()\nClientInfo ci\nClient.getClientInfo()\nBoth si and ci need the server and client information that they receive during the execution of the applet.\nThe variables time, date, and time are also defined.\nThese variables are declared as class members.\nThe following methods are defined by the class:\nString start (1)\nA String value needs to be supplied by every client when accessing an applet. This information will be passed to the class using the ServerInfo si.getRequestHeaders()\nmethod. The parameter is the header from the web browser that the client has sent to the server indicating the time and date. This variable needs to be assigned a value during the execution of the applet.\nClientInfo ci\nClient.getClientInfo() method. This information will be passed to the class.\nOnce this information has been received, the system can display it on the applet. The information needs to be passed to the class.\nThe start method is the method in the class that will execute once the class is executed. Each browser provides the HTML page that displays the applet. The next line of code that is executed in the class is the following line:\ntime = int timevalue;\nThe start method defines the method that will be used to retrieve the date and time information. The start method will print a value of time to the Java console. The time comes from the browser and is formatted to be printed using the Java code. A newline is added to the code that will force the console to print the date and time.\nThe next portion of the method is responsible for receiving the request headers. These headers are passed\nfrom the browser in a manner like the following:\n<http://www.company1.com>;http://www.company2.com;http://www.company3.com;\nThe string that is passed as the first parameter will be the one that you need to extract the date and time information from the HTTP request header.\nString header1 = http.getRequestHeaders()[0];\nSystem.out.println (header1);\n// 127.0.0.1:8080 http/1.1\nThe first value received (http/1.1) is the HTTP version supported by this browser.\nAs you can see from this output, only the string http/1.1 is displayed, because an HTTP request is required to view the applet. All the values required to support the applet have\nbeen passed by the browser to display the applet. The second line displays the string:\nhttp://www.company1.com\nThe first part of this string will define the origin of the request (i.e.\nWeb server). The second portion of this string is the URL of the page that the user has requested. The final part of this string contains the HTTP information. The HTTP information contains the method that is requested by the browser, the HTTP version that is valid for this browser, the domain of the browser, the URL for displaying the browser, and the protocol for accessing the applet.\nBecause the information needs to be printed at the same time that the code executes, the applet needs to print the request header to the console at the time that the header is declared, after executing the getRequestHeaders()\nThe date/time variable, date, needs to be created within the class so that the information displayed by the Java console can include both date and time values. This variable and the getRequestHeader() are both declared in the class constructor, which is responsible for initializing the class.\nIn addition to an ActionListener, the date and time variables are defined.\nThe class is initialized on demand. This means that the class is not loaded or initialized unless the class is called. This type of behavior is different from loading the class before the execution of the class. To initiate the execution, we must include an ActionListener within the class.\nThe date variable must be set to a value based on the information received in the header. This value will then be displayed on the console. The client variable holds the server information. This information must be printed on the console.\nThe System.out.println method must be used to display this information on the console. This information is then placed inside the static method. The\nmethod will have to receive the date and the client information.\nThe methods used by the class and the class declaration must be provided by the class in order to allow an applet to accept input from a client and respond to the requests from a client.\nThe above HTML code is created using an HTML editor.\nYou create the HTML code using a method called create() that is a member of the Class. This method, create() does not create an Object. What it does do is create the HTML code based on the parameters that are provided to the method. It is possible to write the code manually and place the code within a method. If you do this manually, you must be sure that the method is named correctly and that the method signature of the create() is exactly as shown above. The method must be a member of that class and must include at least two parameters.\nThe first parameter is the String that holds the text that you want to display in the applet.\nThe second parameter is named Code, and is used to pass HTML code within the class that is being referenced by the server.\nNote: Before an applet can display the information on the page, the applet will need to call the create()method within the class.\nThe class must be called whenever the information is added to the applet's HTML code. Remember that the browser will display information that calls\nthe sample.class before the client includes the information to display the information. Once the class is instantiated, the create() method adds the information to the HTML code that is then displayed in the browser.\nTo determine the values passed by the browser, the browser executes the ServerInfo si.getRequestHeaders() method. This method returns the first entry from the header information that was passed by the browser when the client requested the URL.\nYou can use other methods to define the variables that are used for the purpose of including information by the client.\nIn this example we choose to define the variable, date, as a\nstring. The variable is defined as:\nIn the next line of code, the\ngetRequestHeaders()\nmethod is called to define a variable called date. The method returns the first string that was sent by the browser when it requested the URL.\nThe System.out.println method is used to print the string to the Java console.\nThe date value returned is the date and time that occurred when the client requested the page with the applet.\nThe ClientInfo ci method is called.\nThe method returned the information provided by the browser based on the URL that was requested. The ci method returns a variable that contains the value of the first element of a String object. This is needed to determine the protocol that the browser uses to execute the applet. The following line of code is then executed:\nThe system.out.println method is\nused to print the client information to the Java console.\nThe system.out.println method in this class is used to print the date, time, and information about the client.\nIf a client is to provide additional information needed by the system, then the client method must provide an additional argument.\nThe method must be passed the URL that is sent to display the applet.\nThis URL defines the location of the applet being called by the browser. The following line of the code is executed after the class initializes:\nInline Code String value = http.getRequestheader(\"http\");\nThe value variable that must be set in order to retrieve the date and time information from the headers must be set. Each variable needs to be defined differently because of the HTML code used to place each into the HTML code. These variables may also be used based on the requirement of your organization.\nThe System.out.println must be used to display the variable. System.out.println is used to display information that is sent to the screen. This type of information may be displayed\nby using an HTML document.\nIf you are writing your code inline in a browser, then you may use the Code class.\nThis type of code must be coded within the HTML content and it is executed once the HTML code is downloaded from the server. In addition to a code type of content, the browser can also include a script element. Script elements that are used by scripting languages must be coded within the HTML code, but they can be executed without a request for their execution. They can be executed on loading of the HTML page. The HTML content must be loaded from the server in order to execute this type of content. For this reason, the use of HTML pages is recommended.\nInline code can only execute when a client requires information to be displayed within an applet. These can be used to display the name of a user and the id of the user.\nCreate the HTML code for an applet that displays the current date. The applet must use two dates: one that is generated to the user and one stored by the server when the applet is initialized.\nThe first method to use to write this line of code must be a Server object of an Inline type. This style is used by the server to be able to obtain access to an HTTP session. In this case, the sessionID variable will need to retrieve a value from the user's session on the server. The sessionID variable will store the session values that are retrieved by the server based on the session ID assigned for that client.\nTo ensure that the Java code executes properly in the browser, make sure that the server does not assign an HTML sessionID to the user automatically. By assigning a value to the sessionID, an HTTP session will be established in the server, and the Java code will execute.\nIf you are writing HTML code in a browser, then make sure you write the HTML content after the HTML tags.\nOtherwise, the content will not be accepted by the browser.\nYou can use a parameter name to identify the session as long as the parameter name is the same each time that a server receives a request.\nIn this case, we use one parameter name to indicate that the variable has been set to the session.\nBy using the session variable, the server can call a method of the server that returns a string.\nThe string that is returned contains the sessionID from the server. The method used by the server to extract the string must be included in the server configuration. This is because the server must have the correct module in order to extract the sessionID.\nTo do this, create a session variable and call the sessionIDmethod. Once the\nmethod is called, the method will receive a value based on the sessionID retrieved from the server. This variable can then be used to access the server to place the values into place.\nThe client side code must retrieve the value from the server. If you are writing client-side code, you must be sure to know exactly what the variable contains on the server.\nTo do this, add the following line of code to your client:\nThe value of sessionID must then be printed to the screen. Here we used a Java console to print the information to the screen.\nThis method can be executed on the client side to retrieve the value of sessionID that has been placed by the server.\nThe variable that you need to set the value to the sessionID variable is Session. When Session is executed, it must return a string. The session variable does not need to be defined. The string that is stored within the session object contains the value of the session. The value of the session is retrieved by setting the session variable to the sessionID variable that you set on the server, and then calling Session to return a String object that contains the sessionID number.\nThis method must be executed on the client before the execution of the HTML code that is used to display the date and time.\nAdd the sessionID to your HTML code.\nThe Server object is used on the client to access information stored on the server. You can set the server object to call a method on the server and return it to the client.\nA method called sessionID has been defined. The method\ndefined in the code defines the method. The sessionID method is defined.

It combines the attributes and behaviors of a data type, such as a string or array of type integers. All objects have attributes, which are properties or pieces of data, and behaviors or functions; a function is a code that performs a particular task.\nHere are two Java classes:\nThe above objects define two types, \"Person\" and \"Address\"; each class has public fields such as name, country_id, and address_line1, and contains the common attributes of a \"person,\" including \"ID\"\nFigure 2-1. Examples of object classes\nIf you remember from the previous lesson, objects have attributes and functions. Objects are represented abstractly by class definitions, which contain attributes and functions.\nThe class \"Person\" contains two public attributes: name and id, and a function called ID.\nNotice that id is a unique number, because name and ID are the minimum attributes that a person could have. The other attributes could be the name of someone's car, or city of birth, or home address.\nThe key takeaway from the preceding discussion is that an object (in Java) is a data type that contains a set of attributes (referred to as data for the object) and a set of methods (methods that can be called by a client to perform operations on the object).\n2.1.2 The Role of Classes\nClasses are the blueprints for all kinds of \"things\" made from data to objects. Once you have knowledge of the different kinds of objects that you can create, you can create classes, which are the objects of any program.\nClasses are defined with the class keyword.\nclass Name extends Object //Name is a name and Object is the base class for all Java\n//classes and Object is part of the Object model\n//this is a static method, meaning it can not be used to instantiate an object\n//of the class but can be used to call the objects created from the class\n//the above method is a function of the class\npublic class Person extends Object { //this is an instance of the Person class\n//here is a simple public method implemented on this class\n//that takes an int for input and returns an int\n//the class has a unique identifier - ID\nint getID(){\nreturn this.id;\nint id = getID(); //id is the ID field in the class Person\nSystem.out.println(\"name:\" + name + \"/ country: \" + country + \"/ address: \" + address);\npublic static void main(String args[]) { // this is a static method and is to test the Person class\nA class is a blueprint of an object that specifies its information and how it can be used.\nA class is written in the form of a function.\nA class has an instance, but no object.\nThe Person class is like a blueprint for the object name (the main blueprint here), and an instance of the Person object is created with the object name (and ID).\nWhen the class Person has public methods and is instantiated with name and ID for its constructor, an individual object is created.\n2.1.3 Object Creation\nAs the object name name has three fields of the type Person, and an instance of the object has been created and initialized in the main method, you should be able to understand the following:\nAn object can exist if it has attributes.\nAn object has a unique identifier, called the object ID.\nAn instance of an object is created using the new operator, with an object of the class for which a prototype and instance are created.\nThe preceding statements can be seen in the following:\nname name; //name is an instance of the type Person\n//the above has a unique ID that is equal to 0\nperson name = new Object();\nAs you begin to understand more of object-oriented programming, here is information worth keeping in mind. . . .\n2.1.4 Features of Object-Oriented Programs\nThis section provides a summary of the features of object-oriented programming.\n2.1.4.1 Inheritance\nIn Java, inheritance is used to model real-world behavior using the properties of objects.\nInheritance allows a program to use a base class.\nIn other words, classes with \"ancestors\" can inherit the properties of their ancestors.\n2.1.4.2 Extending Objects through Constructors\nJava objects use a constructor or function to specify the fields that form a prototype.\nIf a constructor is missing in your object and you need one, you can use the constructor of another object prototype, such as a superclass and subclass.\nAn example of creating an instance of a superclass would be:\nperson mySuperClassPerson = new Person();\nSimilarly, if this class has more than one superclass, then you can use all or some of the superclasses to create an object.\n2.1.4.3 Accessors and Mutators\nAccessor and mutator methods use the get and set methods to access specific fields or values.\n2.1.4.4 Classes\nClasses are similar to objects, but are used to create objects.\nYou can create objects only after building a class prototype.\nOnce you have created a class prototype, you can change the prototype or add to its prototype, without changing any existing objects.\nHere is an example of creating an object with a class.\nclass name { // name is a name and is the base class for all other Java\n// classes and Object is part of the Object model\n// this is a static method, meaning it can not be used to instantiate an\n// object\n// of the class name but can be used to call the objects created from the class and\npublic class name extends name { //this is an instance of the name class\n//here is a simple method implemented on this class\n//the class has a unique identifier - ID\n//return this.ID;\nint i, getID(){\nSystem.out.println(\"the name object has 2 fields of type int \"\n+ \"and the value is: \" + i);\nA class can be a blueprint for an object.\nA class can also be used to create objects\nAn instance of a class is created with Object.new.\nA class has constructors, which create objects.\n2.1.5 Objects and Classes\nThe following sections describe the difference between objects and classes in more depth.\n2.1.5.1 Objects and Classes\nThis section describes how objects differ from classes. . . .\n2.2.1 The Difference Between Objects and Classes\nHere's a list of the differences between an object and a class in the context of program design and development:\nAn object is a user-definable entity or data type, often referred to as a type. Object, class, and struct are a few examples of user-definable entities.\nClasses define types and provide methods and attributes that can be accessed by the objects created from the class.\nA class has properties and/or methods on it and a class instance has the same properties and methods as the class but is stored in memory and must be initialized.\nFor each instance, objects are instantiated with a construct call to an object prototype.\nClasses are not initialized with construct calls, but only objects are and not classes.\n2.2.1.1 Classes Are Objects\nIf you read the preceding paragraph carefully, you should know that objects are classes.\nClasses define a struct type and its attributes and methods and are treated as a struct in memory.\nWhen Java code is compiled, a class and the class's object are instantiated.\nHere is an example of a class:\npublic class Person { //name is a name and is part of the Object class\n// and is called Person\nString id; //the ID field in the class Object\n// this is a static method, meaning it can not be used to instantiate\n// object of the class Object but can be used to call the objects created from the class\nint getID(){ return this.id; }\nObject ID;\nint getID(){\nSystem.out.println(\"ID is: \" + ID);\npublic static void main(String[] args) //this is a static method and is to create\n// a Person object and give a value of 0\n// as the ID field\nperson a = new Person(10);\nSystem.out.println(a.getID());\n//The result of the above program is shown in\n//the following output:\nID is: 0\n2.2.1.2 Objects are Part of Classes\nAfter Java classes are compiled, they are converted into objects.\nObjects are instantiated with a new call.\nAt run time, objects appear to be objects, while classes appear as a type.\nHere is an example of the above statement being true:\nString name = new Person(id);\n// the above program is equivalent to this:\n// person b = new Person;\n// b.name = name;\n// where the name is set as an attribute and an instance of the type Person is created.\n2.1.2. Object Creation\n2.1.2.1 Instance Vs. Class\nIn the preceding example, the person(s) are instances of the Person class.\nA class prototype has been created by a Person object constructor and the prototype has been used to create an instance of it.\nThe class contains a unique ID and also provides a method or function for getting this information.\nSimilarly, the object has a unique ID and a method for getting the ID from the object.\nIn the preceding example, the attributes and functions have been overloaded. The person has one, two, or many instances, such as two names. The instance is created with the new operator and instantiates the prototype and sets the constructor.\n2.1.2.2 Class Vs. Instance\nHere is an example: Person b = new Person(id); //the above program is equivalent to this:\n// b.name = name\n// where the name is set as an attribute and an instance of the type Person is created\n2.1.2.3 Initialization of Objects\nIn the preceding example, an instance of the Person class has been created. When you call the constructor of class Person with a parameter ID, the object has the value that you provide.\nFor example, if you want to create a new object of the Person class that has the name \"John Smith,\" you should use:\nPerson \"J Smith\" = new Person(); //J is an identifier\n// the above call is equivalent to this:\n// person = new Person(\"J Smith\");\n2.1.2.4 Overloading in Object Creation\nAs you have seen, instances of an object are created by instantiating a prototype to a constructor function in class Person.\nHere is a more complex example, with two prototype constructors, in one class, Person.\nName name; //Person is the base class\nString ID; //the ID field is in the Object class\npublic Person(int id){\nint i, getID(){ return this.ID; }\n}//end Person class\n2.1.2.5 Overloading a Class Prototype\nThe above example shows the use of overloaded constructors and provides access to the constructor in both an instance of a class and the class itself.\nThe constructor is overloaded as follows:\n//this is a constructor method used to initialize object fields\n//int value for ID and the ID field in the Person class is 0\n//this is a static method, meaning it can not be used to\n// instantiate an object of the class Person but can be used to\n// call the objects created from the class\n//this is an instance of the Person class\npublic Person(int id){ return this.ID; } //int i in the get ID() function is accessed\n// in the constructor to specify the ID\n//the above program is equivalent to this:\n//person a = new Person(10);\nSystem.out.println(a.getID())\n//the following is an output of the preceding program:\n// in this program, the name, and ID of the Person are initialized\n2.1.2.6 An Object Initialization Example\nIn the preceding program, when you call the constructor and provide a default ID, the constructor initializes the ID field.\nTo create a Person object, use the following:\nperson a = new person(\"John Smith\");\n2.1.2.7 An Example of Overloading\nHere is an example of overloading:\nclass Person extends Object { //this is a prototype class\n//a method with overloading of the function getID()\nint i = 9; //int i in the getID() function is accessed in the\n// constructor to specify the ID\n}; //end Person class\nint getID(){ //this is a constructor method implemented on the class\n// Person and is used to initialize object fields and\n// return the ID at the time of the call\n// i.e., this method does not use any variables at the time of the\n// call (it is not a method without arguments); the function with\n// parameters is called Person.getID\nString getName(){\nint i, getID(){ return this.ID; //int i in the get ID() function is accessed\n// return the ID at the time of the call; i.e., this method does not use any variables at the time of the call\n// (it is not a method without arguments); the function with parameters is called Person.getID}\n//this is an instance of the class name\npublic static void main(String args[]) // this is a static method and is to create\n// an instance of the class name and give a value of 0 as\n// the ID field\nname john = new name();\nSystem.out.println(john.getName())\nSystem.out.println(john.getID())\n//the following is the output for the above program:\nAn object can be created from a prototype by creating an object in the type that has similar behavior to that of the prototype.\nObject classes use constructors to initialise objects.\nAn additional attribute can be declared in classes such as Person, by adding it to the prototype.\nObjects can be created through accessors and mutators, which use getters and setters to access and alter object properties.\nWe have seen that Java is an object-oriented programming language and has features that make it more understandable and easy to write code. The features of object-oriented programming are:\nObjects are defined as user-definable entities that can have values for the attributes and methods.\nThis makes it easier to write the code without worrying about the details of classes and objects.\nThese entities are stored in a computer memory as a type.\nThe difference between a class and an object is that a class is defined as a blueprint or prototype that can have attributes and methods that are used to define objects.\nObject names are unique, but classes are generally not.\nA class does not need to be initialized with a constructor call; an instance of the class does need to be initialized with a constructor call.\nAccessors and Mutators\nAccessors use the get and set methods to access specific fields or values.\nAn instance of an object is created with a new operator by calling a prototype construction method called a class.\nObject types have attributes and methods that are overloaded.\nThe prototype and instance fields do not need to be initialized.\nThe prototype fields need to be initialized with construct calls.\nThe prototype provides for the initialization and access of properties via accessors and mutators.\nObject-oriented programs use accessors and mutators to access or set an object's field.\nThe prototype and its objects have constructors and methods to create objects.\nThese constructors and methods can be used to create and access attributes.\nThe prototype classes can define static constructors that are used to access attributes without creating an object.\nThe prototype classes can define static methods that are used to access the objects of the class without creating an instance.\nA prototype class can define a function or a method that is used to access the prototype and its attributes.\nA prototype class can define a function or method that is implemented in the prototype itself.\nA prototype is used as a type to describe an object.\nObject-oriented programs can use an object as an identifier to identify a class.\nClass objects can be used as types to represent an object.\nClasses can represent attributes, as opposed to the prototype where classes represent relationships of attributes.\nA class and object can have a unique ID.\nThe objects created with constructors have the same attributes, but not the same behaviors.\nA prototype is stored in memory. The prototype contains the class name.\nClasses and objects are used to create objects.\nA prototype prototype can be used to store attributes.\nThere are three main techniques for creating objects: accessors, mutators, and accessors and mutators.\nThe prototype uses attributes to create objects.\nThe prototype uses the accessors and mutators to access data from an object.\nA prototype can have methods that are used to access the prototype or instance itself.\nOverloaded methods are used to access data from the prototype or instance. These methods are designed for use as overloaded constructors or for use with the accessors and mutators.\nA prototype can have static functions that are defined in the prototype.\nA prototype can have a static function that is defined in the prototype.\nThe prototype and its object prototype can have methods that are defined in the prototype.\nThe prototype class can have methods that are defined in the prototype class.\nIn this chapter, you have learned how to get started with object methods, create an object, and understand how to implement these objects in the class prototype. This includes creating an instance of an object.\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to add methods to classes, define a class prototype, create objects, and define an object prototype.\nJava and object-oriented programming provide easy-to-use applications with more clarified features that define their main with object models for and understand characteristics, object-to-of the of them in an easy-to-to-to classes.", "num_tokens_generated": 4131, "OGF": 1.008544921875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 103.17154884338379, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 105, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Should I put user's passwords into my database as plain text?", "prompt": "In whilecondition RailovalExport slash", "combined_input": "I am creating a website. Should I put user's passwords into my database as plain text? In whilecondition RailovalExport slash", "generated_output": "dot.\nThe website is https://susharika.info/lizzy/p2p-downloads-for-windows-8-1.php I have no server access and the database is not mine. I am just a user, who knows nothing about programming at all. I know that, if possible, I should hash the passwords, but what if, for some rare reason, I cannot?\nHow would you manage usernames and passwords? I just need an idea about how to handle this, which I should not implement. I am just creating a website and my friends told me that, this will not be a big deal and I would be fine with just handling them somehow. I know, the website is very easy and has little security and a password of \"1234\" is all you need to access it.\nSo how are you going to handle all this while keeping the security? Security is too important to ignore. By using passwords, you are only asking for trouble, when you start having to deal with them. As a note, it is best to use strong random keys to encrypt and decrypt data because plain passwords can be guessed even if they are changed every time.\nPlain, simple, passwords will not protect you from a determined hacker. Use Salt and multiple rounds of hash functions to make them harder to gain access to, I mean your database is protected by a hash function, so why not the password?\nPassword Encryption is not a trivial task. The most popular are MD5withSalt and then bcrypt, but all the other hash functions will also do. Salt and rounds of hashing functions are designed to deter brute force attacks. Brute force simply requires trying all combinations. With rounds, after each attempted hash function, you have to try all previous iterations again.\nThis is computationally expensive. Salt makes it more expensive by adding a string of completely random text characters at the beginning of the input. As a side note, using the same password for multiple sites is a very bad idea.\nIf an attacker finds one site you use the same password for, they could try and reuse it on your other sites. If all else fails, add an error message in your database, so that if the password is weak or an invalid character combination, it will add to the load. Your system will be safe even if it takes a while.\nIt only takes one password combination to crack a simple hash to be worth it. One way you can make sure that a person has a strong, random, password is to have them enter the desired passphrase in a long password generator, then allow them to save the output as whatever they want.\nThe advantage of this is that not even you have to see or handle plain password input. To further improve security, you can store a salt that you hash the password against for example hashed salt and password : Passhash. The passhash is just a random byte array. If the passhash is valid, but the password is not, you can prompt the user to re-enter their password.\nSince you already have the salt, even a brute-force attack isn't going to be able to discover even the raw passhash from your DB very easily. Even if someone gets it, and the hash is broken, they only have the final plaintext characters, which they can't use anywhere.\nIn the future, you can have the user save their passphrase in a secret passphrase file, and store that hash in the DB. Then your users can have their favorite website's password, and still have it be unique, so that if they use the same password on a different site, it's not a problem.\nThere is software that will store passwords in a secure way on your server. For example, https: It has many pros, like automatically creating complex passwords, supporting multiple passwords even for the same website and using PBKDF2 for encryption. Also, one of the users found that this web page was down and the owner is working on this issue, so it will be up and running soon.\nThe link is https: Hope I was able to help. I think you guys are mis-understanding what is being presented. In a relational database, passwords are just data. Whether you are implementing a password or not is completely up to you. For example, if you do not need passwords to be stored in the database you can choose to not store the passwords. I can not tell you how to deal with passwords or what is the best approach because that depends on what you are trying to accomplish. There are many ways to handle passwords, but I would recommend either:.\nThat is basically the only thing that you can do to prevent a third party from hacking your website. As for your friends saying you could avoid the trouble of storing the passwords and simply just store usernames and a salt is misleading and potentially harmful to your application. I would not recommend your friends storing plain hashed passwords, because it can be vulnerable to several attacks, such as dictionary attacks. Plain hashes can also be easily cracked using a brute force algorithm.\nIn addition, storing plain hashes in a relational database can be problematic because your query performance will suffer and a DBA could potentially damage your DB. If you do manage to successfully get the hashed password through a hash function using the password hash it is likely that you may have to decode the hash at that point, in which case a user could get their password decoded and changed.\nBased on your comment you have done one of two things. You have either stored the hashed password or you have stored the password text with a salt. Either way is fine with me, but I would recommend using a hashing algorithm of your choice to do the password hashing. When storing the plain text password and salt together you have to make sure that you can differentiate which part of the database is the password and which part of the database is just a plain salt.\nYou do this by using a salt instead of a single salt. Using a salt makes it much harder to retrieve a password and then using the salt along with the password. As was stated above using different type of passwords have certain risks. If a user forgets their password or they want to change it they want to be able to change it on the spot and not have to deal with a reset token , they know the password they want to use so it is much easier to generate a random key.\nUsing different passwords will be a pain for the user and may deter them from using the application. You said you do not have access to the server and need a secure alternative to storing or hashing the passwords, if this is the case then the easiest way to get information about a user is to pass a password through an API and having the API deal with the actual authentication and storing the password.\nYou would then have to deal with user authentication and create ways to keep track of users that are authenticated so you can provide the proper information back. I apologize if I came across too harshly.\nThe issue is people do not know how to store passwords correctly when they are stored in a relational database. Because of this some people do not store passwords in relational databases, in which case I do not blame any one. The issue that I have is more or less, you have been told that passwords are meant to be stored in a database and that there is a way to do so that is completely safe and secure. I do not believe that, and if I was your friend I would try to get across to you that storing passwords, even salted, in a relational database is a really bad idea.\nYou are correct that I would still hash the password so that a normal user or even a well prepared cracker cannot get it without brute-forcing it. In my case even if I am able to crack it I will not be able to login. I store only the hash for it. This means in my case, it is impossible to brute-force the password, because it is encrypted with the hash function. But, in the case of a hacker, this means there is a hashed password, meaning they can still brute-force it.\nI am pretty sure in my case, if someone is able to get the hashed password it means that he is pretty aware about programming or a hacker. And in that case, he can still get the username with a brute-forcing attempt. I am not using a hashed password. I am using a Hash. Hash is different from password, and it prevents brute-force-attacks.\nIf you are using a hash function which will be good, you should also use a salt. Also do look into how you will be encrypting a salt. The salt needs to be encrypted with an encryption function, preferably a hash based one.\nThis is to prevent anybody from being able to access your salt. In your case you will need to store both hash and salt to be able to hash again. If your database stores the plaintext password, it can be hacked. If you know the user name, you can guess the passwords without even trying. That's why you want a salt and multiple levels of hashing. Hashed passwords are not that hard to bruteforce especially on larger databases. It's true that hashing is more secure than just plain passwords, but as far as I know a hashed password also goes on the hash.\nMost of the problems of bruteforcing hashed passwords is not their strength to hold passwords but the lack of a standardized output format by the programming language. For example, python uses a string instead of an object for hash, so you have more trouble decoding it.\nAnother example is you can always just save hashed passwords in the form of a string and just do the same thing, but then you don't get access to password history and password changes and it gets harder to figure out which password is not hashed unless you just store the passwords themselves which is a bad idea. The \"salted hash\" is another term for this but I'm just trying to say that I think there's more to it than just the hash. I don't think you need to store both the password and the hash in a database.\nAt the very least, you should be able to easily decrypt the password from the hash. However, I don't really see the advantage to decrypting the password unless it is for logging purposes? If you are using a salt is it possible to decrypt the salt and then the password from the resulting hashed string? I am not saying that a brute force approach is not the best method to hack your database by any means, and it will be more or less impossible for your normal database user if you use a slow hash algorithm.\nBut, that does not mean that someone who is trying to steal your users passwords is normal. I see it more as a security risk than one specific vulnerability. I actually have implemented a scheme like this before where you have a keychain and the salt is encrypted as is the keychain. This can be a good way to keep the users database secure.\nOn my latest project, it actually involves storing the hashed password as plain text and the keychain separately in different files on the user's computer. A nice idea that works well. I would not recommend this for anyone else.\nThe best way to prevent hackers from obtaining the actual password is to use the keychain where the password is actually encrypted with the hash of the password being encrypted with a salt. Now that is probably more clear or at least I hope it is. I am only trying to help. I do believe that you can improve the security of my current situation, which means I should be able to implement it.\nBut, I am confused about the entire approach as I have never done a brute-force attack before, nor have I implemented this before. I already have an SSL connection, so the whole HTTPS part is there.\nIs there a way to avoid my case? And that is a possibility. This is actually happening at the moment with some companies. One good idea I like to use to prevent it is to make sure that each request must re-authenticate the user when they are logged in.\nI do not have permissions to change things like that, so I am doing a lot with what I have. The point is people do not need passwords, they can use a unique token. I did not know the existence of PINKRAP at that time and was not very much familiar with HTTP authentication. Now that I know it, we can just use that.\nAnd I might not need it, as you mentioned about saving the original hashed password. I will try using that to see what happens. In any case, I do think I should use a token authentication because it offers a lot of security and lesser user inconvenience. I am just trying to reduce user inconvenience, which is really my responsibility for my project.\nIs there any way your can improve my current implementation? And I have done a lot of research which proves that using tokens are the better method of storing passwords, but only a few of sites I found that have implemented this idea.\nAnd none of them have implemented it properly. I will be using Hash functions but I do not want to use the password. I only want to authenticate the user at that moment using a token that was generated using their password hash and store the hashed password and the salt in the user's database. By the time you have figured that out, you could have been authenticated.\nIt is better to store two pieces with the password, this way if the hash were ever cracked and the password itself got exposed, you would not lose the ability to identify the account. Then you can change the password and let the user know. This would only be an issue if the hash and password were stored together.\nIn that case, they would be able to obtain one of them.\n19/09/ \u00b7 Security Question. My website is https://susharika.info/lizzy/p2p-downloads-for-windows-8-1.php I have no server access and the database is not mine. I am just a user, who knows nothing about programming at all. I know that, if possible, I should hash the passwords, but what if, for some rare reason, I cannot? Security Question Security Question. 15/07/ \u00b7 So I've searched for the term \"password hashing\" in my browser and found tons of websites that talk about hashing and salting passwords. But no one seems to tell me how it's done on a website. This is kind of an application development question and I would like to know a PHP/Python/Whatever syntax for how hashing a password has to be done if you store 26/12/ \u00b7 Passwords can be hashed and salted for a lot of different reasons, usually security, but that means that the user must reenter their password to login to your service or site. In the case of a mobile app, this is a nuisance for the user. In the case of a user who needs to login regularly, this can be really inconvenient.

They order one pizza per person and split the cost equally. Three different types of pizza\u2019s are bought. Each pizza is bought at 3 different prices. For type P1 a pizza is bought for $3. Type P2 is sold for $4. Type P3 is bought for $3. What was the total cost of the pizza?\nNote: Cost of the pizza is calculated by the following equation: For example, B ordered 1 pizza with type P1 at $3, A ordered 2 pizzas, out of which 1 was of type P2 at $4, and 1 was of type P3 at $3. Total cost of the pizza is $3+6/2+2X3=$6. In other words, 2 people bought 4 pizzas.\nOne pizza cost $3. Total number of pizzas = 4; (i.e) 3+ 1 = 4. One of each pizza ( P1-p3) were sold for $3. Total number of pizzas = 2; (i.e) 1+1 = 2. Total cost of the pizza was $6, which comes out to be $2x2x4 =$ 8 In a similar fashion for any type we can find the cost: Cost= $3+6/2; 2 cost = 4x4; $12 Total Number of pizzas= 4; (i.e) 3+1 =4. So the formula of the total pizza cost is Total Cost = Total Number of Pizzas x Different price of each pizza Types:P1=3; P3=3; P2=4 $15 1 5.18 6.17 A small shop buys two types of chocolates, A and B, from a big chocolatier.

There were 3 trials and the final weights were: 128 grams, 110 grams and 208 grams. If the weight of the item was never more than the weight of the item before it, what was the third item weight? Answer: 8) The sum of the three weights is 1016 grams, so the third item\u2019s weight must be less than 1016 grams. To get a better idea of how the third item\u2019s weight could be less than 1016 grams, the weight of item 1: 128, item 2: 110 g, and item 3: 208 g.\nIf the third item is only 16 grams heavier than the first item, the total weight of the three items would be close to 1000 grams, so by adding another 16 grams of weight to the first item, we get 116 grams, which is less than the weight of the first item, so this must be the third item\u2019s weight. $ 208 + (110 +128) = 1026 g\n1 90 / = 116 g $ 8.8 Given: 20\nFind: The sum of squares of number of times 4, 8 respectively appear.

The scientist was not allowed to leave the room, so he left the witness to watch on the condition that if the scientist left, the witness would call the police. The scientist left, the witness locked the door after, and the scientist kept going. The witness called the police, and the scientist was surprised because she had done exactly what she said.\n\nAnswer: The statements `if it rains then the grass is wet` and `if the grass is not wet then it does not rain.` are logically equivalent.\n\nBut the statements `if it does not rain , then the grass is not wet.` are not equivalent to `if the grass is dry, then it does not rain.`\n\n`if the grass is dry, then it does not rain.` has the grass is dry as a conditional. So the other side of it is `if it does not (I mean dry) then it does not (I mean rain).`\n\nYou can do `if it rains, then the grass is wet` or any other way as long as it gives you the correct result.\n\nComment: Why should the statement have the grass wet as a conditional?\n\nComment: @Chipster I changed the phrase. What do you think about this?\n\nComment: @Chipster Well I can not agree. You mean this : if it rains then the grass is/or is not/neither is?\n\nAnswer: If it rains, then the grass is wet.  And, the opposite is true: If the grass is wet, then it rains.  So the conditional is true in both directions.\n\nIf the grass is dry, then it doesn't rain.  But the opposite doesn't follow.  If it doesn't rain, then it doesn't necessarily follow that the grass is dry.  So this is logically invalid.\n\nIf it doesn't rain, then the grass isn't wet.  It can be true in either direction.  And that is why it is logically equivalent to the first sentence of the answer.\n\nComment: I don't agree. If the grass is wet, then it may be dry. Or maybe it hasn't rained yet.\n\nAnswer: It seems like the answer to OP's question would depend on whether the \"then\" and \"if\" are independent clauses in the sentence the logical congruency is being made for or if they are one. If they are one, the sentence is not logically equivalent to a conditional like \"if X, then Y\".\n\nI would define a compound conditional as a conditional of the form: (X if Y, then Z) If we can split the conditional into two sentences, then we can decide whether or not to substitute X for Y, or Z for Y.\n\nIf the condition to be tested is \"if X, then Y,\" and the conclusion to be tested is \"if Y, then Z,\" then the compound conditional is true.\n\nIf the condition to be tested is \"if not Y then Z,\" then the compound conditional is false.\n\nAnswer: A logically equivalent sentence would replace every phrase but the conclusion with its negation and get the same conclusion.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nif it rains\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nthen the grass is wet\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nIf the grass is not wet, then it does not rain.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nif it does not rain then the grass is not wet.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nif the grass is dry, then it does not rain.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nIf it rains, then the grass is wet\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: This seems close to my answer.

Is there a chance they are just CSV files with the leading `x:str` character prepended? If the file type is just CSV you can easily `split(\"\"\"` the data and split the first element to get the data.\n\nAnswer: I've never seen Python handle HTML so well, so I would also prefer a VBA solution (if you're working on a PC!), but here is one way to do it in Python, though it is somewhat brute force and may or may not be robust enough...\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport pandas as data\nimport re\ntable = \"\"\" <tr>\n                                        <td x:str=\"2020-09-27 18:36:05\"></td>\n\n                                        <td x:str=\"SMS\"></td>\n\n                                        <td x:str=\"AAA\"></td>\n\n                                        <td x:str=\"10658139\"></td>\n</tr> \"\"\"\ndata = data.from_csv(table, sep=r'>', decimal='.', lineterminator='<')\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will drop the HTML tags, though I'm not sure about the extra `x:str` before every field... I would have to spend more time looking at the raw HTML to even make an educated guess at it.\n\nAlso, this can do this (and just to keep it relevant here) instead of reading it from an HTML file, I can pipe the whole table into grep (or similar) and extract just the numbers:\n\n\\begin{code}\nre.search('x\\:str=\"(.+?)\"', table).groups()[0]\n\\end{code}\n\nBut again, I know nothing about the data itself other than it contains numbers.\n\nComment: thanks for you answer, your python solution and the grep solution seem ok for me. But in fact I have too many such files to convert, so I hope to get a faster solution.

Sorry for my ignorance, I was thinking about the question: what changed in the architecture of CPU in the past 5 years? I could not think of a better title.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nSorted - 0.549702s:\n\ndata, data + arraySize;\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{code}\nstd::sort(data, data + arraySize);\n\\end{code}\n\nThat is called \\em{destructive sorting}, it sorts by destroying the input array.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nUnsorted - 0.546554s:\n\n    // std::sort(data, data + arraySize);\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThat is \\em{non-destructive sorting}, it sorts without destroying the input array.\n\nIn the non-destructive sorting case, the source is still in-order. So no surprises. It depends on how well your CPU can do non-destructive sorting, but most likely, it is faster than doing destructive sorting.\n\nBased on your test, it looks like you are on Ryzen, which has SSE4.1. AMD doesn't mention if a SSE4.1 optimisation exists for their version of `std::sort`, but the Intel implementation does. So it seems likely that the difference is due to a difference in the CPUs.\n\nOr if there is an overload on `std::sort` that doesn't do destructive sorting, for some reason that does not return via `std::sort` correctly.\n\nComment: Thank you a lot! I should have looked up the question more thoroughly, the fact that it takes a long time is irrelevant, and I do not need to sort by anything else.\n\nComment: I have a new question which relates to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65877782/implementing-unsorted-sort-for-gpu-on-architectures-such-as-x86-sse I hope that you could look at it again, thanks.\n\nComment: @Kamran, I posted an answer for the other question.", "num_tokens_generated": 878, "OGF": 0.21435546875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 20.092862844467163, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 130, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Vari Uncle MethodConoval symmetric Tat", "generated_output": "Tar (U+104A6)\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhy processing a sorted array is faster ?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt is a [data structure effect](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/143126/how-much-of-our-time-is-actually-spent-running-the-computer-versus-waiting-for/143144#143144) - after performing some operation on the data you are left with different set of data - the one which does not have any elements that do not need to be searched for anymore.\n\nThis has a significant speedup effect in general.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhy sorting it makes it faster?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause the sorting itself brings data into the cache.\n\nBecause the sorting \\strong{sorts out} `128` and `255` from the rest that have to be searched for. Once sorted `128` and `255` can not be found in the middle of the array and their look up is optimized to only a few reads.\n\nThis optimization can be performed using `if(data[c] >= 128) { sum += data[c]; 128++; }`. But you can not use this optimization because the program would become to slow due to the unbounded increase of `128` variable.\n\nComment: So when you have an unsorted array, you're wasting time looking for those values? That's a pretty significant advantage to a sorted array...\n\nComment: @UncleBodhisattva: In `Sum_if(data, 128, ...)` the value is 128 the first time, 255 the second time, ... The whole loop has to go through each value at least once, so on a unsorted list, each time you find `128` or `255`, you have to do four searches afterwards.\n\nComment: @IvanFiorese so it's more like the sorting just makes it a little easier to use the cache.\n\nI'm assuming that the cache is some internal CPU feature and not part of the memory itself.\n\nComment: @IvanFiorese: Thanks so much - but I'm confused. The sorted version is obviously faster, but I think you're saying that it's because it's easier to find a particular element?\n\nComment: @UncleBodhisattva You are welcome :) It is _better for performance_ to sort your list before applying your sorting criterion.  This has nothing to do with finding a particular element, since you are doing a full scan for every element already and it does not matter whether _the list is sorted or not_. But sorting makes certain optimization easier to realize. I.e. one scan of the _entire_ list is required to find all elements with same value, therefore a _single_ cache miss has the same cost as _many more_ cache misses if the list is unsorted.\n\nComment: @peter - so what, the time it takes to put a result into the cache is the same for a sorted array and an unsorted array?\n\nComment: @UncleBodhisattva: No, the time to put something into the cache is usually measured in nanoseconds... but it's what I said.\n\nComment: @peter It looks like UncleBodhisattva's problem is about _finding_ elements in the array, which would be something a cache miss can only hide _once_, and therefore it's _not_ \"the time to put something into cache is usually measured in nanoseconds\": the _single first_ access to the cache will cause either a cache hit or a miss, regardless of array being sorted or not, which is why my answer mentioned only \"it is faster because it is easier to _search_ certain elements\" \u2014 just not all, as you hinted about too ;)\n\nComment: @IvanFiorese: Sure. My comment was only a side note, my main point was that the time to put something into the cache is usually measured in milliseconds. So you can either use an index or a range or the entire array to access elements. In the case of the entire array, we're talking about nanoseconds, but in the other 2 cases, it's still _milliseconds_.\n\nComment: @peter: Sorry if I was implying you made a mistake ;) I was just saying the result of your answer would be slightly different if the example was made of getting an item from the cache instead of looking for values in the array.\n\nComment: Well, the example is _\"looking for values in the array\"_. You can't change that, at least, from this point of view ;) A range or an index is a way to search for values, _exactly_ as this code did in the question.\n\nComment: It's interesting if you just want to sort that, why not sort it first and then check against the sorted version?

I can't use Power BI's Pivots or Data Mining because I will be processing hundreds of thousand of excel files and I have to do something in between (extract the table and do stuff with the table)\n\nAnswer: To load and read the table data from workbook and convert it into your required \\begin{code}\nList<ExcelData>\n\\end{code} you can use the following example which uses the `ExcelTable` class of [EPPlus NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EPPlus/) and provides an easy and simple way to load a Worksheet object, an Exclu table and then extract the data as required.\n\n\\begin{code}\nstring fileName = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Desktop\\\\ExcelFile.xlsx\";\n\n//Load Excel\nvar package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(fileName));\nWorkbook workBook = package.Workbook;\n\n//Get worksheet object\nWorksheet sheet = workBook.Worksheets[\"Sheet1\"];\n\n//Get Excel table\n//This will get the entire table\nvar excelTable = sheet.Tables.First();\n\n//If your table name is not Sheet1 then use ExcelTable.GetExcelTable( sheet.Name );\n\n//Loop through the columns of the table\nforeach (ExcelTableColumn column in excelTable.Columns)\n{\n    //Loop through the table rows\n    foreach (var dataRow in excelTable.Rows)\n    {\n        //Get the data value of given row and column\n        string value = string.Empty;\n        if (dataRow != null)\n        {\n            value = string.Concat(dataRow[column.Name]);\n        }\n        Debug.WriteLine(value);\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Update:} After this answer, I came across EPPlus' `ExcelReader` class that reads the excel table data very easily and in an easy-to-understand method rather than using `DataReader` methods which not much simple and hard to understand.\n\n\\begin{code}\nvoid ReadExcelTableData()\n{\n    string fileName = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Desktop\\\\ExcelFile.xlsx\";\n\n    //Load Excel\n    var package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(fileName));\n    Worksheet sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets[1];\n\n    //Get Excel table\n    var excelTable = sheet.Tables.First();\n    //If your table name is not Sheet1 then use ExcelTable.GetExcelTable( sheet.Name );\n\n    var tableData = excelTable.ReadToDataSource();\n\n    string[] colNames = tableData.GetColumns();\n\n    Console.Write(\"Read : \");\n    foreach (string name in colNames)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(name);\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nNow to access the values just use the below code\n\n\\begin{code}\nvoid GetExcelTableData(ExcelTable excelTable, string tableHeader)\n{\n    Console.Clear();\n\n    var tableData = excelTable.ReadToDataSource();\n\n    var tableHeaderNames = tableData.GetColumns();\n\n    var count = ((string[])(tableData.GetRows())).GetCount();\n    var rowIndex = 0;\n\n    //Print header\n    foreach (var colName in tableHeaderNames)\n    {\n        Console.Write(colName);\n        Console.Write(\"|\");\n        rowIndex++;\n    }\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    foreach (var colName in tableHeaderNames)\n    {\n        var colValues = ((string[])(tableData.GetRows())).GetItem(colName);\n        var length = colValues.GetLength(0);\n\n        if (length > 0)\n        {\n            Debug.WriteLine(\"Values : [\" + colValues[rowIndex - 1] + \"]\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nIn the above method, I am using it with the table header `Sheet1`, so it will get just the headers of sheet data.\n\n`tableheader` - here I used with 'Sheet1'\n\n\\section{\n\nReading the table with columns `C4:E6` or in `column` order is very easy using the `Worksheet.GetRowValues()` method\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Get the excel table\n\\item Get rid of table header, here it is `Sheet1` just because the workbook is the 1st worksheet\n\\item Read the dataset object with the column order to get the Excel table with `C4:E6` order in it\n\\item Get rows of the dataset object\n\\item Get the values in column order\n\\item Write in Console\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"read : \");\n\nvar tableData = sheet.GetRowValues();\n\ntableData.ColumnOrder = new ColumnOrder[] { \"A\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\" };\n\ntableData.ColumnHeaders = false;\n\nforeach (var colName in tableHeaderNames)\n{\n\n    string[] colArray = ((string[])(tableData.GetRowValues()).GetItem(colName)).GetArray();\n\n    if (colArray != null && colArray.Length != 0)\n    {\n        string colValue = string.Concat(colArray[1]);\n        console.Write(colValue);\n\n    }\n}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: How did you get the first line of the data? Is this all you want from the excel file, or are you trying to get all the rows?\n\nComment: Thanks. I ended up going with GetColumns() because it was very easy to use in my context.\n\nComment: For those who have used ExcelTable and have done their data to be stored in a List<DataRow>, there is an overload for GetColumns that accepts an excelDataList argument.   https://epplus.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#Samples/DataColumns.cs\n\nComment: When i use this code `var colNames = tableData.GetColumns();\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < colNames.Length; i++)\n         {\n             Console.Write(colNames[i] + \"  \");\n         }` i get this error `GetColumns returned multiple values for argument i. Parameter name: i`\n\nComment: @KevinLord: For looping columns you must use `GetArray()` instead of `GetItems()` as `GetItems()` methods return a list of object and can't be used for looping.

In this article, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explain Array.prototype.forEach() and what can be done with that looping method when iterating through arrays in JavaScript. You can use the loop function \"for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)\" to iterate the array elements. How to get rid of 40mph top speed limit on Yamaha snowmobile? For each (or for loop) statements is usually used to generate nested arrays, where the length of each nested array is dynamic. A collection is an array, object, array-like object (which may or may not be actually an array), or even iterable object. Note that \"for..in\" is different from for..of. How do you know the number between two numbers only? The let and const are keywords in Javascript. Note that we\u2019re using strict equality checks. This solution can be as simple as: var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]; var sum = 0; for (var i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) { sum += numbers[i];} console.log(sum); However, in this case it\u2019s a better practice to just pass it in as a number value: var sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i<5 ;i++) { sum += i; } let result = sum; // result would \u2026 Example 1 : To calculate the sum of an array of floating point numbers. 3. This allows us to treat the collection not as a plain array, but as an iterable object and do everything that iterable objects allow. JavaScript for\u2026of() has an edge on . The for..of() Loop is an iterative loop, meaning, it runs until an exception or terminating condition is detected, or it runs a pre-determined number of times. JavaScript For Of Loop is one of the most popular JavaScript loop. Javascript Tutorial For Loop is used to Loop through the array, variable, object or any other data type. The \"in\" test here is not the one we normally use for arrays. Iterate over each (one by one) element of the array using arrow function. In this article, we'll explain what it is and how to use it. We can use the following syntax: let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { sum += numbers[i]; } let result = sum; Output. The code below will run faster than the one with the for-in loop, because it avoids doing a key lookup. One common use of the for-in loop is to access the properties of an object. Using the above for\u2026of() method, we are iterating over an array of objects and returning the number of objects. When the data is in an array, this loop works the best. Loop over objects Array.prototype.forEach() Array.prototype.forEach() is a method in JavaScript Array object that loops over the array elements and calls the callback function (iterate over array in javascript) with every element as parameter.. In the above example, i = 0 to i = 4 . But be aware that as the name suggests, this is an iterator, and it doesn't alter the collection it's looping over. But be aware that as the name suggests, this is an iterator, and it doesn't alter the collection it's looping over. The for... in loop, also known as the forEach loop, iterates over the entries of an Object. The for in loop or forEach loop is a JavaScript loop which iterates over the properties of an object. If you're using ES6 and up, you can use the Array.from() method to convert any iterable object into an array. In this example, we\u2019re looping through the properties of a custom object and summing up each entry. A for statement provides an easy and efficient way to repeat a block of code. Let\u2019s imagine this method is to sum all the elements in an array and we will try and see how both ways of iterating through an array of multiple objects. We are going to use a for loop to do that. When the data is in an array, this loop works the best. 05, Mar 20. JavaScript for\u2026of() has an edge on . I\u2019ll go through this method in the next few examples, to illustrate its use, but for now consider this to be the basic method to loop over an object\u2019s properties. As you\u2019ve come to know, forEach() method in JavaScript loops through the objects or arrays one at a time and then does something with them. That will let us access the second, third and then even the fourth element on every iteration, something that for\u2026of() doesn\u2019t let you achieve. Let\u2019s build the above example with each() method and then compare it with for\u2026of() method. The last index should be used to determine when the loop is exited. (1) The forEach method of Array class or any other iterable object iterates through all elements of an array/an object. The Array.forEach() method has been designed to loop over every object. But there is no way to declare it as one. 3. In javascript, for loop is mainly used for printing and modifying the arrays or any other data types. for statement. var counter = 0; //for the total amount to be printed for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { counter += arr[i]; } console.log(counter); // result would be 22. So the first value is 1, the second is 2, and then so on. It will be very easy to understand if we break down the syntax and look at each part of it separately. This is the one that goes for in loops, the one that gives us access to all the properties of an object. Learn how to generate an array of arrays with each() method in ES6 JavaScript and for...of() loops with every() method in JavaScript. In JavaScript the for-in loop allows you to loop over an object. The simplest way to create a for...of loop, is to call the Array.prototype.forEach method to loop through an array of objects. It is used to loop over an array of objects and return the total number of objects. 02, Sep 20. But be aware that as the name suggests, this is an iterator, and it doesn't alter the collection it's looping over. We will use the for..of() syntax to generate the same results. Let\u2019s understand with an example. The for of loop constructs a new JavaScript Array object by converting an iterable object for us. In the example below, I declared a new variable, the total, and set it to 0 like I always do when I write a for loop. The for-in construct allows you to iterate over objects even if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a property called length, in fact the for-in is the only way to loop over objects in JavaScript (well there is another way but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole other story). You will often get a faster code for nested for-in, even if the object has a length and the nested loop has only a small number of iterations. In the above example, we declared var myArray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"pineapple\"]; I know that you can use the .map() or .reduce() methods to produce this effect. I have to write a for- of loop with the loop variable beeing the result from another for-if-loop, does any one know if this possible or I have to write the for-loop with a for-variable to be able to do this? How does javascript let/const work in for-of loop? It uses for-in loop to loop over an object and returns the total number of objects contained in the object. JavaScript Array.forEach(), Array.reduce() and Array.reduceRight() Methods Explained. Loop over objects. To access the properties and values of object, we can do two ways: for-in loop and forEach() which is faster than for..in loop. JavaScript's for..in syntax loops through the properties of an object. The code below will run faster than the one with the for-in loop\u00e2\u0080\u00a6, but you get an extra bonus with the for.. of method which is an iterator, meaning that it acts like the iterator object passed into a jQuery .each() function. I was wondering if there was a way to use the for\u2026of to create an array of values from an object.. Here, we'll go through it with the help of examples. It is used to loop over every property (key) of the object, and it iterates over all properties in its order. Each time through the loop, it checks if obj is null or undefined (using the instanceof operator). I don\u2019t use it in production because of a side effect it produces, namely, the generation of an array of all the objects (not just their property values). I'll explain an each() method that is provided in ES6 syntax. Here, the first element is passed to the array for a function to execute once. However, if performance is a concern, you can use the for\u2026of syntax, which is faster than the for..in loop. The for of loop goes through every property/key in an object in one go, looping over the key name (without the index value or dot) rather than the property/key's value, so that you can access the key name multiple times in the loop.. Here's how to use them in JavaScript. The Array.from() method is used to convert an argument of any iterable object into an array. for-in loop, also known as the forEach loop, iterates over the properties of an object. The properties of the object have to be iterated over, therefore the value of result needs to keep changing value, which is exactly what the .forEach() method does. Now, on to the meat of this article: how to use the for..of() loop. The JavaScript for..of() loop is an iterative loop, meaning, it runs until an exception or terminating condition is detected, or it runs a \u2026 JavaScript's for..in syntax loops through the properties of an object. But forEach only iterates over one item at a time, whereas the for...in loop gets called on every property - be it arrays, functions, objects or whatever \u2013 which is sometimes problematic. Use the for loop to iterate over all arrays defined in the current script: for (var array1 in arrays) { // do something with the array1 object. } This can only be achieved by the for..of () loop. I'm having trouble with an index variable within the for..of object. Array.prototype.forEach() The best way to loop through an array objects is using for() statements. In this article, we'll explain what it is and how to use it. Note that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using strict equality checks. The for..in syntax isn't used to loop over the properties of an object. The Array.forEach() method has been designed to loop over every object. A for statement provides an easy and efficient way to repeat a block of code. The for..of syntax does however have the benefit of being an iterator, meaning that it will not alter the object in any way during the iteration and is therefore generally considered a better alternative for iteration over objects. That will let us access the second, third and then so on.. The for in loop or forEach loop is a JavaScript loop which iterates over the properties of an object. This loop operates by calling a provided function once for each array element. For instance, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the return value will be 6. The for..in loop is used to loop over the properties of an object and returns undefined on iteration beyond the end of the object. You have to use the for..of() loop when you want to keep a record of the length of every iteration and when you only have a loop condition for one iteration, as in: the condition in the example above is different from the previous two because the for..in loop needs to know that the condition should only be evaluated at the first iteration of the for..in loop. When the variable is set to value, the loop starts with the second term 4 and goes on till the \u2026 Note that we\u2019ll have to add the second term 4 to the product so that it keeps increasing. Let\u2019s imagine this method is to sum all the elements in an array and we will try and see how both ways of iterating through an array of multiple objects. As you'll see in a second it is a bit trickier because it does not keep track of the iteration variable between each loop in the for..of(). The first expression of this syntax creates an array with all the \u2026 The Array.forEach() method has been designed to loop over every object. In this article, we'll explain what it is and how to use it. JavaScript for..of() loops over iterable objects, which means that you can use it on the properties of any object, even if it's not an array. The best way to loop through an array objects is using for() statements. It would be the second term of the equation which is 4 so the answer would be 6 * 4. In this tutorial we will learn How to write for..of() loop in javascript? Javascript Loop Arrays in For Loop JavaScript. And a faster way to loop through objects is by the for-in syntax. Note that the same syntax works just as well in ES5, it is however a bit more complicated in IE8+ and you need an array if you are going to use that syntax in those browsers. The for..in loop is used to loop over the properties of an object and returns undefined on iteration beyond the end of the object. But there\u2019s also a third way to loop over an object by using the for\u2026of method, which generates an array of all its properties. The iteration of for in and for of loops in JavaScript is a function which can be called repeatedly without changing the state of the loop. The following is a for\u2026of loop that will generate an array of numbers from 0 to 10. How can I get the value of a cell in Excel based on the value of another cell? Let's loop through a simple array. A for statement provides an easy and efficient way to repeat a block of code. for (let i = 0 ; i < arr.length; i++) { sum += 1; } JavaScript for\u2026of() has an edge on \u2026 The for-in construct iterates over key names (and not values) as you loop over an object in JavaScript. In this tutorial, we'll go through using the for..of() loop in JavaScript. What's the best way to achieve this? What is the reason for calling \"test\". When the value is in the range of \u2026 The for..in syntax isn't used for loop over the properties of an object. As I said above, the for\u2026of() method builds up an array on each iteration through the loop. This can only be achieved by the for..of () loop. Here, the first element is passed to the array for a function to execute once. The for..of() loop doesn\u2019t have an index variable. What is the purpose of the for-of loop? A for statement provides an easy and efficient way to repeat a block of code. In this example, we\u2019ll create an array [\u201ca\u201d,\u201db\u201d,\u201dc\u201d,\u201cd\u201d] and use the .forEach() loop to iterate over every element in the array. JavaScript Array .forEach() method is used to iterate the elements of an array, and apply a provided function once for each of them. (If you find that you can do it as easily without \"for..of\", there's your answer: you don't need for..of.) But there is no way to declare it as one. How to use the for..of() loop. By the way, this isn't the only iteration to use iteration as a keyword, in some languages loop is used in that way and as an identifier for the loop condition. So, use loops for \u2026 This will generate an array with all the keys from the object. The for-in loop doesn\u2019t have an index or a check after that for the final item in that loop. for each (or for loop) statements is usually used to generate nested arrays, where the length of each nested array is dynamic. Use the for..in and forEach methods. var counter = 0; //for the total amount to be printed for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { counter += arr[i]; } console.log(counter); // result would be 22. The code below will run faster than the one with the for-in loop, because it avoids doing a key lookup. Here, we'll go through different types of loop in \u2026 How do I split a string on a single delimiter in Java? I don\u2019t use it in production because of a side effect it produces, namely, the generation of an array of all the objects (not just their property values). JavaScript Loop Arrays in For Loop JavaScript. The for..of syntax loops over the objects and returns undefined on iteration beyond the end of the object. These examples of for-of construct are mostly for \u2026 So, I will use this for..of() style of loops for every iteration I do below. A for statement provides an easy and efficient way to repeat a block of code. JavaScript Tutorial. That\u2019s a different way to create the same array, although using for..of() to generate this array gives us a bit of overhead. JavaScript Array For-Of Construct. In this article, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn how to use the for.. of method. var myArray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\", \"pineapple\"]; How can I get the value of a cell in Excel based on the value of another cell? The reason is that objects aren't arrays, and when you use the [\u2026] syntax it is interpreted as an array. I don't recommend ever using an array of arrays as a data source for an iterator, like forEach, map or filter. This works great when you only have one or two conditions and there\u2019s no easy way to keep track the index of the iteration in each iteration \u2026 This article explains...

The first iteration works the best way to repeat a of an each ( or for iteration, using for( loop the for (. Of array in loop to print the for in each iteration, or the next of the for-of method. By the for-of with the of loop is to repeat a set iteration, the for-of the iteration over one value, repeat a value, for. Is there are iterable object and do everything that iterable object. The loop example is used when iterable with the same JavaScript 's no way to this with objects even if the same each loop, for the i. The for (\u2026of (each iteration will run faster than iteration in this (i +=i 4. The loop to the for-of (//i 3 as each iteration of the value of the iteration i with iteration as shown the above. For example with the each item with the following iteration an array loop. Loop works the iteration in Javascript. The iteration. The for-of (i-index, each for (iterate for each. for-of \u2026 A for (array of i each (as each. The for each way to 05 the for-out of the following to use the for-in this is faster than each each loop through the same code is used as many for (and this: in-out in the for each other iterations of the iteration goes to 0.

I don't need that delay actually. The delay is just there so that it is synchronized as much as possible with my JS code. And, if it uses an `await`, it makes the code ugly because it looks like `async function(delay=0) { /* delay function */ }`, where the `delay` argument doesn't actually delay anything. I'd simply remove the arguments from the delay, if I'd make my function synchronized...\n\nComment: I added a comment on the other answer, if you are interested\n\nComment: If my delay returns a promise, I can now use promises with `await`, right? As I have been trying to work with `await` without any luck, it does not look that straightforward for me.\n\nComment: @TakuMikami No - why does that matter? And the call to `await delay(5000)` is never going to come off the event loop; the `Promise` will be in the `await`ed `delay` call's execution context. I suppose that you could put `setTimeout` in a `.then()` to make it async and *then* await that. *Honestly - just use `setTimeout` - it's fine, nobody is going to care if it's not the optimal solution*\n\nComment: @Bergi I added an answer.\n\nComment: I'd argue it'd be a good idea not to make your functions return a promise (or anything), if at all possible. If you need the return value of a function, take that function as argument, like `async function delay(ms, sayHello) { ... }(5000, sayHello)`.\n\nComment: It doesn't matter that the two functions make promises because the two functions are called in a row. I.e. if `await delay(9999)` (i.e. `await delay(7xmaxPromiseDelay)`) - then `sayHello('Alice')` runs after the call to `async`.\n\nComment: @LivioAurigemma - It should be noted that the function `syncTest = function (delay_ms = 0, sayHello) { ... }` is synchronous from `console.log('Hello, ' + name)` onward; the `console.log(...)` is synchronous in that it is *from then on* not awaitable.\n\nComment: That's the exact same problem I was mentioning in my first comment. There isn't a way to make it *synchronous*, right?\n\nComment: @user13882677 I'm really not sure what you mean by \"not to make my functions return a promise\" ... returning the Promise \"makes it synchronous\" ... ?\n\nComment: The question is: what to *do* with it? In this case you could pass the entire function in one argument: `function delay(ms, sayHello) { setTimeout(function() { sayHello('Alice'); }, ms); };`. The promise then is *held* in memory until it resolves, allowing the outer function to react to it.\n\nComment: @Bergi I can't wait for your comment below to get an answer ...\n\nComment: @user13882677 So when are you planning to answer, then? I can't help you to find a working solution ;-)\n\nComment: @Bergi [I need some time ... and I'd love feedback (from you, I mean)]\n\nComment: Hi - just a small thing that didn't matter until now: If I wrap, let's say, `function delay(ms) { setTimeout(function() { sayHello('Alice'); }, ms); }` around `async function sayHello(name) { ... }` ... then my script looks like: `async function sayHello(name) { try { await delay(9999); } catch(err) { console.error(err); console.log('Hello, ' + name); } }` ... And if `await delay(9999)` (I.e. `await delay(7*maxPromiseDelay)`) then, at least so far the `console.log(name)` doesn't seem to execute ...\n\nComment: @user13882677 I think you need to await for the timeout - `async function sayHello(name) { try { await delay(9999); } catch(err) { ... } catch (err) { ... } }}`. You can't await async without it being true.\n\nComment: @VLAZ what do you mean when you say \"if you want to be really paranoid ...\" ?\n\nComment: @user13882677 I mean that you are unnecessarily complicating yourself (and your code). The solution is to declare the delay as synchronous function from the start, and the code you wrote in your question shows that the code can also be done purely with synchronous code.\n\nAnswer: The problem is you are waiting for the promise \\strong{\\em{after}} you've delayed it:\n\n\\begin{code}\n   try {\n        await delay(9999); // delay will finish, and then wait for async to be done\n    } catch(err) {\n        console.error(err); // wait for this too\n        console.log('Hello, ' + name);\n    }\n\\end{code}\n\n[Try it online](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/C4TwDgpgBA8gGwpgKZKAgOwA0gDsF5iYAUFQDwALxQB6AuAewBZAoATwAKBWAdYGUcANHYgAnT1pJZrAYkANZ0xwWaQBd3d8IUaJyAJuDxjA3a7kC3QbW6VKXxdQqX3mhxVxQA3QACtOx0A0m7AAGsAIkBQxk0AFyxwKNxBGAA3aKxhZ25cBXNjc3FwC2xAAYlAApU5AYoAqQbD4MhCAB8Y4NxbP0Bz0sBVdAf2qAJKhDYgB3BgAJU3MvA9wD4C7UAAUiVUAH4wZm03qF02bQDlwKKnhDAAqDqEAJgH05yWx87YJ3U10+LVlYIjCADkp+3ZIp0A)\n\nYou could await the delay promise with `async`:\n\n\\begin{code}\nasync function sayHello(name) {\n    await delay(9999); // after delay finished, you await before calling sayHello\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nBut you'd best pass the `delay` function to your 'syncTest':\n\n\\begin{code}\nasync function syncTest(delay = 0) {\n    await delay(9999); // after delay finished, you await before calling async\n    console.log('Hello, ' + name);\n    sayHello(name); // sayHello is now also async (because of await)\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n[Try it online](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/C4TwDgpgBA8gGwpgKZKAgOwA0gDsF5iYAUFQDwALxQB6AuAewBZAoATwAKBWAdYGUcANHYgAnT1pJZrAYkANZ0xwWaQBd3d8IUaJyAJuDxjA3a7kC3QbW6VKXxdQqX3mhxVxQA3QACtOx0A0m7AAGsAIkBQxk0AFyxwKNxBGAA3aKxhZ25cBXNjc3FwC2xAAYlAApU5AYoAqQbD4MhCAB8Y4NxbP0Bz0sBVdAf2qAJKhDYgB3BgAJU3MvA9wD4C7UAAUiVUAH4wZm03qF02bQDlwKKnhDAAqDqEAJgH05yWx87YJ3U10+LVlYIjCADkp+3ZIp0A)\n\nComment: Thank you so much ... that is a very elegant approach; I just needed to use the `await` in the 'syncTest' and pass the `async function` there.

C++ supports two different kinds of functions: class functions and standard functions.\nThe print function allows you to print strings, to display them. The str variable value is not returned; hence it does not belong to the scope to which the print function.\nPython: Creating and returning values from a function. To create and return values from functions, we will need two main functions. First of all, the class with the function definitions. We will create the class and define the two functions. In this instance, the function is a \u201chello\u201d function.\nFunction definition. You can define a function by using the following syntax. Here, number_gen is a function in the name. This function returns an integer.\nWhat is a function in Python? A Python function is a set of statements that perform an operation given by the input parameter passed in the function call.\nIn this case, the function will print the value of x to the console and returns y. In Python, you have two ways to return a value from a function: By explicitly using the return statement. By calling the return value of another function inside the original function. Print() function.\nPrint the value of y in the browser window. As of Python 2.0, you can use print() to output formatted strings to the standard output. You need parentheses with both Python-level and C-level outputs, just as with assignment statements: >>> print(42) print(42) >>>\nA function definition is a definition consisting of an opening function keyword, followed by a function parameter list enclosed in parentheses, followed by one or more function statement pairs (statements that include a semi-colon) until the closing parenthesis; the function statement is followed by either a statement or a function definition body.\nIs the \"i_am_root\" method defined on the 'subprocess' class? Ask Question Asked 12 years, 1 month ago. Active 2 years, 7 months ago.\nI got the answer from the previous discussion. The value of variable x does not exist at the scope of the print function, thus it returns 'None'. The print function does print the value of the print object (a string) as you can see.\nIn Python, if a function is not defined, it is not executed. This might sound odd, because after all, Python is a dynamic language, and the name of the function can be anything. And if the name is anything, it should be executable, right? Defining functions. By default the print() built-in function returns the None value. This means in the following examples the variable 'a' is undefined and does not exist.\nPython print function. The print() function in Python is a useful built-in function that can be used to display strings and other objects in Python.\nThere are other functions available within Python that can print some basic data without using the print function. We will learn them in other tutorials. Note: If you use a method or function within another function, you will need to use the name of that function instead of x.\nThe print function in Python is built-in. Print functions do not have to be imported. To call a print function, you don\u2019t even need to give it one of your variables as an argument.\nThe function definition has the format: def function_name (arg1, arg2, ... ): and the def function is also part of the function definition.\nPython allows the user to create or build their own custom functions using a specific syntax. We will now create and understand the code which allows you to define the function and then call it as a method or function.\nA function is a block of code which performs a specific task and can be called by passing inputs to it. In Python, users write functions with the help of a function definition syntax (or function definition). To demonstrate, we will take an example of a simple Python function \"add()\".\nYou need to find the value of x. The value of x is 3. 1. In all cases, the variables are initialized, and their values can be obtained by getting the values of the variables outside the function. When the function is called, its parameters are passed into the function.\nWhy is this Python code not printing anything? \"def hello(name): print ('Hello, ' + name) hello() Hello\" eria Uncle iter PostEqual margin Tat: 0 0:55 PM.\nI define a function, but it doesn't print anything: print(add_func) Python 3.7 (default, Jun 20 2019, 19:20:25) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\nFunction definition is - a group of letters, numbers, and symbols used especially by a system of writing to indicate meaning and aid in communication. How to use function in a sentence.\nYou need to define x first, and you need to print x to the console before the value of x has been defined. This is what is known as a runtime error. Functions do not operate at compile time, and hence you cannot use code that depends on the value of a variable at compile time in a function.\nPython function definition. A function is a section of code that performs a certain operation, based on the data supplied to it. A function is usually defined with one or more parameters, along with a body or set of lines to carry out the function. What is a Function? Python functions are used to carry out a specific operation.\nYou can use functions as methods of a class because they are basically the same construct: a block of code that performs a task. What is wrong with this approach? Python is an extremely flexible and versatile language. One of the beauties of Python is that you can program in it the way that is most natural to you..\nPython function definition. A function is a section of code that performs a certain operation, based on the data supplied to it. A function is usually defined with one or more parameters, along with a body or set of lines to carry out the function. function definition: 1. the definition of what a word or phrase means: 2. a definition of something written down, often. Learn more. Python function definition.\nPython function definition. For example, you could have a simple function that converts temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit, like so:. The function we just wrote is known as a def function. The term def comes from the first two letters of the words \u201cdefine,\u201d and as you can see, the term also works in text messages.\nThe function which we will define is a function for printing a text string that gives you the list of arguments to the function. This function is a simple one because it just prints a text string that is a list of two arguments. How to create a Python Function.\nI define a function, but it doesn't print anything: print(add_func) Python 3.7 (default, Jun 20 2019, 19:20:25) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] > Add Function to add_func print(input(\u201cEnter the first value: \u201c), \u201c\\n\u201d, input(\u201cEnter the second value: \u201c) )\nHow much does a nissan 4 door weigh?", "num_tokens_generated": 2027, "OGF": 0.494873046875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 47.195444107055664, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 145, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

It doesn\u2019t take much effort when you\u2019re looking for a car from around 300,000 yen to 500,000 yen and less than 500,000 yen. Avoid 500,000 yen and less than 100,000 yen. It\u2019s not always a problem to have an accident or get hurt or be damaged at the time of the traffic accident or car accident, so please pay attention to the car accident countermeasure. It is recommended that you carefully check whether you can purchase a car, whether you can continue to operate or whether you can drive it. Please be careful when purchasing or purchasing a used car. In addition, there is also a car loan. If you think that you can\u2019t live a comfortable life with a cheap car, please stop the car and think about it, and wait until it is possible to make a living without a car. Cars are not a necessity. In the case of an accident, car accidents, or car accident injuries, if the loss is not compensated, it is necessary to negotiate with the insurance company, so please be careful. In addition, we also have a consultation service on how to calculate compensation for a car accident. Please feel free to use it. I think there is no problem if you buy a used car. But to be honest, there are many differences between used cars and used cars.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJEk7rH61DY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJEk7rH61DY", "num_tokens_generated": 1041, "OGF": 0.254150390625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 23.509933471679688, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 149, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

I know it's not a race, but this is the only metric that is available to me to estimate how far behind he was.\nThe fastest speed a car can go around a circuit is limited by the size of the engine; for a given fuel capacity, there's only a certain amount of energy a car can store in its fuel. You therefore go as fast as you can while conserving fuel, which can be done in part by throttling back as much as necessary. So it's really the average speed, not the fastest speed, that matters.\nYou must know how many hours into the race you were running.

There are other less commonly known styles as well, such as Kajukenbo (a blend of the Filipino and Japanese martial arts), Taekwondo, and Aun Kenpo.\nDepending on your style choice, you should start out small and work your way up slowly. It\u2019s important not to rush things and push yourself into something you don\u2019t want or cannot handle. Instead, pick a style that fits your lifestyle and needs and explore it further from there.\nOnce you pick a style, research it extensively. If you\u2019re new to martial arts, research them all and try to decide which one best fits your current goals, interests, and desires.\nYou can do this pretty easily online, but also check out local clubs if they have a schedule of classes available to you.\nOnce you\u2019ve picked out your art style and gotten started, make sure to attend classes regularly. It\u2019s extremely important to get some quality martial arts training, especially if you are just starting out.\nAlthough it\u2019s difficult to know ahead of time what areas of the craft will be your strongpoints or weaknesses, once you have a good handle on what you can reasonably accomplish in your first few weeks of practice, and how quickly those improvements will accrue when it comes to developing an extensive skill set.\nHowever, there are many methods to learn martial arts that can save you a lot of time in the long run. We recommend signing up for a martial arts academy, where you\u2019ll learn from an experienced instructor who will guide you through all the techniques used in your chosen style.\nAnother popular solution is taking martial arts classes online. These platforms offer many benefits.\nFirst, they are very reasonably priced; they often cost less than a single day\u2019s wages at a martial arts academy. These online platforms also often provide video lessons with detailed step-by-step explanations, which means you know exactly what you\u2019re doing every single time you practice or spar.\nLearn More! 10 Best Martial Arts Schools in the Denver Area\nHow much do Martial Arts classes cost?\nHow much do Martial Arts classes cost? This question comes up a lot, especially for those considering taking a martial arts class for the first time. It is an important question, both for newcomers and experienced practitioners.\nHow much does a class cost? Is it cheaper (or more expensive!) to take martial arts instruction at home? How much does it cost to attend a weekly in-person class at your local martial arts studio?\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at some of the costs associated with martial arts classes. So let\u2019s begin with what a typical martial arts class costs, and some things you can do to help save money!\nFirst things first: how much do Martial Arts classes cost? Well, that depends on your goals and objectives. If you want to learn kung fu, you will likely pay more than someone who is just looking to learn a few self-defense techniques (you might even pay more than someone looking to learn a few other kinds of martial arts like judo or karate).\nIf you are planning to attend a class at a martial arts studio, you\u2019ll likely pay less than someone just out for self-defense training. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find a good deal on classes!\nMany martial arts studios have a monthly membership plan that works out to be cheaper than most one-time class rates, so it\u2019s a great way to save on future lessons!\nWe\u2019ve covered the basics of determining how much a class costs, but what about other costs associated with martial arts classes?\nLearn More! 10 Best Martial Arts Schools in the Dallas Area\nIs Karate Good for Teenagers?\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule that says when teenagers should start martial arts. The most appropriate age for someone to start martial arts varies greatly, depending on factors such as their weight, height, and maturity level.\nSome martial arts schools will allow teenagers as young as 10 years old to attend classes. Others will restrict younger teens to only 11-year-old classes. Some martial arts dojos have a minimum age requirement of 12, while others will let 13-year-olds begin taking classes.\nSome schools will even allow teens to start martial arts classes when they turn 14 or 15. The age at which teenagers can participate in martial arts depends on their individual needs and abilities and how they respond to the physical demands of the art.\nIs Karate Good for Teenagers?.\nHow Long Does it Take to Get to Black Belt?\nA black belt is a symbol of dedication, hard work and achievement. It can only be earned after many hours of practice and training under a skilled martial arts instructor.\nThe path to earning a black belt in karate is not an easy one and it takes considerable time, discipline and determination. To understand how long it might take to get out a belt in karate, it\u2019s important to understand what kind of dedication is required in the first place.\nHere are some factors to consider.\nFirstly, the amount of time needed for training depends on age group and what kind of martial arts style you\u2019re pursuing.\nYou should also take into account your current level of skill and fitness and the level of support offered by your school or organisation.\nFinally, you need to understand the various requirements involved in earning the black belt.

Ask people you know whether they have any recommendations, or use free resources like Google Maps and Yelp to find reviews from people with similar needs.\nThe more information you can gather on potential instructors, the better chance you have of finding someone who will give you the best training possible.\nWhile finding the best instructor may seem daunting at first, it\u2019s not as hard as you might think.
