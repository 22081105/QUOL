The longest lashes in the world belong to Shane Nolan. Shane Nolans lashes are 4.75 inches long. Thats over 12 centimetres. Shane Nolan's mother, Donna Nolan, has super-long lashes herself. Shane's father, Joe Nolan, believes that his grandfather, who also had long lashes, possesses a rare hereditary gene for exceptionally long lashes. Joe Nolan also believes that there is a possibility that it is not an inherited gene, but a chemical reaction that causes the long lashes. There is probably a chemical in Shanes sweat that is stimulating the growth of the eyelashes. This reaction may very well be a possible condition that is called pheromones. You've probably read about pheromones in women. If you havent, pheromones are chemicals in the human body that cause hormonal shifts to occur in the opposite sex. Women that have this condition give off a scent that drives men crazy! Shane Nolans eyelashes started to grow long while he was still in his mothers womb. The exact reason for his long eyelashes is unknown, but Shane Nolan considers it a gift. Nolan does get teased a lot, but he says he doesnt let it bother him too much. If you want to see Shane Nolans long eyelashes for yourself, go to the worlds longest eyelashes webpage at ( www.shanenolan.com/wlash.html ). Shane Nolans Lashes (4.75 in) (12.06 centimetres) (73 words)\nA Cool Video On The Worlds Longest Eyelashes\nThere is a very cool video on the worlds longest eyelashes. Shane Nolan has the longest eyelashes in the world. His lashes are 4.75 inches long. That is over 12 centimetres! Shane is from Swansea, Wales and he has lashes that are almost a foot long and when I say lashes, I mean his top one too. This is all due to a chemical that is in Shanes sweat and it is being called pheromones. Pheromones are a mixture of hormones that are secreted by an animals body. The hormones are secreted in excremation or waste products from the body. Humans also have pheromones but they only have about a tenth of what animals have. Males generally do not have as much of a mix of hormones then females do. It is thought that pheromones are how humans communicate their emotions. I guess when men are all out of beer, it would probably be a clue that they are angry. It has already been proved that Pheromones exist! Now it is all about finding a cure or a new type of pheromones! I just read a book called the Long Distance Relationship. It was a lot about how to tell if a person has the hormone. In the book I could tell you the 5 ways they knew if a girl was going to give a boy pheromones, but this is not the place for that. To learn more about pheromones and shanes eyelashes, go to this video ( www.shanenolan.com/wlash.html). See his Lashes (4.75 in) (12.06 centimes) (49 words)\nLong Distance Relationships - Do They Last?\nHave you ever had a long distance relationship? I personally have never had one before, but from what I have heard, they are a hard kind of relationship to have and have trouble maintaining as well as getting through. It is really hard to have any sort of relationship long distance, especially one that is just starting to take place. Many different things can occur when a couple decides to have a long distance relationship. Some things that will occur are; a lot of phone calls, writing each other letters, maybe even a few presents, and a lot of missing the partner. I have always looked at long distance relationships as people that are on a break, or people that are not interested in the relationship anymore and want to be polite to one another. But after thinking about it and hearing some of the different stories of long distance relationships, I have a different view and feel of this matter. I do not think they will work out too many times, but there are some exceptions to that. From hearing all of the different experiences of having a long distance relationship, I have learned that it all depends on the couple. The type of people they are, the trust level, and how they care for one another. I have learned that all of these relationships are different. Long distance relationships can happen for different reasons, so I think it is kind of hard to say that a lot of people that have had these types of relationships fail. I have a hard time saying that when a couple decides to have a long distance relationship, for example; I cannot imagine a couple that have had a long distance relationship for about 3 years and then just getting back together and living the rest of their lives happily. It is all about getting through the hard times, and trying to work things out. It is all about being patient and having trust. Long distance relationships are possible, and there are a lot of people out there that are in ones. To me, as long as the couple is in love with each other and wants to work stuff out, they can last. Maybe not for too long, but when one of them moves it may not last as long. ( words)\nIn the story, long distance relationships are very prominent. They represent the problems and emotions people have dealing with this difficult relationship. There are many different views of if this type of relationship can last. Some say yes and some say no. If you have never been, would like to be or maybe just heard about them, they can be very confusing and hard to manage. When two people start up a friendship, many times they both get very head over heels in like for each other, and then all of the sudden they just go their separate ways and decide that they do not want to be long distance anymore. I think that the couple should continue to talk to each other while they are apart. This way, they stay in contact and keep the friendships going. That will make it a lot easier to come back when the time is right. This shows that you really care about that person enough to want to hear from them and make sure they are ok and not lonely. If it really makes you homesick, and you really want to be with that person, then I would have a little faith and give it a try. Maybe you have never even thought about long distance relationships, but I am sure that you may have or will experience this in your life. They can be hard on couples in the beginning of their relationship. If you have any type of relationship that has a lot of travel involved, it may happen. I just wish that these types of relationships would be looked at differently by the general public. There are some out there that will say that these types of relationships will not work out because there are going to be so many arguments or heartbreaks, but if it is meant to be they will make it. (128 words\nThe Longest Word In The English Language\nThe longest English word, believed to be the longest word in the English language, is 1,909 letters! How does one even pronounce such a word? This word is pronounced as 'antidisestablishmentarianism'. It has eighteen syllables! To make it easier for the pronunciation, this word could be shortened to the acronym 'ADD'. The word is used to describe the opponents of the 1869 act of endowing the University of Tasmania. This word should be used only in formal writing, as it is too long for casual conversations. This word is not as common as it once was, as no other English words with such huge lengths of letters are used commonly. (118 words\nA very long word (15 letters)\nThe longest word in the world is found only in this book, and you cannot find it anywhere else. This is probably because, as the longest word in the world, it does not exist. What you need to understand is that you cannot find a word in the worlds vocabulary that has the same number of letters as this word. What follows here is the world's longest word. It contains the entire english vocabulary. This word is 15 letters long, and contains a total of 21,059 words in its definition. This is due to the lack of order in this word, and the fact that the same word could be said in several different ways. For example: 'Tonight' could be said in several different ways. You could say it as 'tonight', as 'tonite', as 'tonight', or even as '' 'To 'NIGHT!' To use this word in a sentence, you should find 15 friends who know each other, and get these 15 people to write their names on 15 pieces of paper. Then, put all of these papers in a hat and ask one of your friends to pick out a piece without looking at the paper. You should then ask one of your other friends, 'Hey, did you know that?' (This 'friend' should be the person who received the paper from the hat) The friend who asked the question should ask this second person what the sentence was. For example: 'Did you know that I like strawberry cake?' As you can see, it is very important to find people that know each other, so that they do not try to cheat (which is very illegal and should not be done). This word is very long because it contains every word, letter, number, and symbol that is present in the english language. This means that you should be careful when using this word because it will contain thousands of definitions, each of which would take a long time to read. If you use this word in a sentence, you should also make sure you're prepared to spend many months of time trying to understand what you just said. (89 words)\nWhat Long Distance Relationships Are About\nMany people are confused and intimidated by long-distance relationships. They see these relationships as weak and not as committed and long-lasting as one in which a couple is able and ready to be permanently apart. The only true way to see long-distance relationships is to be and remain committed to the relationship for as long as you can. The fact of the matter is that, when people make these decisions, it is very difficult to do and they often times wonder if it is right or wrong. If a person is committed to the relationship and is ready to be permanently separated with their partner, it is not a weak or flawed relationship. These relationships are a commitment that requires strength and endurance to remain together. So what are long distance relationships about? There is no one definition that holds true to each relationship. In fact, each time a man moves for a new job or begins to attend graduate school, he may also develop a long distance relationship and still have a long-term, committed marriage. This is when he has to decide whether his relationship is worth it. There are many people who think that a long-distance relationship is not really a committed relationship since it is different than the type of relationship that usually remains intact. However, since it is a relationship that is committed to the distance, it still should be considered strong since it still requires a commitment. There are many people who develop these relationships without even knowing each other and then fall head over heals in love. That is not a long-distance relationship, but it is a relationship at that time and a relationship that is able to be committed and long-lasting. If a person is commiated to a relationship, it is still a committed relationship, even if the two people are separated by long distance. (109 words)\nThe Longest Road In The United States\nThe longest road in the United States can be found in Alaska. This road starts in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Canada, and ends in Delta Junction, Alaska. The original length of the Alaska Highway is 1,622 miles long. However, there are several shorter routes, and these routes could potentially extend the length of the road even further. The highway was designed to provide relief supplies, as well as to support US troops as part of the battle against Japan in World War ll. In 1942, President Roosevelt authorized the Army to construct the Alaska Highway to provide a more secure route for Americans to travel to Alaska. The project was put on hold for a spell of time during the war, and started up again in 1943. The completion of this project was finished late in 1943, and the highway officially opened for traffic on November 20, 1943. After the completion of the highway, the soldiers and civilians began to travel along the road to Alaska, and it took them almost a month to complete this trek. Once the war was over, the Alaska Highway was given over to the American Highway Administration. Alaskan Highway is famous for a few places, one of which is Whitehorse.

(139 words)\nThe Longest Continents In The World (1)...\nThe longest mountain in the world is located in the Andes Mountains, which lie in South America. The Andes Mountains cover five South American countries. This mountain range starts in South America, and runs all the way through the continent; it is the longest mountain range in the world. It's maximum height is over 22,000 feet, and some of these mountain tops are as high as 22,834 feet. There are over thirty-five mountain tops that are over 21,000 feet. The Andes Mountain Range is the fourth longest mountain chain in the world, behind Himalayas, the Urals, and another mountain chain in South America. The Andes Mountains contain a lot of mountain range, and it is very cold. They are located very close to Chile, Argentina, Columbia, and Peru. There is not one mountain peak that is lower than over 9000 feet. This mountain range has over twenty volcanoes, one that is over 7000 feet high. It is a very dangerous place to be, and has the highest mountain peaks in the world. This mountain range has over 60 volcanoes in it, one of which is over 20,000 feet high. These volcanoes are erupting a lot, and are very unstable. The volcano Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 with an explosion that was 90,000 times more powerful than the one that happened on Mount Saint Helens, which was only a 185 foot increase in height. The Andes Mountains are famous for containing the longest mountain range in the world. They're famous because these are some of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. (224 words)\nTheres Long Distance Love\nThere's Long Distance Love \"I love you from the bottom of my heart.\" \"You're my boyfriend for life.\" \"We'll always be together\" \"We have forever and always\" I believe these to be true, because there is long distance love and a real true love. I am one of those people who love someone so so much that I cannot imagine it without them. My love is very true, but long distance is very cruel. There is a type of people who do it long distance. The first people of whom I think of when I hear the words \"long distance\" are military people and missionaries. I have two grandfathers. One went to the army during WW II and the other served in Vietnam as a missionary. Because of the distance between my grandfathers, my mom had to deal with it. She has always been a very patient person, as I can see. My grandma was the same way. But at times, they had their differences. Like there were two times they separated. My mom and dad divorced when I was around six months old. The rest of my life, I had to make new friends. I am always making friends and losing friends. The other time was when they were long distance love, for about a year. I had to adjust to a two-minute goodbye. This is something I think is terrible to have to do to someone. I know how much it hurts but I also know what it feels like to be in long distance love. When I was twelve, some friends and I took up skateboarding and rock climbing. The friends and I were all from very different backgrounds. As I learned about my friends, I discovered that one of the girls in school went from Australia to America to be with her boyfriend. I was curious and so I interviewed her. The boy she went to America for is the one that I am currently in long distance love with. I have a boyfriend here in California, where I live, and another one I am in long distance love with across the ocean in Australia. I am in one long distance love with one, and two of them are long distance love. I miss my parents like crazy and so I think that's why I love both of my long distance loves. Long Distance Love can be so hard to get through. My boyfriend, my dad, and I are not going to be separated for that long. I will be going to Australia this year and to see him. I cannot wait. As my boyfriend is moving to Australia, I am a very bittersweet way. I am both excited and extremely nervous. At times, I am happy while I am sad. I know that I will soon be with him and we will be together again. I will then be in long distance love with him, as I am now. Long Distance Love causes so many people to go through so many different feelings and that we can sometimes even lead to a lot of people do not in the world can handle them.

The different\nbags all cost the same price per pound, so the customers have no reason to select one potato bag over another. One of the five bags is a counterfeit; when the potato is cooked, it will cause serious health problems because a harmful bacteria has been added to the potato while it is still on the farm, and customers will not know that they have purchased a counterfeit bag of potato. The probability that a customer purchases a potato from a bag labeled as \u201corganic\u201d is 0.9; that a customer purchases a potato from a bag labeled as \u201ccertified\u201d is 0.8; and that a customer purchases a potato from a bag labeled as \u201cnatural\u201d is 0.7; the other two bags are labeled as \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cgrown on small family farms\u201d and the customer\u2019s confidence about the bag is about even with the other two. If the customer purchases one of the bags, the customer rolls a pair of dice and obtains the sum of faces showing. If the customer rolls 8 or less, the customer is informed how a potato looks similar to a regular potato. If the customer rolls 9 or more, the customer is informed how a harmful bacteria has been added to the potato. The customer would like to test a bag of potatoes with a 95% probability of choosing a regular potato. 12.\nSuggest a good procedure. Use a 100 sided die. Label each side 1 for a regular potato, 2 for a regular potato and a harmful bacteria, and 11 for a harmful bacteria. Have the customer first roll two dice. If the sum is less than or equal to 8, the customer picks a potato on the assumption it is a regular potato; otherwise, the customer picks a potato on the assumption it has a harmful bacteria. If a customer purchases a potato and discovers it is a counterfeit bag, then the customer is refunded the purchase price. 13. Suggest an improvement.\nDescribe four other ways to distinguish the potatoes.\nThis case study describes how an insurance company is using big data to predict risk.

Here are some good skills for starting a virtual assistant business from home.\nFor example, as you grow your email list, you can try a few paid advertising strategies to promote your opt-in page. With each email newsletter you send, you can use a Call-to-Action (CTA) button to encourage sign-ups to use your services.\nInvestors were also excited for the technology on display. For instance, the virtual booths by Samsung, Google, and Facebook made extensive use of camera tracking to give the illusion of interacting with the avatars and displays.\nSarah is a senior copywriter at Fit Small Business. She helps aspiring business owners find the right business financing products for their needs.\nReliable Internet Connection: If your connection is anything less than reliable, the video conferencing software will not work. An underpowered connection can also slow down the video and audio transmission, which may result in poor voice quality and dropped calls.\nBut before we dive in and learn about VR, it is important to know some facts about Virtual Reality and what it is. Virtual Reality (VR) is a 3D user experience that is created by computer and delivered to an end-user through a computer display or a VR head-mounted display (HMD). For the VR experience to be effective, a head-mounted display with a field of view of 90\u00b0 or higher, at least one sensor tracking the user's head movement and body posture, and VR software is needed. This software is what puts you into the virtual environment. With virtual reality experience, you interact with images, objects, sounds, and videos and live your experiences in a digitally created environment.\nVR headsets are similar to those devices used to play video games, but are much higher quality. They are also much more immersive, as the technology allows a user to look around at the various images. With this immersive experience, people can feel like they are \u201cin\u201d a different place, even though they are remaining in one spot. While the technology is available, few companies are using Virtual Reality headsets to their full potential because of the high expense of purchasing such technology.\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll first need to get a broad picture of the virtual reality industry, including where we are currently and where the industry is headed in the coming years.\nVR is about creating a virtual environment and putting yourself inside it. However, we don\u2019t yet have a working definition of exactly what that means. We\u2019re at a stage where the technology that allows you to put yourself into virtual experiences is largely immersion or simulation. Think of this for a moment: you put on a VR headset and now you are walking the streets of New York City. You don\u2019t know where this experience comes from. It\u2019s as if you stepped outside and took a picture of your surroundings. The same can be said of experiences in VR \u2013 you don\u2019t know what is going on. We simply put ourselves in a virtual reality experience without any knowledge of how it has been created nor what kind of technology is involved in creating such an experience.\nWe will know it\u2019s a virtual reality and not simply a head mounted display because we will be able to look around and move with our heads in this new space we have found for ourselves \u2013 just as if you were looking around your bedroom and then walking down the street there. Virtual Reality isn\u2019t just about creating immersive virtual environments \u2013 it\u2019s also about being able to interact with those environments in real time using your own hands or body parts, such as your fingers or shoulders. You have also probably seen advertisements for headsets like Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR that use positional tracking to tell where your head is in relation to what you see onscreen \u2013 this isn\u2019t just an option anymore \u2013 it\u2019s a standard feature built into all types of virtual reality headsets now. All of this means we are moving beyond mere entertainment into an entirely new kind of experience that would be impossible without using computer-generated imagery and video games technologies together in one device or platform.\nIn terms of content creation tools though, there\u2019s still a long way to go until anything resembling full blown 3D visualizations can be shown on 3D computers without some kind of headset (or goggles!). There\u2019s also a need for more robust motion data collection equipment such as cameras that keep track of where you are moving in space around your computer screen \u2013 and this equipment has been around for years now but has yet to break through into mainstream use because it\u2019s still too expensive for most consumers who just want something for leisure purposes without getting into any kind of business. There\u2019s also a need for improved computer hardware with better graphics processing power, as well as other devices such as keyboards and mice (although some virtual reality products can function well enough without them).\nFor the sake of the future, it\u2019s useful to note that there are ways to make VR headsets more affordable. A small company called Oreo is developing a cheap, high-resolution, all-in-one virtual reality headset with a display resolution of 4K per eye (2560 x 1440). The company expects a $200 headset will ship early next year for $99.\nThere are many ways you can promote your business through social media.

Drywell pressure - .257 Psi 25-27. If the pressure in that system is higher than a certain level or the pressure drops too low, a water hammer effect can occur. 25 gallons per minute. This is where the plumber should be working. 1 to 3 gal./min. and if the air in the tubes is lost it may require replacement. This is also called the deadleg. This can result in the well head floating on water and can cause problems if the pump cannot deliver enough flow. Some pumps have check valves to prevent this from happening. The DCP is also called the deadleg because this air acts like a blockage between the inlet and outlet to the pump. So if you have a pressure switch on your pump it may need to be replaced.\nA pressure switch is a switch that opens and closes a connection based on a set pressure. Pressure switches are designed to close or open at predetermined pressure levels. They may also come with adjustment screws with which to change the pressure level they will open at. This allows them to be set to different levels for different purposes or for different pressure sensors. Pressure switches can be used to ensure a certain pressure reading or pressure level in a system. Pressure switches are very versatile. They can be mounted directly to piping or indirectly by attaching through pressure piping. The main difference between a pressure switch and a pressure regulator is that a pressure regulator maintains the pressure, whereas a pressure switch only turns on at a certain pressure. Pressure switches often do a lot more than just measure the pressure. They can monitor the flow of liquid or gas through the piping and adjust the pressure and temperature of the system. They are also useful because they can be quickly reprogrammed in the field and require less setup than a pressure regulator. For more information, visit the website of a pressureswitch.com. A high level of water in your watering system may be the cause of the water hammer effect. Water heater pressure relievers. Pressure Relief \u2013 If your household water pressure is high and the water level in your water tank or reservoir is too low, then the water heater pressure relief valve will let any extra pressure out. The pressure relief valve acts as a pressure regulator. The pressure relief valve is a safety valve designed to open when it is too over pressurized. There are two main types of pressure relief devices: pressure relief valve(s), which control how much pressure is allowed in the system at one time, and emergency relief, which opens when the system is suddenly under-pressurized or is not pressurized at all. The high-pressure water tank relief valve will only operate with a water heater that has a pressure regulator and is not connected to the pressure relief line of a water supply system. The water heater is usually an above ground, high water-volume, 2 or 3 gallon tank that is filled to the top. It is usually under pressure, and if the piping is too small, it will break. The valve is used to reduce the number of high-pressure tanks, which results from filling the tank without a water inlet valve. The water heater pressure regulator, if it fails to open, will prevent the tank from being filled, or reduce the amount of water flow into the system. A pressure relief valve is a pressure regulator that can be used on a high pressure (HP) cylinder. Pressure relief valves are usually 5 gallons or less. Pressure relief valves are usually attached to a water tank or tank system in the pressure tank. Pressurized tanks are typically mounted on the ground, but they can also be mounted on a wall. A water pressure relief valve has two main purposes: to relieve excess pressure caused by a tank or tank that may be over-pressurized, and to limit how much water the tank can flow into the system before the air is released into the system. A pressure relief valve works very much like the pressure relief valve in a water heater.\nA high-pressure power system has been developed in an effort to address these issues. In essence, this high-pressure power system is a battery. The battery is attached to the main power supply at one end. It is connected to a low-pressure pump at the other end. The pump is powered by the battery's output. When its batteries' output is depleted, the pump stops working. With conventional systems, the pump can only operate for so long before it becomes inefficient and requires repair or replacement. The high-pressure power system overcomes this problem by replacing the pump with a battery-powered system that is connected to a very powerful source of electricity. This system is known as a high pressure generator. These systems are used in a number of applications in the electronics, medical, energy, and automotive industries. Many of these systems are now in use all over the world. The main advantage of a high-pressure generator is that it can produce electricity more quickly and efficiently. This has allowed a large number of applications to be developed in various fields. For example, high-pressure generators are now used in many industrial settings as a source of constant energy, which is usually the first step in the development of a new technology. Another benefit of high-pressure generators is that they allow us to use highly efficient electricity sources, which is one of the keys to developing new technologies.

This will help reduce the resistance to the application of high pressure. This kind of high-pressure system can then be used for many applications in industrial settings. An example is industrial settings including: Industrial applications The main task or application of an industrial application is usually to reduce the resistance presented by a high-pressure system. This can be achieved by using a variety of techniques including: by reducing the size of the high-pressure circuit by reducing the resistance of the high-pressure pump, by using materials-resistant materials and by using high-pressure valves, by using a hydraulic tank with a pressure gauge that is placed in a reservoir, by using a reservoir of oil that maintains a lower pressure, and by using an oil tank that maintains a higher-pressure level. Another important area of application of an industrial application is the use of highpressure systems for industrial processes. Here the pressure may be used for: a) production of a specific product, b) transporting materials, c) the production of various products, e etc. High-pressure systems for industrial purposes High-pressure systems are used for industrial applications to produce high-demand products, such as aerospace, automotive and agriculture. These high-pressure systems are typically used for: a) production of the product and for its delivery, bc) transportation of materials, cd and d) the transportation and handling of products such as machining machines, airplanes and railcars, etc. A high-pressure system can also be used as an alternative to a low-pressure (LPS) system, where the pressure is reduced to a lower level by reducing the pressure of the air in a high-resistance region of the hydraulic circuit. A high-pressure system can be used to provide a low-pressure pressure range for many applications, including: - Injection molding and injection molding machine manufacturing - Injection tool manufacturing - Injection device manufacturing and repair - Injection tool repair - Industrial processes using high-pressure systems An industrial application can be used for many applications, including: Industrial processes The industrial processes that use a high-pressure circuit are: Aerospace and Transportation Aerospace The aircraft and aircrafts are made from the parts that are used in the transportation industry such as airplanes, aircraft and spacecraft.\nApplication of High Pressure Systems in Industrial Settings. A high-pressure hydraulic system is a system that uses high-pressure pressure to increase the pressure of a given substance. These systems are used in industrial settings, especially for the production of water, air and steam (see also high-pressure steam). High pressure systems are used to produce a given quantity of a given product, usually for the production in industrial applications. For example, a gas system can be operated from a high pressure system to produce a quantity of gas. A water system can be operated to produce a quantity to produce water. A gas-based system can be operated to produce a quantity Water Pressure System A gas system, water pressure system, high pressure gas system. Water is generally used for a number of uses, including: Washing dishes and other household devices. Cooking food. Piping water for home use. Water systems that operate in industrial environments can be operated from this source. For example, an industrial water system operates from this source. Industrial Water System Water systems are used for many applications. Water-based systems are usually operated from water pressure systems. Water is used for many of these applications, including: Food preparation Water systems are often operated from water systems that operate in industrial applications. A water-water system operates from water-water systems. A waterbased system operates from Water pressure systems. Industrial applications of a water-based system include: Water is also used in industrial applications where there is a need for heat or a high level of humidity. For example, a steam system operates from the steam system.\nHydrolic power system\nThis article is not about Hydrolic power system. It is about high pressure systems. If you are looking for Hydroli Power System check out Hydroli Power System. Introduction A high-pressure high-pressure system is a high-speed, high pressure, power system that uses high-pressure air, oil or steam to produce high amounts of pressure. A high high-system has a pressure gauge that shows the pressure. The pressure gauge can also be used to measure the pressure of a product. History The Hydroli power system is a high speed, high pressure, power systems that are used for industrial applications such as power stations, power plants, power supplies, power transmission lines, power generation plants, power conversion plants and power generation facilities. Description A high speed, pressure power system uses a high pressure fluid in a high-power fluid loop to deliver power to the main power source. A high power fluid loop is used to extract the pressure of an air, oil or oil-based product from the fluid flow and deliver the fluid to a low pressure fluid tank. A low high-power fluid is a pressure fluid fluid loop containing both high pressure air and low pressure oil. The pressure is measured on the low side of the pressure gauge and is set to a level that varies according to the size of the low pressure loop and the pressure tank. This measure can be set by a human operator, by a machine or by a computer. A high-high-power fluid system consists of a pressure fluid flow loop containing high pressure and low pressure fluid tanks. High pressure fluid tanks store high-pressure air and high-speed oils, while low pressure flow loops store low pressure oil and other high-speed-oil fluids. High pressure and speed flow is used to generate an energy flow from high-energy high-temperature, high-power and low-power fluid tanks. A power transmission system can also use high pressure fluid flow loops to deliver power, or to deliver the energy to power stations. The pressure is set by a machine, by an operator or by a device that is capable of measuring pressure and is set using a mechanical device, a computer or computer-controlled controller.\nIs The DCP Power Switch For You?\nHow To Set Up A B&m Power Vacuum Part 1\nHow Power Vacuum And Blowers Can Help Build A Stronger Business", "num_tokens_generated": 3398, "OGF": 0.82958984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 83.15965843200684, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 749, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

You see the need for your product, and you build it. Yet, customers may not see the need for your product. You need to get user involvement early in development.\n\nFrom this comes the two main themes of your plan:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Use marketing techniques focused on user need and benefit in the product visioning and planning stages\n\\item Involve early customers in the product development process\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI could write a very long response about how to go about doing this, but I find that it is the most important part of the business plan, so I can only recommend that you also read \\em{Eating The Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete Against Brand Name Businesses} by Adam Morgan.\n\nComment: Great answer.

Also, explain how to determine the most appropriate lengthening cuts and the lengthening rate.\nThroughout the paper, it has attempted to explain how the data structure works point to point and through pseudocode. For the implementation of the stack, the stack class was created. The main method contains the code to create the stack and to push and pop from the stack. The push method accepts an element and inserts it into the end of the stack. The pop() method accepts a key and returns the key by removing it from the stack. For an empty stack, an Invalid element is returned. The class definition of Stack is given below, as well as, push and pop methods.\nThere are two methods defined for the stack-push to insert an element into the stack and pop to remove one from the stack. The push() and pop() methods are given below, as well as their main method call.\npublic void push(long element) {\n// add this element to this end\nstack[stac_size++] = element;\nSystem.out.println(\"Invalid element\");\npublic long pop(long stac_key) {\nfor (int stac_size =0; stac_size<stac_size; stac_size++ ) {\nif ( stac_key ==\nstack[stac_size] ) /* Remove index */\nreturn stac_key;\nreturn invalid;\nIn the implementation above, the number 14 is pushed to the stack and the number 2 is popped from the stack. The result is shown below:\nThere are some assumptions that needs to be taken into consideration while comparing the data structure in this assignment between the two methods of the stack. The first assumption is that the stack is completely empty before the call push in the main method. The second assumption is that the order of the stack in ascending order. Also, the pop() method requires a key to be passed in. Another assumption is that in push() method, the stack is never negative. If the key is passed as invalid and the method is called, the program must display an exception.\nJava Programming Assignment Help, Homework Help Service\nJava is a high-level, object-oriented, and class-based programming language that is widely used in developing applications for the cloud, mobile, desktop, and enterprise environments. Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle); and it is open-source and also available from Oracle for commercial licensing. Java Programming Assistant can produce software for desktop and mobile devices as well as micro controllers and games. This is an application-level programing language.\nSoftware in the Java programming language has a number of important features. One significant characteristic of Java programs is that they are compact and they consume low memory space. Java was developed with an idea of being platform independent hence, Java applications can also be executed on all OS and hardware environments without having to get recompiled.\nThis is the biggest reason why most organization is still using Java Language to write programs. The syntax of Java program is simpler than most of the other languages. This is one of the primary reasons behind which Java Assignment Help is highly in demand for the help seeking students.\nJava Programming Assignments help by Programming Homework Help provides students complete assignment help by online tutors.

The input would be that you tell it the upper and lower bound of the search. The output should be all of the possible answers. (The output should be each of the 25 answers. A 2-digit number could be 1. (Say you have a 1000 by 1000 grid with random numbers from 1 to 100. When reading from a text file I want the lines to be delimited by the space symbol in the text file.2. Write a Matlab program that prints all of the possible 6-digit numbers if you add 1 to each of the 3-digit numbers that will be in the range. The output of this algorithm should be one of the strings to write to the text files. Example: The file would contain: 13.\nWrite an algorithm that can take two numbers as input and add them together. the end. Example: The input to the function should be a string in the format in the above example. I want you to write several. The function should return the value of the remainder. (For example: If x and y are 7 and 5 then this should be called with 7 as x and 5 as y.2-9) Write an algorithm and the code to print all of the lines in a text file that have the letters \u201cabc\u201d in the file? (For example: \u201cabc\u201d is in line 2 and 5. Use what you learned in the past few weeks to come up with a solution. The output should be an array where each element is of the form c(line_number c line). The end goal of this program should be to be able to change the input string to a new string by using your algorithm.2-2) Write an algorithm and the code that will print the lines of a text file that contain odd numbers? (For example: The following is in the file: 1087 4 42655 1245318879140 1597480 8766534 26.) . Write a program where the user enters two integers.1. The end goal of this program should be to be able to change the string to a new string by using your algorithm.2-8) Write an algorithm to determine if a number is a prime number.2-4) Write an algorithm that will swap the last two elements in a given array.3-1) Write an algorithm to determine if a number is a factor of another number.\n(That means we are not doing your assignment for you. Use the code below as something to build off of to write your own assignment solver. and if it is there do nothing).2-5 Exercise 0 (Repeat Questions 1 and 2 for Matrices) Find an algorithm to determine if a text file has at least 1 character in it. You can also get help if needed but try to figure it out on your own as well.2-6 Write an algorithm that will read in a text file and return the number of lines that contain a substring \u201cabcdef\u201d in the lines.2-3) What is the shortest possible length of an algorithm to determine if a given string contains the substring \u201cabc\u201d? (The goal of a short algorithm is that only the essentials are included in the algorithm.

In computer science, a stack is a data structure that provides last-in, first-out (LIFO) storage. It is the model of computation where a machine can only operate one instruction at a time. In computer science, the stack is a LIFO stack that stores data in last-in, first-out order. A computer's stack typically also contains return address storage, which is used to return instructions to previous instructions at entry points such as function calls. Stacks also store local variables when they are on the stack frame of a procedure. In computer science, the queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure, which means that the first element added to a queue is the one removed next.

A. T. 0. study by the Meteorological Office and other authorities. The fog was considered to be produced by cold air lying over warm relatively dry moist air which, rising up to meet the cold air, was made visible by condensed water vapour, which produced the fog. The fog did not rise above 800 ft. and was quite transparent. The conditions when measured ranged from -5C to zero up to 45C, the fog clearing about midday. The conditions during the study were those in which the maximum humidity was found to be of the nature of maximum dew point. The fog had a general appearance of a thick and heavy blanket about 200 to 300 yards thick. However, in certain locations of the field conditions were a little different; some areas were clear while others were heavily foggy. The heavy fog area was situated just to the North of the Western field and also about 300 yards South of the Eastern one. The other fog area extended over a large portion of the Southern fields, some of which were completely cut off from the rest of the track. As already stated, the fog was quite dense with visibility at times not exceeding 75 ft. For a given area the fog was not steady but was quite violent; in one case a clear hole was followed after a short time by a strong fog. In other places a light fog gave place to a dense fog which disappeared completely. The fog, as stated, had two areas of different quality; one was much hotter and generally the moisture content was lower. It was therefore to be of low dew point and as the dew point is proportional to the mean density of the air, so is the mean density which in this case would be high. The other area was slightly higher in dew point and therefore slightly lower in mean density than the Northern one. As shown in the following illustration, the temperature in degrees C, and dew point in the following order were arranged over this section and in this order: -5 degrees to 0 degrees C, 0 to 3 degrees C, 3 degrees to 4 degrees C, 4 degrees to 5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 5 degrees to 6 degrees C, -5 degrees C, 0 degrees to 3 degrees C, 3 degrees to 4 degrees C. Although the fog was not rising above 800 ft., its position was usually higher with respect to the level of the runway, as the following diagram shows. The fog area was usually very patchy though there were certain local conditions that made it very diffuse. The location as a rule was very patchy from the North boundary to the East boundary of the field where the mean cloud base was about 2,000 ft. and at no point exceeding 2,500 ft. The following diagram shows the general outline of the foggy sky. As will be shown in the following description, the foggy sky was caused by condensation of water vapour when the cold air (air in this case with dew point 6 C) met the warm air (air in this case with dew point 6 C). The formation of the vertical column of a fog patch was the result of a combination of horizontal and vertical movement of the air, but this process could have been understood by first considering only the horizontal movement. When the boundary layer is present it is more likely that vertical moisture motion will take place than horizontal moisture motion. The following description makes use of the equation for heat conduction dTdt 1/d2 = dP/d3P and assumes the steady state condition where T is the temperature with respect to height and d3P is the density variation with height. If the air is assumed horizontally isothermic over the area to be considered, an air bubble (dome) will be formed at a certain height with respect to the height from which the air was lifted to meet the colder air. The vertical motion will move upward into the bubble and will be pushed upward by the increased surface tension in this bubble, while the warmer drier air will continue to fall back into it. The surface tension in this bubble will increase as a result of the adsorption of the moisture present on the surface. In this way the horizontal component of the flow is lost. The vertical moisture flows from the warmer less dense part to the colder more dense one and the surface tension is increased with consequent expansion of the lower part of the bubble and the upper part to be compressed. This process will continue until a state of equilibrium is reached in which the vertical moisture flow exactly balances the downward flow of the warm air. The following equation can be applied for finding the equilibrium in the same way dTdt 1/d3T = dP/d3T or dT2dt = dP/d3T. Considering the density variation with height d3T = 75T then dT2dt = dP/75T and dT = dTmin =dTmin/75T which is easily solved. The dome is therefore caused by the vertical moisture motion which is governed by the horizontal velocity and by the temperature difference, as will be shown later. With respect to the above solution, dP/d3T = = = = The above solution describes a vertical column of a bubble of air. The height of the bubble is therefore given by (10) 2 + (Tmin - T) (10) ( )= (10) Thus the equilibrium is reached when ( ) 75 = (10) ( ) 75 = + Tmin (11) and ( ) 75 -( )(Tmin - T) = (12) Thus (Tmin - T) 24 (13) As the equilibrium is reached when ( ), 75 = (14) 75 = (Tmax-T) (14) and 25 - (Tmax-T) = (15) Thus (Tmax - T) = -5 If the air is assumed horizontally isothermic over the area to be considered, an air bubble is formed at a certain velocity with respect to the level from which the air is lifted to meet the colder air. The vertical motion will push upward the warm moist air into it. The same process as in the case of a horizontal motion will take place, but here the moisture adsorption will be less than in the case of a horizontal motion as a consequence of the slower movement of the air. However, the vertical air motions will take place also in a stable air layer as the warmer less dense air will be pushed upward by the surface tension forces; the down moving air in this case will have a higher velocity than the surface relative to the surface. The same argument than for the horizontal component of the velocity can be applied to the vertical component of the air velocity at the boundary layer. It is evident that in the case of the air motion and in the case of the water vapour movement, the latter one has a smaller velocity component than the former one. The following figure, which has the same geometry as the former one, illustrates this point. The air is lifted from two points. The lower one has 0 C and a level of 50 ft. whereas the temperature at the upper one is 5 C and the height is 90 ft. The point at which these two air layers meet is 45 ft. high. The following table shows the velocity relations at the different points of the system. Position (C-1) = the average of the two temperatures with the air velocity being the average of the heights of the surface. It is evident that the water vapour will increase when the relative humidity is increased with respect to the air of the same temperature. The air temperature in this case has a great influence on the relative humidity, as the following figures illustrate. For the following figures in this case the air is cool enough for condensation; -10 C, 0 C, 5 C, 20 C, and 25 C. The same relation applies to dry air at temperatures of 25 C, 30 C, and 35 C. The humidity curve at low temperatures is generally of the shape of a bell shape, whereas the humidity curve at a high temperature is generally a straight line over a certain percentage of relative humidity, and is therefore considered to be of the maximum dew point nature. This will also be shown later through an analysis of the fog development. From this analysis it follows that the air temperature of 5 C, which is close to the dew point (6 degrees), will show fog conditions, whereas the air temperature of 20 C will not. Moreover, the fog will be the most pronounced when the relative humidity is the highest, i.e. near the dew point. Moreover, all these fog conditions have very high dew points relative to the ambient air and to the dew points of the moisture content of the atmosphere. Hence, there is a clear case here for a condensation fog under freezing cloud formation conditions. This is in fact what happened at Cholsey. Further investigation of the air conditions was made during the study and in particular the effect of humidity on the boundary layer was made and it was found that the humidity in this case had an effect of the boundary layer and of the surface conditions. Dew point was therefore an important factor when the air temperature was low. The above analysis was based on data from the Met. Office but from its experience Cholsey could, of course, make an estimate in cases where data was unavailable that the fog condition would appear. When considering data collected at other locations and from previous fog studies, the following points were also made. When considering only air humidity this will not be a very valuable method of predicting the fog conditions because it has been shown that the humidity of the air has little effect on the formation of the boundary layer, and hence the formation of the fog when the relative humidity is fairly constant. However, from experience, fog has been seen when the humidity of the air has been above 75 percent, but still, this will have little influence on the fog formation rate. The following table gives relations for temperatures and relative humidity which will enable one to understand and to predict fog conditions at Cholsey.\n26 12 L I G H T I N G 5 The following figures, which can be compared with the first case, illustrates the fog conditions. Figure 11 (left) illustrates the relative humidity with respect to temperature; in this case a foggy sky is seen as the maximum dew point is reached first in the day when the temperature is about 0 degrees. Also, this means that the foggy conditions are most pronounced from early in the morning throughout the day; it is then possible to have foggy conditions even when the relative humidity is very low. Figure 11 (right) illustrates the time of occurrence of foggy conditions, and here it should be noted that fog can occur well into the night in case of very high clouds or in very humid air conditions. Table 1.\n27 12 L I G H T I N G 6 The following table illustrates certain fog conditions from the preceding figures. In all cases the relative humidity is very low and the fog occurs very late in the day. The foggy conditions last for most of the day with only slight increase during the hours between 6 and 18 o clock. 14 L I G H T I N G 7 Figure 8 above illustrates the air temperature profile between 15 th April 1956 and 25 th May 1956. In this case the foggy conditions could be predicted because the air temperature dropped below freezing in the night from about 20 minutes before sunrise to about an hour before sunrise. When conditions are cold enough then the fog could occur and last for most of the day, in this case it lasted from early in the morning until well into the night. When the weather conditions are such that no fog conditions are expected it is more difficult to predict whether there will be fog or not, but this can be made by the analysis made in this part. If we take a case where the air will be cold enough for the fog to form, then we can make an estimate of when fog will occur. The air was assumed to drop below freezing in the night by the boundary layer, but in some cases, the ambient air may be as cold as 0 degrees in Cholsey. This is a situation where one considers that a certain percentage of the ambient air will have a dew point of freezing, which will have a higher temperature than the colder air in the boundary layer. In this case fog will be formed as the cold air is warmer, since the boundary layer is present and causes cooling of the boundary air. When this happens the clouds will show a lower temperature than the surface temperature. The fog will therefore occur very early in the morning, and may last all through the morning and into the afternoon. Figure 15 (left) illustrates the relative humidity during a night when the surface temperature increases, in this case the temperature during the night is about to show an increase during the day, when the relative humidity is high. It will then be possible for a foggy condition to occur. Figure 15 (right) illustrates the relative humidity during the day when the clouds in the boundary layer form and show a temperature that is cooler than the ambient air temperature. In these cases, the foggy conditions will be very pronounced, and will show a high relative humidity, as the fog will form from these conditions when the ambient air condition is high. The foggy conditions will therefore be last for most of the day. 20 L I G H T I N G 8 Figure 9 (left) shows the relative humidity between 13 th May 1956 and 29 th May 1956. In this example the relative humidity is low and foggy conditions will therefore be very low, but it is seen that the foggy conditions could actually occur in this case. Figure 9 (right) shows the relative humidity during the night on 21 th May. The foggy condition occurs later during the day. It would be interesting to see what the fog conditions will be, and it will be found that fog will take place between 12.00 and 14.00 hrs. 25 L I G H T I N G\n28 12 L I G H T I N G 9 Figure 10 (left) illustrates foggy conditions, and here it can be clearly seen that fog conditions are pronounced late at night and early in the morning. Figure 10 (right) illustrates daytime conditions and these could also be pronounced in cases of foggy conditions, but this is not as pronounced as the night conditions. Daytime foggy conditions can last from early morning to late afternoon or evening. This could also be seen with the data. Figure 11 (left) illustrates foggy conditions during the night as the foggy conditions can last for long periods. Figure 11 (right) illustrates daytime foggy conditions and the time when the fog is most pronounced, i.e. early in the morning between about 6 and 7.30 o clock. This is where the fog was most pronounced at Cholsey. The foggy conditions of this case occur between 8 o clock and 9 o clock. In this case, the foggy conditions lasted until noon. It is not the purpose of this dissertation to analyse or to predict foggy conditions in this area in this way; the aim has been only to analyse and to predict this in a more general way as well as to investigate whether any particular areas were found where foggy conditions were more pronounced. The analysis shows clearly that at Cholsey any fog conditions would occur in the early morning, and could only occur then. As fog may be in the form of the freezing layer, it was considered that there are specific conditions for each type of fog. For the case of the following diagrams it could be concluded that the dew point of freezing will have the effect of the fog formation conditions. It depends on the temperature in the cloud base or around the surface of Cholsey. The fog formed very slowly but this is common for the freeze fog. Also seen is that the fog did not form under very heavy clouds, and the reason for this is that the surface humidity will be low when the clouds are present. The following case shows that the fog formation would not take place at all times, even when a dew point of freezing is reached. When there was a cloud base temperature of for instance 3 degrees C, this would cause ice to form in the cloud base. If the cloud base temperature was high enough to form the ice, i.e. above 4 degrees C, the formation of the fog will be slow. When the air temperature is high as in the following case, the foggy conditions will not be pronounced, and could only be very pronounced late in the day. These cases may be considered as a special type of foggy conditions. 26 L I G H T I N G 10 Figure 12 (left) shows that a temperature as low as 34 degrees C is too high for fog formation. It does not mean that fog will never appear at Cholsey when all the conditions are below the freezing point, the freezing fog would occur more pronounced in this case than with a low temperature of for instance 3 degrees C. Figure 12 (right) illustrates that fog formation will occur if the cloud base is high enough, if there is some moisture in the air, and if the surface temperature is high enough. Fog would then be formed and if the fog developed it would be clear that the fog will develop into the morning and early afternoon and clearing conditions would then develop, with no sign of fog, and the temperature increasing in the boundary layer. 27 L I G H T I N G\n29 12 L I G H T I N G 11 In the case of the following graph there is no dew point of freezing present, but one can see that the minimum temperature during the night is below freezing. As the following graph shows there were instances of this kind when fog was formed without a dew point of freezing present. In these cases the fog may be formed from dew points above 89% R. One might speculate that the fog formation would occur if the moisture would be. However, during the day as shown in the the above, fog would occur. 15: 0 and 5: and conditions.

The selection sort algorithm takes an array of N integers, repeatedly finds the minimum element until that minimum element is found, then swaps the minimum element with the element preceding it in the array.It is a comparison sorting algorithm and does not work well on unsorted arrays. This tutorial describes six most important sorting algorithms, namely, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Sorting & Searching Algorithms in C++. If someone wants to do it in C++ then just search for \"C++ bubble sort\" or \"C++ merge sort\" or any sorting algorithm you want to sort an array of size N. Also, try different implementations to come up with one of your choices. Array is the data structure consisting of multiple variables in memory. Bubble Sorting (Average/worst case time complexity O(n 2)) - Given an array of integers, the task is to sort the given array by changing the order of the elements in the array: We have to iterate the given array and put those array elements in correct order. 8. You should use the big-O notation, and provide the formula for the worst case scenario of each algorithm. For example, if you need to sort a list of names by last name and first name, a nested function sort could make it easier. 5.3. There is no comparison between the two. 8.1 Bubble Sort. A simple sort function is used for sorting array in C program using function or recursive procedure. 8. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the student to these different data structures and sort algorithms using the C programming language. 4. What you need to know: Write a bubble-sort algorithm that sorts a list of characters by printing each character when it reaches the desired position; Use the sort() method to sort an array of numbers.

Sorting algorithms. 8.1 Bubble Sort. Arrays . In this chapter we discuss the algorithms for sorting an array and discuss their space and time complexity. If you can implement sorting algo\u2026 4. It uses the array parameter first to hold the initial state. Using this formula, you can get the answer of how much time it will take in worst case scenario to execute the algorithm . Compare and contrast some common sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. 4. 7.3 Shell Sort. 1. Algorithm is made up of a sequence of simple instructions to solve a specific problem. 6.2 Quick Sort . Merge Sort. Example: Sort an array of numbers or strings in ascending or descending order. Selection Sort. 2. 9. In the bubble sort algorithm, the element with the smallest value is inserted at the beginning of each row and the element with the largest value is inserted at the end of each row. To understand the time and space complexities of Quicksort and comparison based sorting algorithms. Merging is done using the merge procedure as discussed earlier. Sort Algorithms in C++ for Arrays of Integers The following program implements simple linear sort algorithms in C++ to sort an array of integers. Sorting Algorithms in C++ 1. Algorithms are usually implemented as recursive procedures. This simple algorithm is known as selection sort . The book is written by Herbert Schildt and published by McGraw-Hill Education. 12.842 Sorting and Searching in Computer and Communication Networks C++ Sorting Algorithm A sorting algorithm is an iterative procedure to insert elements of a list into increasing or decreasing order. It is a comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts an array in ascending and descending order. To summarize, here is a quick recap of each topic: A sorting algorithm is an iterative procedure to insert elements of a list into increasing or decreasing order. You should be able to explain how to create an efficient algorithm and describe the time and space complexities of different algorithms. For each item in the list, compares it to the position in the list and if the item is greater, it puts it at the end of the list, otherwise, it places it at the beginning. Sorting and Searching Algorithms in C++ 1071 Algorithms \u2022 Algorithms in computer science are procedures, or lists of steps, to solve a computational problem. This algorithm works on an array of numbers or characters.

What You Need to Know Bubble Sort A naive sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through a list, comparing each element with the rest of the list until they are in the correct order. What You Need to Know. The C++ Standard Library provides many sorting algorithms and functions as tools for the developer. Algorithms. To understand the various sorting algorithms and the time and space complexities of Quicksort and comparison based sorting algorithms. The selection sort algorithm takes an array of N integers, repeatedly finds the minimum element until that minimum element is found, then swaps the minimum element with the element preceding it in the array.It is a comparison sorting algorithm and does not work well on unsorted arrays. Bubble sort (C) - Write a C program to implement bubble sort algorithm for sorting a list of numbers in ascending or descending order. In a bubble-sort, the unsorted array is first divided into two sorted parts, and the rest of the elements in the sorted part are considered, whereas the remaining elements are placed in a new array. Merge Sort. It uses the array parameter first to hold the initial state. He explains what algorithm is, why it is important and how they use them in software. Algorithms in C++. In sorting algorithm, the goal is to group the elements in increasing or decreasing order. 5. Sorting Algorithms in C++ (Bubble Sort) (Bubble Sort) (Bubble Sort) Program 5.1. Selection Sort.

Is there a list of good and bad examples that you can share for me to start with? For example, for image generation, you could use generative adversarial networks (GANs) with supervised learning, or you could build a system for image captioning with a sequence to sequence ( Seq2Seq ) model and supervised learning. The model has a pretrained language model but you need to retrain for the task you want to do. To teach a GPT-2 style language model you should use the pretrained model on whatever task/dataset you want to use and then fine tune the model on that task.

These are very strong models and will be used for various NLP and ML tasks. I would like to start by recommending the following to you in your journey towards understanding and implementing GPT-2: https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/GPT2.html, https://blog.openai.com/building-gpt-2/commentary, https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2/, https://github.com/openai/gpt-2, https://github.com/openai/gpt-2_slope_175m, https://blog.openai.com/architecture-of-gpt-2/. For example, you could build a chatbot to assist users of your app/website, or an AI-powered assistant to respond to customer chats as part of your customer service. Can we train a GPT-2 style neural network from scratch (i.e without pre-trained, public models)? These are very strong models and will be used for various NLP and ML tasks. We\u2019ve already seen how you can train a simple GPT-2 language model based on text input on the AI Classroom, if you want to check that out. How can I train a LLM using RLHF methods based on InstructGPT to create a human assistant that exceeds open assistant in it's performance, accuracy, and utility? r long GPT2 also has a pretrained language model, but you need to re-train it on the data you want to use for the task. You can do this using the transformers API. Here is the link to the Tutorial of how to use this API: https://dev.to/tiket/how-to-get-your-own-gpt-instantly-and-for-free-1j80. The model can work with a variety of inputs i.e the model does not have inbuilt biases and the model is aware of the context.

GPT-3 is already available to the public and it is very popular. LLMs trained from scratch tend to be more effective when the language model is trained from images or videos or audio data. The model can be trained from scratch as it does not have an inbuilt bias and the model is aware of context. All you have to do is to build a training set for the model to learn from and then train it on that (or use some other premade dataset). How would you be able to use transfer learning to make your model better? GPT-J is an implementation of GPT-3.5 with the best accuracy to date on GPT-3.5 validation set on a single machine. The model can work with a variety of inputs i.e the model does not have inbuilt biases and the model is aware of the context.\nIt is a good question I suppose, but at the same time the answer is very subjective, depending on how you define \u2018high\u2019; it should be clear that the model is capable of understanding the input and producing an output.

The missing value in an array can tell how the values are sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nvar str1 = 'cat',\n    str2 = 'dog,cat,cats,rat,mouse';\nconsole.log(findFirstIndexOrLastIndex(str1, str2)); //cat\nconsole.log(findFirstIndexOrLastIndexReverse(str1, str2)); //mouse\n```\n\n### Find the First and Last Occurrences of a String in a List of Strings\n\n**Function**\n\n```javascript\nvar findIndex= function(arr, needle) {\n// find first occurances\nreturn arr.reduce(function(a, b) {\n    if (b === needle) return b;\n    return a;\n}, -1);\n};\n\nvar findIndexReverse= function(arr, needle, i) {\n// find last occurences\nreturn arr.slice(0,i).find(function(b){\n    if (b === needle) return b;\n    return false;\n});\n};  \n```\nFind the first and last occurrences of a specified string in a list of strings.

First parameter indicates where we starting with counting sequence and second parameter indicates the end.\nExample:\n\n```javascript\narr = ['dog', 'cat', 'cats', 'rat', 'mouse', 'dog', 'cat', 'cats', 'rat', 'dog'];\n\nlet index = 1\nvar found = findIndexReverse(arr, 'cat', index); // 4\nconsole.log(found); //[4];\n```\n\n###### code for questions 31-40\n```javascript\n// function\nvar arr = [ 'dog', 'rat', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'cats' ],\n    needle = 'cat',\n    firstIndex = 1,\n    lastIndex = 9,\n    middleValue = 4;\nconsole.log(\"--before--\");\n\nvar index = findIndex(arr, needle);\nconsole.log(\"--after--\");\nconsole.log(index + \", \" + firstIndex + \", \" + lastIndex);\n\nif (index === -1) {\n    return 'Not found...';\n}\n\nelse {\n    console.log('Found at ' + (index + firstIndex) +\", last index is at \"+ (index + lastIndex));\n}\n```\nThe goal is to find index (firstIndex()) , middle value (middleValue()) and last index (lastIndex()) of needle in arr and display values for first, middle and last index in order. Then it should return the value which indicates that item is found if the item is found.\n\nExample:\n```\nvar arr = [ 'dog', 'cats', 'dog', 'cats', 'dog', 'cats', 'dog' ];\n\nvar needlen = 'cat';\nvar firstIndex = 7;\nvar lastIndex = 14;\nvar middleIndex = 8;\n \nvar index = findIndex(arr, needlen);\nconsole.log(index + \", \" + firstIndex + \", \" + lastIndex);\n```\n", "num_tokens_generated": 2115, "OGF": 0.516357421875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 49.84482955932617, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 766, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

DEDUCTIVE LOGIC If we are presented with specific premises, we can then reason deductively to a specific conclusion.\n4 Ex. 1. All children are human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, all children are mortal. The conclusion \"Mortal\" is valid only if the premises are correct. 5 PREFERENCES OF STUDENTS HAVE CHANGED, AND FACILITATORS BETTER MOVE STUDENTS AWAY FROM \"MEN SHOULDN TAKE ARTS CLASS\".\n5 EXAMPLE 2 Ex. 2. 2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 2 + 5 = 2 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 4 + 8 = 5 + 7 = 5 + 9 = 5 + 11 = 7 + 8 = 7 + 9 = 6 + 7 = 5 + 10 = 6 + 11 = 4 + 12 = 4 + 13 = 3 + 13 = 4 + 14 = 1 + 15 = 1 + 17 = 2 + 18 = 3 + 19 = 4 + 20 = 4 DEDUCTIVE REASONING AND INDUCTIVE REASONING DEDUCTIVE and INDUCTIVE REASONING refer to two different methods of building a logical argument. Deductive reasoning moves from specific premises to specific conclusions. Inductive reasoning moves from general premises to specific conclusions. Deductive reasoning is also known as \"deductive logic\" or \"inductive argumentation\". Ex 3. The premises are:\n6 CON 21 20/07/2013 22:06:16 RED WE NDS ON THE PRO S AN G E A S THAT O N E B RI N G S IN H E FE D B A C K FUTURE EDUC ATI ON IN THOE RD WORLD PART I CON 2: GLA A PE SE L T A IN C LA S F F TS Y C H A C T E R A P R C 3. The fallacy of insufficient evidence or insufficient data exists when an argument that attempts to make a claim about reality, an event, or a phenomenon is presented without sufficient evidence for the claim. There may be enough evidence for the claim to be true, but then the claim becomes an inductive argument, and not a deductive one at all. Ex 4. The premises are: 6 PREFERENCES OF STUDENTS CHA NGED, AND FAL LA ARE D ES C R I B I N G F AC I LITATORS M OVE STUDENTS AWAY FROM RULES TO F E E D B A C K.\n7 I. A certain town has had a major decrease in crime over the past couple of years. II. The rate of unemployment has dropped in this particular town over the past few months. III. The public school system is doing a good job of teaching reading and math. In the last example given above, the first argument is deductively valid if and only if the premises are true. But the conclusion \"The school system is doing a good job\" would not have deducibility if the second premise were false or even if true but not sufficient to justify the conclusion.\n8 There is no deductive logical fallacy in the argument, but the truth-value of II and III does not give us the same information regarding the conclusion. Therefore, this is an inductive argument Ex. 5. I. The number of pesticides applied to the farm has gone down over the past years. II. More pesticide residues are being found on the foods grown therein. III. The quality of the food grown at this farm has declined significantly. An argument is deductively valid if and only if the premises are true (or at least sufficient for the truth of the conclusion) and the argument does not contain the deductive fallacies. A strong inductive argument is an argument that is true when and only when the premises are true. However, a deductively valid argument need not be a strong inducible argument, as illustrated in Ex. 7. 8 L E S S ON 8: INFER RING FRO M INCID ENT AS FEEDBAC K FUTURE EDUC ATI ON IN TH E REAL WORLD PART I DIALOGICAL ARGUMENTS EX. 6. I. Many of the students who take philosophy classes have trouble learning Latin I. Many of the students who take Spanish classes have trouble learning Latin II. Many of the students who take math classes have trouble learning Greek III. The students who have trouble learning Latin are not succeeding in their classes The dialogical argument above provides a \"reason\" based on three premises to arrive at a conclusion. Although deductively valid on the basis of the premises, the overall argument is a weak inductive argument. However, if we added the premise \"All students who have trouble learning one foreign language will have trouble learning any foreign language\", the argument becomes strong. 8\n9 EXA M PL E 7 Ex. 7. I. Weed and fertilizer have been applied to the farm. II. Insect damage has been controlled in the crops on the farm. III. The crop yields and quality have increased during the last several years. Deductively, the last argument is valid if all of the premises are true. However, the argument contains the fallacy of affirming the conclusion. 9 PREFERENCES OF STUDENTS HAVE CHANGED, AND FALLARE DESCRIBING F A C I L I TATORS MOVE STUDENTS AWAY M OVE AWAY FROM RULES T ELL FACULTY.\n10 A fallacy of affirming the conclusion is a deductively valid argument with a true conclusion which is obtained by accepting all of the premises, even though not all of the premises are true or not sufficient to justify acceptance of the conclusion (i.e. not sufficient to provide \"good reasons\"). Ex. 8. \"All children must learn the Spanish language to prepare themselves as adults for living and working in a Spanish speaking society. We are teaching Spanish now. All the children will learn Spanish by the time they finish our instructional program.\" (The speaker believes all children should learn Spanish, whether the child plans to move to a Spanish speaking country or not.) Deductive fallacies of affirming the conclusion include: The assumption of falsity fallacy: A. Falsity is assumed: Socrates is tall. Conclusion: Socrates is not tall. A strong induction argument is an argument with true premises and true conclusion, and a weak induction argument is one which has true premises but is false in its conclusion. The problem with deductive reasoning is that many of the arguments in everyday life may not be valid. However, in deductive reasoning, when the argument is valid the conclusion is logically required and correct (assuming that the premises are correct). \"Deductively speaking, there is no reason to assume all of these ideas to be true. In fact, there are good reasons to assume them to be false. For example, if we assume the validity of the argument, we ought to conclude that a pizza is a beer. Or that an airplane is a horse. Or that the President of the United States is one of the following: an ex-governor of Illinois, a resident of the planet Tatooine, or a humanoid from a distant planet (and that last option would hardly be a good thing).\" 9 CON.\n11 21 20/07/2013 22:14:04 RED WE NDS ON THE PRO S AN G E A S THAT O N E B RI N G S IN H E FE D B A C K FUTURE EDUC ATI ON IN THOE RD WORLD PART I CON. 3: MULTI - L EVEL OU T COME .

Many of the students who took the Latin class passed the advanced Latin proficiency course at the level of I have trouble learning Latin, I can t spell Latin words, and I have trouble writing in Latin. EX A M P L E\n12 II. If students passed the course, many students who did not take the Latin class could pass the advanced class at the level of I have trouble learning Latin at the advanced level II. I have trouble learning Latin at the advanced level III. I have trouble learning Latin at the advanced level Some will argue that the previous argument does not provide enough information for the conclusion to be acceptable. This is a good point. Although it is valid, our acceptance of the conclusion requires some form of logical reasoning, which has yet to be provided. We can provide a better logical justification of this argument by providing new premises. In our example, the premise \"Many of the students who took the class passed the advanced Latin proficiency course at the level of I have trouble learning Latin at the advanced level\" would provide further information about the conclusion which might be more likely to convince. But there is no deductive fallacy in this inductive argument. Ex. 10. I. The first grade students who have trouble in grammar class will have trouble in science class II. The students who have trouble in art class will have trouble in music class III. The third grade students who have trouble in music class will have trouble in language arts class IV. I will teach you all that you need to know for both science and language arts, by the end of the school year, if you are committed to doing so. This argument above has the fallacy of affirming the conclusion. 12 CON.\n13 A fallacy of affirming the conclusion is a deductively valid argument with a true conclusion which is obtained by accepting all of the premises, even though not all of the premises are true or are not sufficient to justify acceptance of the conclusion (\"There is no deductive logical fallacy in the argument, but the truth-value of II and III does not give us the same information regarding the conclusion.\"). We may accept this argument as true if we believe our premises are true, but there is something lacking in the reasoning presented by the premises. The deductive fallacy is that the truth of the conclusion can be \"affirmed\" only by having all of the premises being true, but if one of the premises is false then deducing the truth of that conclusion from those premises will yield a deductively valid conclusion. The only conclusion that can be validly derived from the premises offered in this argument is that: If the students can not learn both science and language arts, then we know that the teacher will teach them both, in the same way, by the end of the year (assuming all of the premises are true). 13 CON.\n14 CON. 4: LET T HEC U ST O D F A L L AC ES.

I will teach you all that you need to know for all of the above standards, by the end of the school year, if you are committed to doing so. (John) The new state standards require more instruction and time in the curriculum, so this may not be a realistic premise. This argument above has the fallacy of affirming the conclusion. Some will argue that the previous argument does not provide enough information for the conclusion to be acceptable. This is a good point. Although it is valid, there is a deductive fallacy in the argument. We can provide a better logical justification of this argument by providing new premises. In our example, the premise \"The requirements for acceptance have more than doubled\" would provide further information about the conclusion which might be more likely to convince. There is no deductive fallacy in this inductive argument. 14 CON.\n16 CON. 5: THE PRO GRAMS TH A H AVE L E SS E VALUAT E S.

State standards can be more rigorous and will improve student achievement. III. By understanding and mastering the standards by the end of the school year, students will be on grade level for high school graduation and entrance into higher learning. CONCLUSION: By understanding and mastering the state standards by the end of the school year will improve the comprehension of the students in understanding the new stringent requirements for high school and entrance into higher learning. Many of the new standards that our teachers and students must achieve can and will be difficult to implement into a short period of time. Many studies have concluded that the more standards a district has to meet, the more time teachers spend \"teaching to the test\" rather than really \"teaching\" the material. The more standards that have to be covered, the less time that really occurs in classrooms. 19 PREGNANT WOMEN MUST DROP OUT OF. THE M.U LT I - L E V E L. AN R. DS ( AND. STAND ARDS ARE NOT.

That subject will require twice as much time in the classroom to prepare the student for that subject III. I will teach you all that you need to learn that subject IV. That subject will take all of my time away from you as students, to complete this task, which will require more time. CONCL USION: By teaching you nothing, or very little in the time I had to teach you, you will pass my class, and you will receive your teaching certificate. \"It appears that when there are only a few standards that can be taught in the time allotted, this results in greater proficiency by the end of the year. The higher the standards, the greater the need for the teacher to spend time on teaching one standard at a time. This means that there is not much time for the teacher to spend on testing or other activities; more time is spent \"teaching\". \"There is no point in having students spend an inordinate amount of time learning irrelevant skills which are not necessary for them to be successful.\"\n22 CON. #7: I.

A: A 3% correction factor should be applied in the design flow chart to yield the design flow of 205 lb/s at (3) (or 20.65 lb/S at ). The supply air total pressure is 11 lb/s at t(3) (or 10.96 lb/S at ). A ducting system having Rw value of 0.26 with a 1 m diameter duct is sized to provide the air flow of 10.96 lb/s (or 3% correction from (3) design point) at the recruitment air outlet. For the same Rw value with 1 m ID and the same quantity of recruitment air at (13) lb/s the duct must be 0.51 m ID in circumference. The pressure drop due to the recruitment air is 1.1 lb/s. The recruitment air outlet is at 80% relative humidity, temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity of 67%. At (16) the humidity is 0%. As a result, the water vapor amount will be reduced from the source, thus reducing the amount of moisture that will be deposited. The humidity ratio at (13) is therefore reduced to 0% instead of 63% as would be seen at outlet at (16). Q: A ductwork system (36\" wide at 25') and 36\"x42\" at the inlet is used for all distribution ducts except the return air supply, which is designed to be 36\" in width and 42\" in length. The system is equipped with air supply dampers, which are 36\"x36\" in size. The ductwork system is designed at low pressure. The supply is designed to provide 0.5 lb/sf of supply air at the design point, which is then 0.75 lb/S at 30\" above the finished floor and at 40 feet. An exhaust fan is located at the center of the space. The fan is 7' above the finished floor and has an air outlet of 0.40 lb/s at the lowest point in the exhaust path. The inlet is at 10\" above the supply grate, an average. The highest air velocity measured by a probe located at the center of the supply duct. The air velocity is 1000 ft/min = 160 CEL (16,000 ft3/min). (Hint: Qx = (D x Q)/ (D x Vel) = 160. (D/A = 1.6).) The average velocity is measured at the supply grate to be 1200 ft/m = 220 CEL (15,000 ft3/min). (Hint: Average velocity = 2750 ft/m (Vel) = 27.5 ft/min. Use this value when checking the ventilation fan's power output. Note that the air velocity at the supply grate of 220 CEL is too low, thus reducing the amount of air volume that is transferred to the grate. (510 R, 385 CFM, 11.3 Lb/ft3). Assume that the supply duct is 16 feet long and that the exhaust fan is in the center of the space. For a standard CFM 385 CFM, and 380 CFM at 10\" 10\" elevation. The lowest CFM occurs at 0 0 cm3/s at 5.5 cm2/h2o (11.7 ft3/min at 5.5 x 10 to the -3 x 102 or 1703). A ventilation system is required to extract the smoke that has entered the space through an open or damaged door. At the inlet of the smoke duct, which has a one-way opening to the outside and which is 18\"2-18\"2 long, the velocity is 800 ft/min (15,000 ft3/min). The exhaust fan is in the middle of the space and is located at 11'. The air flow rate is 300 CFL. Assuming that the duct is 7.5 M long, determine Qx at t(3). Calculate the amount of CFM that will be required for the airflow (300 cfm) to remain below the smoke duct inlet when the duct is in the open position. Hint: CFM = D x Qx/ Velocity A 10% correction factor must be used in the design flow diagram to yield CFM (300 cfm) 10% below the smoke duct inlet when the duct is in the closed position (375 CFM). For a duct that is 7 5' long, the velocity should be 2400 ft/min. Qx = = 2.15 lb/s at t(3) or Qx = 8.0 q 7.9 at 30' hf = 0.39 lb of CFM. Hint: Qx = (D x Q)/ (D x Vel) = 2.15 lb/S (21.5 lbq/s); or 3.4 q of CFM (9.0 q) . Calculate the velocity of Qx in lb/S at t(1) for a duct that is 36\" wide and 42' long. The outlet is located 26\" (0. The inlet is 3\" wide. As a result, the duct is sized at 6', or 50'. ) (or (50' D x Qx/Vel) = = 4.8 q. To calculate the CFD, D = 16 x 42 and the inlet Velocity is 750 ft/m or 91. = 3.17 q. The total duct and outlet Velocity value for duct with D = 16 ft2, Q = 2.05 q and Vel = 840 ft/min (or Q = 0.41 q) at 26\" and 42' long. The outlet is located 6\" above the floor.

D) No dogs are reptiles. r singerHOME fog pressure Gill HE", "generated_output": "ENEGAN2020 1 The correct answer is A,\nAll brown animals are dogs\n\nComment: Please share your approach if given anytime\n\nAnswer: It's statement C: \"All reptiles are brown\" that's not valid, not statement A.\n\n\"Reptiles\" would include crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and things like that. There are plenty of mammals that are brown. If we accept the premises, any mammal is either a brown dog or a non-brown mammal, but to have a dog we must have brown. Statement C means that \\em{all} reptiles are brown, but some that would qualify as reptiles (lizards, for example) are not brown. This would be true when we have premises 2 and 3 stated (no mammals are reptiles) but not premise 1 (all dogs are mammals).\n\nLet's review the reasoning.\n\nLet's look at the first premise (1):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nSome dogs are brown\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNotice that if we don't have a \\em{brown} dog, this statement is necessarily false. No statement is \\em{truly} true that has no valid support (\"some dogs ... \\em{must be true}\"). We know that some dogs must be brown because there are brown \\em{dogs} (even if we don't know of any of those dogs).\n\nIf we had a dog that wasn't brown, it \\em{wouldn't be a dog}. What type of animal would it \\em{be}? We have no reason to disqualify all the possible options. The only options we know are true are mammals. Statements like \"some dogs aren't mammals\" will fail because it's always impossible to tell which types of animal a pet \\em{isn't}. If it's a dog, it \\em{must} be a mammal!\n\n(There is nothing in the definition of dogs that states that brown dogs must exist. Dogs could be purple. They just \"must\" be mammals, because only mammals make valid \"dog\"s, so any animal that is neither a dog nor a mammal is not and can not be a dog.)\n\nLet's look now at the second premise (2):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nNo mammals are reptiles.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIn short, if all dogs are mammals, and no mammals are reptiles, then no dogs can be reptiles, since dogs are mammals. This is \\em{not} the same as saying that all reptiles are brown. That's a \\em{lot} too broad, because there are brown mammals. No brown mammals can be reptiles, but some brown mammals can be dogs.\n\nWe should note, however, that not all mammals are brown. Even without the second premise, it would be invalid to conclude that there can be no brown dogs, based on the statement that all dogs are mammals, and some mammals are brown. Any brown animal \\em{could be a dog.} Perhaps it is a dog! Perhaps it \\em{is} a dog. This is the only way that the premises would be true \\em{and} we could be sure of it.\n\nThink. You have a brown animal. Any given brown animal \\em{could be a} dog. It is not necessarily false to conclude that the animal \\em{is} a dog (if it is brown and has characteristics of a dog). You don't necessarily know which of the 2 statements are actually true:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nSome dogs are brown.\n\nAll dogs are brown.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\em{(I'm excluding 'some dogs are brown' because it's definitely true. We know it without having to know the definition of dogs, which presumably is a short list of qualities that make an animal \\em{a} dog.)}\n\nWith the first premise (1), we'd never come to the conclusion that there are no brown dogs. If there is brown dog, one will be valid: it could be either (a) a brown dog, and no mammal; or (b) not brown mammal.\n\nPremise (1) says\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nSome dogs are brown.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis statement implies that the only options for valid dogs are mammals. If this premise (or the conclusion) were true and we had to determine if an animal was a valid dog, the two options would be\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nthis animal is a mammal\n\nthis animal is not a valid dog\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWe'd never come to the conclusion that there was no brown dog if we started with premise (1). It's invalid!\n\nWith the second premise, there's no way to tell which or how many brown dogs there are. \\strong{There are no rules on how to interpret \"and some mammals are brown.\"} The only way to make it so that there were no brown dogs is to say that all mammals are brown. \\strong{You can't know for sure that any dog is going to be brown.}\n\nTherefore, this is an invalid argument. Some valid arguments are \"no brown dogs\" and \"every dog is valid.\"\n\n\\strong{Edit. I wanted to add a quick note for what is happening if neither premise holds. There's no requirement of how many brown dogs there are, of course. But without the second premise, the only way we know there can't be an infinite number of brown dogs is if all dogs were brown, because as I said, no type of animal can be a dog if it doesn't meet the requirements of 'dog'. If you have a brown dog, it could be a mammal. In that case, all dogs are brown and all mammals are brown, so no brown dogs would be invalid (since only mammals could be the valid dogs). If there were no brown dogs, that would be invalid, since we can't tell for sure if any dog is brown without the second premise.}\n\nThis doesn't happen often, of course, but I believe it \\em{does happen}. Statements without a 'valid or invalid' context are always invalid (unless they are true or false), but the 'and some mammals are brown' statement isn't really a statement (it's a phrase/statement). So if the statements in question were \"all dogs are mammals\", and \"mammals can be brown\" then \\strong{both (valid and invalid) could be true.}\n\nComment: Not just some dogs are brown: \"All dogs have fur\". You're saying \"Some mammals are brown\" and I don't understand this statement.\n\nComment: In the 2nd sentence you write: \"but no brown mammals can be reptiles\", but there are some (of course brown) mammals that can be reptiles, like dolphins, sharks, etc.\n\nAnswer: It's not statement D. It's statement B that is valid. I don't use the word 'reptile' in this statement, but it's the same idea.\n\n\\strong{\"Some dogs are brown.\"}\n\nThis says that in the entire population of dogs, some are brown. At minimum, one has to exist. If brown was an essential quality of a dog, then statement B would be \"All dogs are brown.\" However, it's not. I can still have a brown dog if brown is not essential to be a dog. For brown to be a requirement, we need to remove the phrase \"Some dogs are brown\" and put something different in its place.\n\nThe following statement would be valid:\n\n\\strong{\"No mammals are reptiles.\"}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Some reptiles are brown.\n\\item Brown mammals are reptiles.\n\\item No reptiles are brown.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nStatement B implies that some mammals that \\strong{aren't} brown are still reptiles. This is false - by the definition of \\strong{reptiles} (or however you define them), no mammals are reptiles. Therefore only some mammals are either brown or reptiles (depending on how you define 'brown').\n\nWe can't say that if something is a dog, then it's also brown. That's not true. Brown mammals can be dogs.\n\nComment: As I understand it, this one here:  _Some mammals are brown and some are not_ must be regarded as: _Dogs are mammals, and some mammals are brown, and some mammals are not_.\n\nComment: @SethRice I think it's pretty clear that some dogs are brown and some are not. That would invalidate the argument. The real issue is how much of the statement is valid, and B looks ok to me.\n\nComment: Okay, I can sorta see what you're saying now, but I don't think you'res right. Let's look at this one: _Some mammals are brown, all dogs are mammals,_ now all mammals are brown?\n\nComment: @SethRice I think there may be some issue with 'some' or 'any'. It doesn't change the rest of the argument in any meaningful way, though, so I think this is a good one. If it's not meaningfully different if I change \"any\" to \"some\", does it change anything?\n\nComment: I mean, it's pretty obvious to me that it's really referring to \"some\" mammals being brown.\n\nComment: I am saying that 'some' refers to at least one brown mammal. There is no reason to believe in the premise of the argument that any brown mammals would be dogs, or that the 'some' refers to any particular percentage of the mammals.\n\nComment: \"All dogs are mammals, and some mammals are brown\" is still false if all mammals are brown. If statement D is true, then \"All dogs are mammals, and no mammals are reptiles\" is also true. Also, 'some' refers to \"at least 1 and not all\".\n\nComment: I have never seen anyone put a question mark right next to a 'some'. I agree that if some refers to an arbitrary set, then your claim that 'all mammals are brown' is false is invalid, but that shouldn't change anything else in my analysis. What if we're counting penguins, and put 'some' next to 'non-brown'?\n\nComment: Statement D is false. All mammals that are brown are reptiles, or we could have a brown mammal that wasn't a reptile - but there are no brown mammals.\n\nComment: I'm not disagreeing with you about D, I'm agreeing with it. What I'm saying is that to use D as a support, I think you have to have 'all mammals' referring to all dogs, or an appropriate subset. Since the 'some' refers, as in an argument like this... to an arbitrary 'some'... then you have to look at 'some' in isolation from all the other claims/statements.\n\nComment: I think both you and I agree that it's invalid. I was just pointing out what would violate it - by changing the definition of brown mammals.\n\nComment: I'm not worried about changing the definition of brown mammal. I'm worried about changing the definition of 'mammals'. For example, some mammals that aren't brown do not need to be reptiles in order to not be dogs, if that makes sense.\n\nComment: And, I should ask, how do you know that 'some' refers to an arbitrary brown mammal? Because that's a bit harder than just saying \"All dogs aren't mammals or reptiles\" - in the argument, all *any* brown mammal that isn't brown is a dog is false. Statement D doesn't need to be true to violate it. It's invalid.\n\nComment: I think you're reading something into D that's not there. It doesn't reference 'some'. We're talking about 'all brown mammals are brown', and that might be true if I change 'some brown mammals' in statement B to, for example, 'dogs'. But the point of the argument is that the statement \"some brown dog are dogs\" is invalid. 'some brown mammal is brown' should refer to 'some brown mammals' (for example, all brown mammals are brown) and there is, as I've told you, no reference to 'some brown mammal' in the argument. That seems to be an arbitrary subset because... it means all dogs.\n\nAnswer: Your argument is invalid.  The reason, as pointed out in the other answers, is that the second premise is too strong.\n\nSuppose your dog-ness is defined by the statement \"All dogs are brown.\"  We get the following argument (valid because its two statement are both true and have the correct antecedent and consequent):\n\n\\section{P1}\n\n\"All dogs are brown\"\n\n\\section{P2}\n\n\"Some dogs are brown\"\n\n\\section{C}\n\n\"Some dogs are brown -> Some mammals are brown\"\n\nThe reptiles statement is incorrect because it doesn't tell us enough.  We can't say that reptiles are brown because even though it is true that all reptile have scales the definition of reptile doesn't require that.\n\nAnswer: Let me try to get a basic idea:\n\nYou have this argument:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nSome dogs are brown\n\nAll reptiles are brown.\n\nSo, no brown mammals are reptiles.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe reason I put the second premise in the form I did (and the same with your original question) was to show that your first conclusion is NOT true.\n\nYou have made the false assumption that the second premise is true. By the way, I notice that the two premises are actually at odds with each other: You say that 'All dogs are brown' is NOT sufficient to get 'All brown mammals are dogs'. However, if it is not sufficient for dogs, then it MUST be insufficient for reptiles. (In other words, you're saying that if 'All dogs are brown' is NOT sufficient for dogs, then it MUST be sufficient for reptiles. Right?)\n\nIn any case, because you have the false assumption (that reptiles are brown) you are NOT able to make the valid conclusion that 'No brown mammals are reptiles'.\nI guess I don't quite understand the point behind this argument.\n\nComment: The point, I guess, should be apparent.  (1) \"all dogs are brown\" doesn't (necessarily) tell us what colour reptiles are.  (2) \"All dogs are brown\" doesn't (necessarily) tell us what colour non-dog mammals are.  (3) \"Some dogs are brown\" doesn't tell us what colour all mammals are.  The logical problems are not obvious to everyone, so that is the point I made...\n\nComment: I think you answered the question.  I hope it helped.\n\nAnswer: The statement\n  \"Mammals that are brown are all reptiles\"", "num_tokens_generated": 3552, "OGF": 0.8671875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 87.46582269668579, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 772, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

If you make good use of your time, you will live stress-free and achieve everything that you want. It\u2019s just a matter of re-arranging your priorities. It could be helpful, if you keep some time for all of your work so that you don\u2019t feel overloaded and can tackle every project smoothly. If you don\u2019t, you will start to lose your valuable time and soon, you\u2019ll be overwhelmed by so many things to do. You have to be realistic when it comes to time management. It does not mean that you are unable to achieve your set targets or that you can\u2019t complete your work in a given time. It simply means that you have more tasks that can wait.\nSome things need to be prioritized over others. You need to decide what needs to be done first and what can wait. By having a proper schedule and using your time efficiently, you\u2019ll be able to concentrate your working efforts and reduce the burden on your shoulders. Even though time management sounds like an abstract or philosophical notion, it is very much a part of real life. You can easily use it to your advantage.\nTime management is the key if you want a balanced life. It helps you deal with time in a way that is beneficial to you. Without a proper schedule, tasks tend to pile up, and it affects you mentally and physically.\nHere are the different time management strategies that you should follow to gain full control over the time on your hands.\nCreating a to-do list is the first step towards time management. You should categorize the list into important and unimportant tasks. It makes you realize what needs your immediate attention and what can wait. Apart from that, a to-do list serves other purposes as well. You can easily cross out each item once you have crossed it off the list.\nTo further enhance the effectiveness of the list, you need to set deadlines for yourself. It will force you to take action. Moreover, you can set personal deadlines according to your schedule or you can make them mandatory.\nThe Pomodoro technique is used by most of the workplaces. Under this technique, you have to work for 25 minutes without any interruption. After that, you need to take a break for 5 minutes. And repeat the same. This technique works like a time management tool to increase your productivity.\nTime management allows a person to accomplish the important tasks without having to worry about the other less important work. If you have a list, it becomes very easy to keep track of what needs to be done. And what can wait.\nIt can be difficult to plan and manage your everyday life as well as work. Time management is very helpful in a work setting where everything happens fast. You need to prepare for meetings, call someone for help, talk to people over the phone, etc. And do everything within a specific time limit. Using time management techniques helps you deal with all of these situations.\nYou can use these techniques for your work as well as personal life. Time is the most valuable resource when you can use it wisely. All you need is a good work ethic and time management skills. And you will be able to complete the work that you need to do.", "num_tokens_generated": 3575, "OGF": 0.872802734375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 88.5920045375824, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 774, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Pigeons in the rushes. What else? Nothing else. It is the same as before, as it has been all through time. You might say that nothing else will exist, but then you are only saying it again. So it is the same, and it has always been the same. The rushes will not change. Pigeons will fly in and around and through and alongside them and then fly on to somewhere else, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The rushes will still be there when, in a few years, this very moment will be another ripple on the surface of things. If you stand on the bank of a wide river and, having counted six ripples, you see one again, this seventh ripple is the same as the previous one. It\u2019s not a different ripple. It\u2019s the seventh repetition of the very same ripple, exactly the same as the sixth, and the sixth exactly the same as the fifth, and the fifth exactly the same as the fourth, and the fourth exactly the same as the second. So it is with time \u2013 that sense of the inexorable and endless movement forward. It\u2019s just the same ripple, arriving at different points. Time is circular and the ripples are the same ones. Time is linear and the ripples are the same ones. Time is neither one thing nor the other, but a mixture of the two, which is perhaps why it seems so complicated. But that is not what it is. It seems to go on and on and on, and what we experience is a kind of motion, as we travel from thing to thing, place to place, idea to idea, word to word. But things are not really travelling, and although it seems to change in a number of ways, what is really happening is that everything changes, and then remains the same. If you go back to the beginning, to the point where your journey started, then you will find the exact same things there that you have just been through. Some of them will be quite difficult to recognise, because you will find them in a new context and have forgotten what they looked, sounded, smelt, tasted and felt like. And some of them will be completely unaltered, because nothing has moved. And, although you will be astonished to meet them in the same places as yesterday, these things will continue to exist in the face of how you have treated them and your perception of them and your memory of them, just as before. In the same way, when you go on to somewhere else, you will find the very same things there. If you go around for a year, a week, a month or a minute, it does not matter. Things will exist. You will meet and encounter and change these things, as always, and you will leave. But they will remain \u2013 for ever.

The owner of 10 has a rabbit in the back yard.\nOn the morning of the 25th, the rabbit escaped from the back yard of the house numbered 10.\nOn the morning of the 26th, the dog belonging to the owner of 9 killed the rabbit.\nOn the morning of the 27th, the rabbit found its way into the henhouse belonging to the owner of 2.\nOn the morning of the 28th a fox strolled into the henhouse. To add to the confusion, as a child, the owner of 2 had always wanted to be a florist, so he planted petunias, violets, irises and nary a single rose to be seen. Now the fox is penned in behind the petunias but must find its way out of the back yard. He spotted the henhouse and now is very careful to keep to the flower beds, so that he won't step on the petunias.\nWhat is the day of the week on which the petunias originally found themselves in the henhouse?\n```\n---\n### Solution\n```\nThe dog owned by the owner of number 9 killed the rabbit on the morning of the 27th day, the 28th day came and the fox came and ate the chickens, however, the chickens were in the coop and fox must have ran through the garden with no issue, so the day the petunias are in the house must be on a Monday!\n```\n\n\n```\nThe dog killing the rabbit has to be the day the fox is in the chicken house. On the 27th day the dog killed the rabbit so it has to be on the 28th so the chances of the fox being in the hen house on the 28th are really slim because the fox can't escape the house that day and no chances of the rabbit dying that day. Since they were both in the hen house on the 27th its obvious that they where outside the house on the 28th. Therefore the day will have to be on a monday to have the rabbit, dog or fox in the house on the same day.\n```\n---\n### Solution\n```\nThe petunias were in the henhouse on the 28th day.\nIn this case, the dog kills the rabbit on the 27th day and the fox makes it to the henhouse on the 27th night. Then the only way for this to work is to say that the rabbit and the dog are in the same garden on the same day and that must be the previous day.\nSince rabbit and dog are in the same garden, then the fox has to be in the same garden right?\nSince they are all in the same garden, why does one of them not move? The only way that is possible is if the fox is in the rabbit's house, dog is in the rabbit house, dog is in the fox house and the rabbit is in the fox house.

In this case, you should use `g++-11` (for C++20) or `g++-10` (for C++17). You can check by doing `-E` (for preprocessor-output) and do `-dM` (for the command-line flags) before your invocation of `g++`.\n\nAs for the long command-execution times, this is typical for `clang++` compared to `g++-11` if `--std=gnu++14` is used, that is using C++14 standard when using `-std=gnu++14`. (Of course, `-std=gnu++14` is not officially supported by `clang++` anyhow...)\n\n(Caveat: it's possible that `clang++` uses some features from `-std=gnu++17` for some reason that aren't specified in the documentation.)\n\nRegarding the slow compilation, the [manual of clang++-11](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) mentions that it only starts optimising once it's seen the whole program.\n\n\\strong{Example}\n\n(The following example has been adapted from `main.cpp`)\n\n\\begin{code}\n$ clang++ -std=gnu++17 --save-temps main.cpp | wc -l\n31 Files\n\n$ clang++ --save-temps -O0 --no-save-temps main.cpp | wc -l\n3 Files\n\n$ clang++ --no-save-temps -O0 main.cpp | wc -l\n11 Files\n\n$ clang++ --save-temps main.cpp --save-temps main.cpp -O0\n10 Files\n\n$ clang++ --save-temps main.cpp\n10 Files\n\\end{code}\n\nSo, as a rule of thumb you should do the optimization early, and do the `clang++` with an explicit `-O4` for faster compilation.\n\n[Note that the time taken for the first version is the compilation time -i.e. it's the cost of the preprocessing phase alone, so you can't expect to see large optimizations on very short test-cases as this might not have any influence on the preprocessing time spent.]\n\nComment: \"11 Files\" for one-liner `clang++ -O0 main.cpp` seems quite strange to me, could you explain this?\n\nComment: I think that it only checks for one file `main.cpp`.\n\nComment: \"the manual of clang++-11\" - yes. In this case, we are using clang++-11, so your argument is moot, or should I say, invalid.

It might make the compiler make fewer micro-optimizations it wouldn't otherwise make.\n\nComment: @OliCharlesworth that doesn't explain why sorting should bring the data into the cache, just that sorting could (I think) give worse results if it doesn't have anything to do with that particular cache.\n\nComment: I thought the point made in the question was that there were no micro-optimizations needed *in the first place*, so I though this wasn't the case, and that there was definitely no \"gonna help with the cache\" (but I've now updated to a more accurate summary. Thanks.)\n\nAnswer: The result is because of [cache misses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_miss), which is why I suggest always sorting your data.\n\nThe effect should diminish with newer processors that have a cache size large enough to keep the data in cache for an entire loop body. But this is of course more noticeable in C than in Java.\n\nComment: If you go for the more expensive approach of pre-sorting, which might save you the trouble of having to write your own implementation, your sorting method better be super fast/efficient.

First of all, the values are spread much more widely across the memory address range, which increases cache misses dramatically.  Secondly, your program (as written) makes very irregular accesses to the memory contents, which does not help cache efficiency in memory locations that are very recently accessed and not near any previously accessed locations.\n\nAdditional information:  [How Much Does Caching Affect Performance?](http://www.michaelgalegus.com/2010/02/28/how-much-does-caching-affect-performance.html)\n\nComment: If the random access pattern is as good as with this code, then the fact that it's not all in one place when I ask for the first data doesn't seem to matter.\n\nComment: @user93249: In any case, it's worth knowing that you can significantly improve the appearance of your performance by adding proper caching to your code (e.g. by replacing your `sum += data[c]` operation with `sum += data[c - arraySize]`)\n\nComment: @user93249 I am no expert but it seems that the sorting is taking place in memory and therefore does not generate as much cache miss as the unsorted case.\n\nComment: And the array is very sparse, if you know that data[c] will exceed 128 just access it once.\n\nAnswer: Since you know that the first entry will be less than 128, it is better to access that variable first, not second.\n\nComment: You'll have to explain to me how this makes a difference. The next access is still the second access and is still not guaranteed to be the 128th one.\n\nComment: It also can't take the sum over the loop, so it will have to take up to 100000 iterations and store each one as it goes.\n\nComment: @user93249 I don't know exactly what your point is, and you may be oversimplifying to make it easier to understand, but consider that sorting is faster because the access pattern is more regular.  In other words, it does not have to access a given cell twice to read it.  It does not even have to access half the cells.  It might only need to access 2 cells (the first one already known, and the one that is the 128th one).  It knows which one is the 128th, so if you do it in the sorted order, you know which one the 128th one is too!\n\nComment: No, the sorting code itself will be more complex since you now have to keep a pointer to the sorted array.

And the way u have chosen, is totally confusing the things.\nYou have to understand,\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item for in loop will first execute the `i` variable, then goes to `setTimeout`, after that executes `console.log(i)`\n\\item You need a loop, with `let i = for in, sum =` variables, and `i` needs the values of `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, ... of the array\n\\item You just need to use the values, for the `console.log(i)`\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Below snippet} shows the desired output\n\n\\begin{code}\nlet sum = 0;\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nfor (let i in numbers) { sum += i }\nconsole.log(sum)\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: For your reference, you can get more info from this thread: [enter link description here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53527148/javascript-for-in-method-not-looping-through-array-in-the-right-order#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20W3C,to%20the%20array%20in%20the%20correct%20order.&text=JavaScript%20does%20not%20order%20the%20elements%20of%20arrays%20in%20index%20order.&text=To%20get%20the%20elements%20in%20index%20order%2C%20we%20can%20use%20the%20method%20for%20in%20loop.)\n\nComment: i need to print the sum value @Jenny-Xi-Gan\n\nComment: @giveaway please put a comment if you need better way for solving something instead for downvoting\n\nAnswer: You are misusing `for...in` there.\n\nYou can simplify things a lot if you are using lodash. First, you can use [_.forEach](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.0/functions#forEach)\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar result = _.forEach(numbers, function (number, i) {\n  sum += number\n  console.log(i);\n});\n\\end{code}\n\nNote that ES6 has `.forEach` with the same semantics.\n\nAlso, [_.reduce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.0/methods/#reduce) can be used to calculate the sum and its first argument is the accumulator\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar sum = _.reduce(numbers, function (value, sum, i) {\n  return sum + value\n}, 0)\n\\end{code}\n\nFinally. You can write you code like this\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar sum = _.reduce(numbers, function (sum, value, i) {\n  console.log(value, i);\n  return sum + value\n}, 0)\n\\end{code}\n\nNote that I am logging each sum and iteration to make sure things are working ok... You can use [`.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to trim the result before returning\n\nComment: The OP is using for in loops, and wants to see the values of each number in the array\n\nComment: You are right @NickParsons I didn't realize it is a `for...in` in the OP code. I will re-order my answer to suit the OP needs better, thanks for pointing out\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\nlet numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\nvar sum = 0;\nlet i =0;\n\n(function sum(){\n  console.log(numbers)\n  for(let index in numbers)\n  {\n     console.log(numbers[index], index)\n     sum+=numbers[index]\n     ++i\n   }\n})\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: You need to indent 4 spaces to get code formatting.", "num_tokens_generated": 1192, "OGF": 0.291015625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 27.13446617126465, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 792, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The German experience was very different. The First World War ended the German empire and helped to shape the political structure that would come to power after the Second World War.\nThe First World War had a profound impact on the British and German economies and their subsequent development. The British Empire lost a huge amount of its overseas trade and, as a result, found itself very exposed to Germany's economic and industrial dominance. This was made worse by the fact that, in the years following the First World War, the German economy experienced a massive depression. The combination of the two factors led to a decline in British trade. However, despite the negative impact on British trade, the war also had a positive effect on Germany's economy. The war was very important to the formation of German nationalism during the period between the wars when Europe was divided into two alliances and the country was undergoing rapid industrialisation. As a result, the war had a profound influence on the formation of German nationalism and helped to create the conditions for the reunification of Germany after the Second World War.\nBy the time the war ended Germany had become the most powerful militaristic state in Europe and\nThe First World War on the German side\nThe German side shows that, on the British and German, the war ended the German economy.
