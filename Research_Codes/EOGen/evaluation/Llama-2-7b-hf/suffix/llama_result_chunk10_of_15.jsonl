This non-toxic gas has even been demonstrated to be extremely effective in the treatment of numerous severe illnesses (including heart disease, renal disease, and cancer).\nForex rates for euro: What makes Europeans take so much from the dollar that no one notices it\nThe euro is currently the second most popular international reserve currency, behind only the United States dollar. But the euro has not really had any difficulties and is still very popular around the globe. This makes sense because you never feel like you\u2019re paying too little or too much at the European currency. Many people in Europe prefer to buy dollar assets. Others make other payments in this currency.\nMany people use the euro for their travel needs, as it is by far the most widely used currency on earth. It is a good idea to exchange some dollars for euro, as it may be useful for travel. Many of the travel sites have a large list of currencies, so you can select from many different currencies to find what meets your needs. The euro is often a bit less expensive than the euro dollars, but if you choose to get more of the euro than the US dollar, you will have paid a bit more. There is no other currency that is available in this range.\nIn a large market, there are many companies that sell the euro at a lower price than the euro itself. This is one of the most interesting parts of the forex market, because one can find a large range of currencies available in various sizes at different prices.\nThese days, it is becoming more popular to buy foreign currencies online rather than from a store or bank, as well as at the airport. It is also possible to transfer currency from foreign websites to a local bank. Many of the bigger banks make this available. This is just one of the ways for people to do business when it is not feasible to go to a location to obtain a foreign currency.\nA foreign currency exchange may also allow people to be flexible in their use of the euro. For instance, if you are traveling abroad, you can choose to buy euros when the price of the dollar has dropped a bit. It is also possible to buy the euro and use it for an online travel agency. This is a great option for people who like to travel a lot.\nA forex trader can also buy and sell euros at a discount compared to the euro itself. This makes it more convenient to exchange currencies at different times and at different rates.\nOne advantage to purchasing foreign currencies online is that you can do it at any time, regardless of your time zone. There is no rush to buy or sell because you are not working during the day, so there is no need to get the time of day right.\nA forex trader has a much broader selection of currencies when they can buy them without having to go through a bank. That may be an advantage, but in the end, it is still much cheaper to buy from a store or bank.\nWhich is not exactly that simple! There are many ways to make a profit on the currency trade and one of the easiest ways is to just buy a particular currency and sell it when it moves up in value. When it goes up, you buy more. It is a very simple way to do it.\nYou can trade currencies online without having to deal with an agent or broker. You can trade both ways, buying and selling.\nWhat Is Online Homework Help For?\nOnline schooling has transformed education.

The positive consequences are more focused on happiness.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Is your belief in utilitarianism altered by any of these consequences?* \n\nI believe in all of these consequences. Even though I don't believe that utilitarianism is the best moral code to follow, I feel that we can all learn what we can from this moral code. Utilitarianism has the same basic premise of being a social welfare system, which I believe is a good thing.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Is your belief in utilitarianism affected by this moral code's role in society, or would your feelings about the code remain the same if it did not exist alongside other moral codes?* \n\nNo, however, I am not sure why utilitarianism has the same positive and negative consequences regardless of role in society.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Compared to a pluralistic society, a utilitarian society is one in which the moral/social norm is that people must act so that they act morally. Does having the \"right\" moral code or belief inevitably lead to a better society?* \n\nI believe that the right moral code is just a basic rule of what it is to be moral. Even though I disagree with utilitarianism being what it means to be moral, or that acting on utilitarian morals leads to a better society, there are many morals that do lead to a better society.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What is ethical egoism?\n\n- It says that people should take care of themselves first.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\n- A) Aristotelianism B) Kantianism C) Utilitarianism D) Egoism\n\n**Reflect on:** *Why might somebody believe he can act in his own self-interest without causing any harm to others?* \n\nI am not sure why this is. If someone believes they can act in their own self-interest without causing harm to others, then they are likely to act egoistically. It seems to make the most sense that those who act differently are not egoistic or that their self-interest happens to be aligned with others'.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *What would be the consequences of egoism in a society?*\n\nThis is hard to predict.\nIf no consequences, then we could assume these effects are small or not worth noting.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Is egoism compatible with modern society? That is, do you think someone can live happily in our society if he acts according to the ethical system of egoism? Why or why not?* \n\nI am not sure about this one. If it is not compatible, then one should look into another moral code to follow.\n\n---\n\nChoose the correct answer. r longHOMEGo pressureactual HEALING\n\n### Answer Process:\n\n![](../.gitbook/assets/57a8ebfbb755ce91dc8e.png)\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *How does this moral system relate (or not relate) to other moral systems?*\n\nThe only time I have heard this morals discussed is with the utilitarian moral code. Both utilitarianism and egoism have the basic building blocks of the moral code, but utilitarianism requires people to have altruistic thoughts and behaviors while egoism does not.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In what societies has the moral philosophy of Act Utilitarianism been most prevalent?*\n\nHard to say honestly. Any society that is a \"pluralistic society\" would use utilitarianism.\n\n---\n\n## 4) What is virtue ethics?\n\n- It says that people should live their lives right and honestly.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\n- A) Aristotelianism B) Kantianism C) Egoism D) Virtue ethics\n\n**Reflect on:** *Why is living a virtuous life difficult?* \n\nPractice is often required in order to learn what is considered a virtue and be able to exhibit these virtues. With practicing different virtues in specific scenarios, these behaviors can become ingrained in your life.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *When is it appropriate to exhibit some virtues but disregard others?* \n\nAnytime that you know you'll disobey a particular virtue, then it is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Who is the typical person responsible for teaching us moral values?* \n\nThis seems to be either one's parents or other family members that have the responsibility of passing down traditions and values.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *With which groups do you most closely associate yourself and with which groups do you most identify?* \n\nI would like to say that I relate with my group of friends in my university, but I also think that I align most closely with my family.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In what circumstances would virtuous living be most difficult?*\n\nCertain circumstances that have bad consequences might be avoided.

Many people would probably prefer a society where the moral code of virtue ethics held greater sway.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In what ways have our values as a society changed, e.g. our respect for property, respect for rules, etc., from what it was three decades ago?* \n\nWe have become more respectful for our property. Overall, we are less violent than we were three decades ago.\n\n---\n\n## 5) What is Kantianism?\n\n- It says that we should treat people as ends in themselves and also judge how we act by our own maxims.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\n- A) Utilitarianism B) Kantianism C) Egoism D) Virtue ethics\n\n**Reflect on:** *Do all humans have these same \"moral facts\" or is it simply the case that all people in the world have \"moral facts\" that are in harmony with one another?* \n\nI believe everyone has these morals. The only problem with this moral theory is that everyone can have different opinions or not be able to articulate the morals because they do not know what they are about.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *What would be different about a universe in which no laws are necessary to avoid harming another person?*\n\nI am not sure for sure. However, I believe that the universe we live in would be more dynamic and possibly \"chaotic\" than in this question.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Do moral theories differ according to culture? If so, what are a few moral differences?* \n\nI would believe that certain moral codes would differ from culture to culture. Certain things vary per culture. This has a lot to do with the belief system of the culture.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In cultures without the notion of a good moral act, how is it possible for those who have the right moral belief to act so that they act morally?* \n\nI do not think that anyone can act on these beliefs unless they are ingrained into their lifestyle.

Everyone deserves to have some form of respect and dignity.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *How does this moral code relate (or not relate) to other moral codes?* \n\nIt seems like this is in the same category of other pluralistic societies based on people's moral code. It would be difficult to compare it to a few other systems since they are different ethical theories.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In what societies might Kantianism hold the greatest sway?*\n\nI believe Kantianism would hold the greatest sway in a society that held individual freedom above all else.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *In what ways should we treat others not merely as ends but as something akin to having moral value?*\n\nI believe that we should treat others as beings that you have moral codes to follow. At times we fail to do this. \n\n---\n\n## 6) What is the principle of the \"Golden Rule?\"\n\n- It says that we should treat others as we would like to be treated.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\nChoose the correct answer.\n\n- A) Utilitarianism B) Kantianism C) Egoism D) Virtue ethics\n\n**Reflect on:** *Do only those who desire that others treat them this way have a reason to think that they ought to treat people according to the Golden Rule?*\n\nI would say that they do not. The only person that would know whether or not they should act on the Golden Rule is themself.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *If one's moral system does not allow one to treat others in this manner, what then would be the appropriate attitude he should adopt?* \n\nI would believe that the appropriate attitude is to not allow someone to treat you this way and not to treat them the way they want to be treated.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Do we need other moral theories in order to have a sound philosophical account of the Golden Rule? If so, what are some of these other theories?*\n\nThey need some other moral theory to complement their own. They can look at other philosophers and their theories for guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Reflect on:** *Do we need other theories in order for the Golden Rule to be considered a moral rule? If so, what are they?*\n\nI would believe they only need moral rules from other theories.

Not only do apples taste good, but they also contain plenty of health benefits that will help you live life to the fullest!\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the 9 health benefits of apples, backed up by scientific research.\nSome of the ways you can start using apples to improve your heart health include:\nEAT them often, whether as a snack or as a part of your breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nDrink them either freshly-squeezed, in a vegetable blend, or as a tasty juice.\nEven better, consider making your own apple juice at home by peeling and slicing them and then blending them in a high-speed blender until they become pure and smooth.\nAPPLES ARE A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC, which strengthens your immune system and reduces the risk of you coming down with illnesses like the flu. Moreover, due to the fact that they contain plenty of antioxidants such as polyphenols and quercetin, they will help you fight off illnesses better when you do happen to get sick!\nAPPLES ARE A good source of calcium and magnesium, essential minerals that play a key role in maintaining healthy bones and teeth. They lower oxidative stress, which reduces inflammation and promotes cell recovery for stronger bones. Therefore, eating apples can help prevent osteoporosis and other age-related diseases that affect your bones.\nAPPLES MAY reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes by lowering your blood sugar levels, reducing insulin resistance, and keeping your energy levels steady throughout the day. They also stabilize your blood sugar by maintaining a healthy metabolic rate.\nAPPLES CONTAIN ANTIOXIDANTS SUCH AS VITAMIN C AND QUERCETIN, both of which can regulate your body\u2019s immune system and lower the risk that you will get sick. In fact, studies have shown that eating apples can boost your overall immune system by strengthening both your adaptive and your innate immune system.\nAPPLES ARE GREAT FOR YOUR digestive system, as they contain insoluble and soluble fiber that help keep your bowel movements regular and healthy, reducing the risk that you will develop digestive issues like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

These fruits are high in antioxidants, which fight stress hormones and reduce aging.\nIt\u2019s easier to make apples a part of your daily diet. We like to cut them into small pieces and mix them with nuts, seeds, fruit and nut butters, or nut oils. Here are some of our favorite ways to include them in our diet:\nThe best way to eat your fill of apples is to eat them raw. However, if you must cook them, steaming or baking is the healthiest method. Avoid adding too much butter and sugar, and always eat your apples with your meal.\nThere is a lot of hype about how many apples are good for you. Some experts recommend one apple per day. But the truth is there is no specific rule. So, as long as you don\u2019t overeat them, you can eat as many as you want.\nApple juice is better for those with kidney and blood issues, but if you don\u2019t like it, try apple puree instead. Apple puree is good for most patients but not when the kidney and blood cells are weak.\nThe best variety of apples that are best for your health. Apples are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. But, it is not always easy to eat them in their natural form. In fact, many of them get peeled and added to juices or baked goods. If you can\u2019t find the apples you want, you can always make them at home. Just cut a whole apple and cut it into two equal pieces. This way you won\u2019t lose any fiber or antioxidants. And you can enjoy them in their natural state.\nIt is true that apples are beneficial to your health. But if you overeat them, you may experience bloating. Eating apple pieces can help reduce bloating and increase energy by absorbing excess carbohydrates before they can settle in the gut. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should eat as many as possible. Avoid overeating and go for small amounts instead.\nBananas are another popular fruit. And they are also a good source of vitamin C, fiber, and potassium. But it is not safe to eat apple and banana together because bananas are high in fructose and have a higher glycemic index. So it should be eaten alone. In addition, bananas are one of the fruits that contain a higher level of fiber. So they are not safe to consume in combination with apples.\nYes, you can! Both fruits are excellent sources of antioxidants, and it is important to eat them in moderation to ensure that they don\u2019t cause more harm than good. Eat apples in between meals to maximize the health benefits and lower the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases that affect the immune system.\nWe hope you have found the information in this article to be both helpful and enlightening.

The modern educational programs are geared towards this perspective in order to prepare the people for the challenges they would face at their work place. The educational programs, therefore, are not just meant for the learning of the basic concepts but also for developing the required competencies.\nThe HPLS, the online adaptive interactive learning system is a web based technology that is intended to develop learner\u2019s competencies. The HPLS is a powerful tool to develop the learner\u2019s self-directed learning ability.\nThe HPLS is based on the concept of learner-centered approach and the constructivist theory. It aims at enabling the learner to maximize his / her own learning efficiency, learning process, and the way of learning. In the HPLS, learning is a dynamic process requiring motivation and the ability to initiative. The program emphasizes that the learner has the responsibility to be an active learner. This means that the learner himself / herself chooses and designs the way he / she wants to learn. The program provides a safe, supportive and interactive environment that supports both the learner\u2019s personal and professional learning goals.\nThe program is not merely the computer based software; rather it combines the computer and software with the educational methods and theories. Here are some important characteristics that distinguish the High Performance Learning System from other learning systems.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 An Internet Based Learning System for Self Directed Learning This is an internet based learning system for self directed learning. The learner needs a computer with access to the internet. The learner may use the computer individually or may enroll for group classes. The program is intended for learners who would like to study independently and at their own time schedule.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 A Concept Oriented Learning System This is a concept oriented learning system. Learning is organized on the concepts instead of facts, theories, rules, and procedures. Most of the educational programs offer information based learning. These programs have many concepts and terms which are listed at the end of the chapter. They are simply listed for the learner to memorize and to master. This is usually called as cramming, rote memorization, and mechanical learning. This type of learning may not stimulate the learner\u2019s creative abilities. In the modern world, knowledge is expanding faster and faster. We, humans, are also growing smarter. This situation demands the educational programs which are directed towards building the learner\u2019s competencies and capabilities to improve his / her performance. This is the concept-based learning system; the educational system that would facilitate the learner\u2019s performance. The concepts are identified on the basis of \u201chow to use the concept\u201d. The learner identifies the concepts on the basis of \u201chow the concept may help improve my performance\u201d.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 An Assessment Oriented Learning System The program is also based on the principle of assessment for learning. This is the principle that emphasizes the learner\u2019s competency in the concepts and procedures. The program emphasizes on the assessment and the improvement of the learner\u2019s competency. This assessment is not the traditional summative evaluation. It is a tool for improvement of the learner\u2019s competency.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 Adaptive Interactive Learning The HPLS provides adaptive and interactive learning activities that are self-directed by the learner. The program provides the learner with feedback at regular intervals that help him / her assess his / her own performance. This allows the learner to improve his / her performance.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 An Education Technology The HPLS is based on educational technology. Educational Technology is the application of educational theory to learners activities. It aims at improving the performance. Hence, the program involves both learning and performance. The program offers a blend of educational theory and educational technology.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 A Non Traditional Learning System The program provides an alternative to the traditional education. The program does not offer the basic knowledge of any subject. Instead, the program offers the basic concepts and skills that are related to any particular subject. This means that the learner is not expected to know the basic concepts in any subject.\nHigh Performance Learning System \u2013 Integrated Learning System The HPLS is an integrated learning system, which means that it would involve many concepts in many subjects. The learner may have selected a subject or two, however, while learning the selected topics, other concepts will be integrated. For example, learning English Language requires a lot of knowledge in Psychology. While learning English Language, Psychological concepts, psychological theories, and psychological terms would be integrated. The HPLS, as we have already said, is an Internet Based Adaptive Interactive Learning System with an integration of assessment and performance.\nREADEL\u00ae\nThe High Performance Learning System\nHigh Performance Learning, Inc.\n3960 Dover St., Suite 247\nThe following sections are not available \u2013 Click on the link to skip to the sections where the relevant topics have been covered.\nIntroduction What is HPLS Self Directed Learning Technology Adaptive Interactive Learning System What is Assessment Oriented Learning System Educational Technology Non Traditional Learning System HPLS \u2013 An Integrated Education System Learning Environment Assessment Learning Interaction Personalized Learning Competency Development Training Concepts Assessment Interdependent HPLS \u2013 An Internet Based Learning Internet High Performance Learning System Internet and Internet Based Computer and Internet Based Web Browser and Internet Based Learning Tools How to Use the HPLS\nIntroduction to Self Directed Learning System\nWhy Self Directed Learning\nHuman beings have a complex nature with both the conscious and the unconscious elements.\nThe conscious elements focus on the objective reality. The unconscious elements involve the subjective emotional aspects of life. It includes the beliefs and attitudes that guide the personality. The conscious and unconscious elements act and function as one.\nLearning, according to the human psycho-physiology is a combination of the conscious and unconscious processes.\nIn addition, according to the Human Psycho-Physiology, both the conscious and the emotional elements are essential for any change to occur.\nSelf Directed Learning is the type of learning in which the individual selects his / her own learning objectives, designs his / her own curriculum and creates his / her own learning environment and pace. As the conscious and unconscious elements are involved, in addition to the conscious and unconscious processes, the learner is involved in self assessment and correction.\nSelf Directed Learning System in a nutshell: Self Directed Learning is the type of learning in which the individual selects his / her own learning objectives, creates his / her own curriculum and designs his / her own learning pace and environment.\nHPLS \u2013 an Internet Based Self-Directed Learning System\nHPLS is the High Performance Learning System, which is an Internet Based Learning Environment, that provides an educational system for self directed learning.\nHPLS \u2013 Self Directed Learning for the Concept-oriented Learning System\nHPLS is a Concept-oriented Learning System that provides the learner with self directed learning system. The self directed learning system of the HPLS allows the learner to learn at his / her own pace.\nConcept-oriented Learning System of HPLS Self directed learning system at the same time provides the learner with all the benefits of the concept-oriented educational system. Concept-oriented learning system of HPLS, adapts the learner\u2019s own learning environment and the learning pace. In addition, it provides a very efficient learning environment which involves both learning and performance. As the learning, in the HPLS, is the process of discovering, constructing, and redefining facts, principles and concepts, the learner is able to create and utilize his / her own learning methods and ways of learning.\nHigh Performance Learning Inc., (HPL Inc.) is an educational services organization in Canada.

It can improve performance, endurance, and health by increasing the amount of oxygen the heart can pump to the body, improving the efficiency of your circulatory system, and improving the body's ability to use oxygen. r longHOME fogCenter spoke HEALTH POWER with Dr. William Roberts, a cardiology professor and chair of the University of Minnesota's Department of Family Medicine and Sports Medicine, about the benefits and risks of HIIT for athletes.Q: How does HIIT differ from other forms of aerobic exercise, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming?A: HIIT is a more intense form of exercise than jogging, cycling, or swimming, because the workout involves short bursts of intense activity followed by brief periods of rest, rather than longer, more extended periods of exercise. r longHOME fogCenter spoke HEALTH POWER with Dr. William Roberts, a cardiology professor and chair of the University of Minnesota's Department of Family Medicine and Sports Medicine, about the benefits and risks of HIIT for athletes.Q: Provide examples of HIIT workouts and explain how they can improve performance, endurance, and health.A: One example of a HIIT workout for athletes would be a workout consisting of intervals with alternating intensities of running and walking. For instance, a workout might consist of short sprints (such as about 30 seconds) followed by a longer period of jogging (such as about two minutes). Another example of a HIIT workout for athletes would be to use a stationary rowing machine. You could start with a high-intensity workout for 30 seconds that consists of you pushing yourself as hard as you can, then follow that with a shorter low-intensity workout for about 30 seconds.Q: Finally, what are the risks of HIIT for athletes?A: The main risk of HIIT is overtraining, which occurs when the body is subjected to so much training that its recovery capacity is overtaxed. r longHOME fogCenter spoke HEALTH POWER with Dr. William Roberts, a cardiology professor and chair of the University of Minnesota's Department of Family Medicine and Sports Medicine, about the benefits and risks of HIIT for athletes.Q: What are some examples of overtraining?A: Examples of overtraining include chronic inflammation caused by overtraining, stress fractures, dehydration, overtraining syndrome, heat illness, and burnout. r longHOME fogCenter spoke HEALTH POWER with Dr. William Roberts, a cardiology professor and chair of the University of Minnesota's Department of Family Medicine and Sports Medicine, about the benefits and risks of HIIT for athletes.Q: What are some recommended limits on HIIT?A: We recommend that athletes limit HIIT sessions to about an hour or less per session.

Not only does it tone your muscles, it also improves your cardiovascular health, improves your strength and stamina, and is easy on the joints.\nBut, like any exercise program, HIIT is best used with a little forethought. Here are some things to keep in mind as you start your HIIT program:\nHIIT is short and intense.\nIt's important to keep your workouts to a short, intense duration in order to get the most out of them. HIIT training typically lasts for about 30 minutes and is hard enough that you won\u2019t need a long warmup or cool-down.\nHIIT workouts are split into high-intensity periods (HIPE) and low-intensity periods(LOPE).\nHIPEs are quick bursts of intense activity, while LOPEs are more prolonged low-intensity workouts.\nHIPEs last for about 30 to 60 seconds each, while LOPEs last for about 2-5 minutes each.\nHIPEs are followed by LOPEs, which are usually slower and more restful.\nHIPEs and LOPEs are alternated for the entire duration of the workout, with varying amounts of rest in between.This variety in intensity keeps the body in an active state, while the rest between sets and during the workout helps you recover.\nHIPEs should be 80% to 95% of your maximum strength, while LOPEs should be 60% to 70% of your maximum strength.\nThe HIPEs in a HIIT workout are usually quicker than the average interval, so they should be a bit more intense, but they should be still safe and comfortable to perform. These HIPEs should be about 80% to 95% of your maximum strength. The LOPEs in a HIIT workout are usually a little longer than the average interval, so they should be a bit slower, but not so much so that it\u2019s uncomfortable to perform. These LOPEs should be about 60% to 70% of your maximum strength.\nHIPEs should not last longer than 30 seconds, while LOPEs should probably not last for longer than 2-5 minutes.\nHIPEs should be performed as fast and as hard as possible, but as quickly as you can.\nHIPEs should be broken up by a short rest period or an active recovery, which is usually 60 to 90 seconds long.\nHIPEs should be performed at a low to moderate intensity, depending on the goals for the specific workout. HIPEs should be performed at a comfortable pace, but not to the point of over-exertion or exhaustion. HIPEs should be long enough to maintain a constant intensity throughout the working portion of the set and through the entire range of motion.\nHIPEs should be performed for at least three sets. HIPEs should not last for longer than 30 seconds, while LOPEs should probably not last for longer than 2-5 minutes.\nLOPEs should be performed at a low to moderate intensity and at a comfortable pace.\nLOPEs should be performed for at least three sets. LOPEs should be 60 to 70% of your maximum strength. LOPEs should not be performed for longer than 2-5 minutes.\nHIPEs should be performed in a controlled manner and should be quick and hard, but not so fast that they are uncomfortable. HIPEs should last for about 30-60 seconds, with short rest periods between sets.\nLOPEs should be performed by increasing the speed over time. HIPEs should not be performed at an intensely high intensity and should not last for more than 30 seconds, while LOPEs should be performed at a moderate to high intensity and should not last for more than 2-5 minutes.\nHIPEs and LOPEs should both have similar intensities, so in order to get the most out of HIIT, you should focus on the intensity,\nFor you fitness freaks who like your workouts tough and fast, HIIT\u2014high-intensity interval training\u2014might be just the workout you\u2019re looking for. A form of interval training that alternates between short bursts of intense exercise and slightly longer periods of recovery, HIIT workouts are popular for their ability to boost metabolism and increase endurance. But to get the maximum benefit from HIIT, you need to put in the work. This post shows you how to get the most out of HIIT, with tips on technique, timing, and how to use it to help you achieve your fitness goals. 1. How to get the most out of HIIT workouts: Get the right kind of workout equipment. HIIT is high-intensity interval training, which means that your workout will likely be extremely hard. In order to maximize your workouts, you need to be able to really push yourself to the limit. As a result, it\u2019s important to have the right kind of workout equipment on hand, like a treadmill or stationary bike. 2. Get the right kind of clothing and footwear for HIIT. The equipment isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019ll need to have on hand in order to maximize your workouts. You\u2019ll also need the right kind of clothing and footwear for HIIT. As with the equipment, it\u2019s important to make sure that your clothes and shoes are supportive and comfortable. The last thing you want is to feel uncomfortable while you\u2019re working out. 3. Get the right diet for HIIT. While you\u2019re working out, you need to make sure that you\u2019re giving your body everything it needs. In order to get the most out of your HIIT workouts, you\u2019ll need to make sure that you\u2019re eating the right kinds of foods.\nHow to get the most out of your HIIT training\nIf you\u2019re an athlete, you\u2019re probably used to high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\nIn fact, HIIT is the most widely used form of exercise in the athletic world. But what does that mean?\nWell, it means that you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of high-intensity interval training.\nYou\u2019ll be going through a high-intensity interval session, which is a very intense workout that will make you really tired. And then you\u2019ll be doing it over and over again.\nBut why? Well, HIIT is really intense and can be pretty tough to do. But it\u2019s also the most efficient way to exercise, because it burns the least amount of calories of any exercise type.\nBut what if you want to get the most out of your HIIT? What if you want to make it really hard to do? A lot of people actually do.\nYou can make HIIT easier: There are a lot of people who believe that you can make HIIT easier, so they\u2019ll do it more often and for longer periods of time.\nBut that doesn\u2019t really help the most.\nHIIT is hard to do. That\u2019s why a lot of people really like to use it. They like the intensity.\nHIIT is intense, and it\u2019s hard to do.\nYou can make HIIT more difficult: You can actually make HIIT harder to do, by increasing the intensity of your interval-training sessions.\nBut that doesn\u2019t really help the most either.\nThe most important thing about HIIT is that you have to do it. You really have to do it.\nYou can\u2019t just stop doing it after a couple of workouts, because you don\u2019t have enough experience to make it easier.\nYou can make it easier for yourself: If you want to make HIIT easier, you can do that. You can start with\nHiit workouts are a fantastic way to get your training done, and they can also improve your overall fitness. Here is a quick guide to getting the most out of your HIIT sessions. 1. Hiit is not as intense as running or interval training.\nThe difference between the two is that hiit is short, and it can be done in a variety of ways, like interval training, stairs, and sprinting. Hiit is also not as fast as interval training or running, so it\u2019s more of a long-term training plan than a short-term one.\n2. Hiit is a great way to get in the best shape possible for your goals.\nHiit is also great for preventing injuries from happenings like a shoulder injury, knee injury, or ankle injury. The best way to get in the best shape possible for your goals is to hiit as much as you can and be consistent with your training.\n3. Hiit is also a great way to improve your cardio, and it may also help to lower your risk of getting sick.\nHiit is also a great way to improve your cardio, and it may also help to lower your risk of getting sick. Hiit is an excellent way to make sure you stay fit and healthy.\n4. Hiit is safe, and it is easy to learn.\nHiit is safe, and it is easy to learn. Hiit is a great workout for those who are not used to exercising. Hiit is also easy to perform because it is short.\n5. Hiit is a great way to build your endurance and strength.\nHiit is also a great way to build your endurance and strength. Hiit is also a great way to improve your overall fitness and muscle mass. Hiit is also a great way to increase your aerobic capacity and cardio performance. Hiit is also a great way to build and train your muscles.\nHiit is also a great way to burn calories.

Oceanography is concerned with the entire body of water on the Earth. In order to do this, this module requires us to consider the Earth in physical terms and how the ocean responds to these forces, to relate the chemistry to these physical forces and to relate the biology to the chemistry. We have to start with basic chemistry, physics and Earth processes to enable us to understand the basic concepts of oceanography. r PRIMARYHOME fog pressureactual HEALTH SERVICES - COMMISSIONING REGULATIONS FEDERATION POLICY AND SECURICY\nThis module explores the nature of contemporary health services research, how it differs from other kinds of research, its strengths and weaknesses and the context in which it evolves. r PRIMARYHOME fog pressureactual HEALTH SERVICES - COMMISSIONING REGULATIONS FEDERATION POLICY AND SECURICY\nEnvironmental factors are considered as the underlying causes of disease. As a result of this assumption the focus has been on developing new antibiotics and better means of sanitizing the environment with disinfectants. Disinfection of hospitals and health care facilities is not only required to prevent cross infection, but it is also required because there are many organisms which are resistant to antibiotics. With increase in resistance for antibiotics and increased focus on personal hygiene in the health care facilities, there is an increased interest to find alternative ways of disinfection.

It's been eight hours of hard work, and your shift just started back at eight o'clock. A doctor enters the room and announces that a patient's condition has suddenly worsened. You know how to administer most of the treatments given to this patient. But you've never dealt with this problem before. Your patient is a young teenager on bedrest with an illness that can sometimes cause the patient's heart to go out of rhythm. You've never seen this sort of heart problem before.\nThe doctor tells you he thinks something is wrong with the patient's heart -- that he has a problem called \"sick sinus syndrome.\" You're given no treatment plan, but the doctor asks you to continue everything you are doing and administer medicines as usual. The patient's heart rate seems to improve slightly. Meanwhile, the patient's blood pressure and breathing become more labored than normal. Your patient continues to become more and more confused and unable to focus.\n\"Is she okay?\" you ask, worried about the patient's condition. You tell the doctor what the patient is saying. He leaves his office but returns immediately. \"It's called 'electrical storms,'\" he replies, as he begins to write the chart. \"We'll give her more medication for the heart arrhythmia. This is a known side effect of a low blood pressure. But what can we do about the confusion and the disorientation?\"\nDuring the next few hours, the doctor and a pharmacist confer together. The patient is given medications that are in the pharmacist's \"recipe book.\" As she takes the medication, her heart rate returns to normal. But she's still disoriented and not improving. The doctor orders some more tests to determine what is causing the disorientation.\nAfter five more hours of work and more medications, the patient's condition becomes worse rather than better. \"Damn,\" the doctor says with frustration. Your patient becomes more and more confused, and breathing becomes increasingly difficult. You wonder if the patient will live through the rest of this shift. You watch as the patient's eyeballs begin to roll to the side of her head. The doctor tries to do something, but you're not sure what. The doctor calls for his team.\nSitting in a chair beside the patient, you look up at the doctor and ask if her blood pressure and heart rate can be normalized. She's still not responding, although her blood pressure and heart rate are higher than they've ever been. \"Damn,\" the doctor says. The doctor looks at the patient's chart and orders more tests. Then an EKG arrives; a nurse puts the electrodes on your patient. Blood is drawn for tests.\nNurses in hospitals, private offices, and clinics are trained to do important tasks in the medical environment.\nYour patient wakes up but is still confused. Her disorientation and difficulty breathing do not improve. But her blood pressure is fine, and her heart rate is also within a normal range. What on earth is going on? The doctor orders tests for thyroid conditions, diabetes, and even brain tumors. The doctor gives your patient a sedative to put her to sleep. An endoscopy -- a procedure in which a doctor looks inside the patient's body -- confirms that there are no problems in the patient's throat. Then the doctor announces that the patient's body and breathing seem to be responding well to her sleep.\nThe doctor then decides that your patient may be having \"hypoglycemic episodes,\" a sudden drop in blood glucose that can occur in diabetics. He orders the patient's blood to be continuously tested for the level of sugar. After a few hours, glucose levels seem to be increasing. But the patient's confusion and disorientation do not improve.\nYou watch as the nurse gives some medication that is supposed to raise the patient's sugar level. She calls for help as your patient's breathing becomes labored. Her oxygen level drops below the normal level for 10 seconds, and she's losing consciousness. Her heart rate is also below what's normal. Dozens of doctors and nurses enter the room with the EKG machine, looking for answers. The patient's blood sugar level is below the normal level again. Her heart rate increases just enough to register correctly again. But her breathing becomes more difficult.\nYou stand frozen outside the patient's room. Your mind is a jumble of questions and answers. You know that some of the medications given to your patient could cause problems within the patient's body. But what exactly is causing these problems?\nYou look at the patient's chart, which has now been turned into a disorganized mess. Her blood pressure, weight, sugar level, and heart rate have been written over and over on it. But where these numbers are written becomes confusing and hard to follow. Even the doctor's notes are a jumble of ideas: \"Possible hypothyroidism,\" \"Possible diabetes,\" \"Possible brain tumor,\" \"Possible low-dose aspirin,\" \"Possible allergies.\"\nAn hour later, the patient is awake, but her head is moving erratically. The doctor calls for another sedative. The drugs given to your patient can be addictive. It is unlikely that she will be given a good sleep-inducing medication. But the doctor wants your patient to be quiet and asleep so he can continue trying to figure out what's wrong with her. The doctor suggests that it's more likely that your patient is suffering from \"sleep-deprivation.\" But she does not respond to sleep-promoting medications.\nThe doctor takes his time evaluating the patient's situation. Then he places several electrodes on his hands and asks the nurse to attach them to the patient: \"He's asleep! Let's get these electrodes off real quick and ask all the doctors to discuss what we're seeing.\"\nThe doctor takes you aside and tells you to stop talking to doctors or nurses about the patient. After the conversation, you ask why he wants you to stop talking to the doctors. \"I don't trust what's written on the chart yet,\" he replies. \"I won't believe it until I see what we do with the patient.\"\nYou go back to the patient's room. She's staring at the ceiling. She moves her mouth, trying to speak and struggling to focus. You ask her to lie still and not say anything. She smiles at you, nods, and closes her eyes. Then she closes and opens them again.\nYou walk over to the patient's bed and lean in close to see her better. You can see her eyeballs moving. You wonder what could be blocking the electric pathway between her brain and her eyes. \"She's not getting enough oxygen or she is losing too much oxygen,\" a doctor says, looking at the patient on a computer screen connected to the patient by a ventilator. \"Is there a problem with the ventilator?\"\nYour patient is a real person with her own body. You're in her room, and you listen as doctors discuss their theories. How did you get here?\nWhen my mother had a heart condition when she was young in the 1970s, a doctor prescribed a drug to lower her blood pressure but warned my mother of several side effects that could occur. She told my mother that she might develop headaches and dizziness, for example. But she had no symptoms, so there was no reason to assume the drug was causing these problems. My mother didn't ask many questions about the drug, though, because she was being treated at a top hospital.\n\"The doctor's always right,\" she said to me. \"You should always listen to your doctor.\" Her doctor knew what was best, so she didn't question him. In turn, I never questioned any doctors I saw. Although I always had questions about what I was experiencing, how I was recovering from surgery, and how long I needed to be on medications, I didn't question any doctors or treatment plans.\nMy mother grew tired of doctors as the years passed, so when I called to ask questions, she'd tell me to \"go talk to your doctor.\" But I only rarely went to see doctors. In 2001, for example, I had to undergo two surgeries for two different problems with my heart -- anemia and an irregular heartbeat. During the first operation, I lost an immense amount of blood because of clotting issues. This led to anemia and another surgery to have blood transfusions.\nThen, in 2003, I developed another problem with my heart involving irregular palpitations. Every few years, I'd start noticing that my heart was racing -- so fast that I was having trouble breathing and I'd pass out.\nWhen I first noticed that I was having these \"palpitations,\" the people at work suggested that if I wanted to stop feeling the sudden heartbeats, I should stop smoking -- just as people often advised my mother to quit smoking when she was having a problem with her heart. But smoking was not the problem.\nAfter being sent home from work with palpitations in April 2003, I went to see two different cardiologists in New York City. They both ordered tests and told me to prepare for another surgery. \"You're having heart tests,\" they both told me. The cardiologists advised me to \"quit anything that will make my heart work harder.\"\nThe tests were all done, and I was told I could stop the tests and go home the next day. Then I started to notice my heart speeding up again. I was advised that my heart was probably healing from my last surgery in 2001. I had lost over 10 pounds after my second surgery, so when I started gaining back that weight and eating red meat, I was told I should stop -- even though I'd been a vegetarian for four years. \"I need to talk to someone about the medication I'm taking for my heart,\" I told them. \"It's making my heart beat fast.\" The cardiologists thought I should just stop taking one of the medications, so I wasn't told I had to undergo any more tests before my medications were changed or stopped altogether.\nSince then, I've started taking medication with more active ingredients -- medication that's more likely to \"trigger\" problems rather than prevent them. So nowadays, I take my heart medicine and forget about its side effects.\nBut I still don't ask questions. In fact, I don't believe what I really think. I still believe in the doctors. When things go wrong, I don't think there are any mistakes made. When I was 16 years old and was having abdominal pain and not going to toilet, my mother told me I needed an ultrasound. \"I'll see your doctor in three weeks,\" she told the doctor in his office. \"In three weeks, I'll know what's wrong with you and I'll be back to see you.\"\nThe doctor told her that an ultrasound was not necessary, since I had eaten something new, which was probably blocking my intestines. \"Go home and keep eating the same foods you've always eaten,\" he said. But my mother disagreed with him, so she kept me off that kind of food.\nI saw the doctor three weeks later, and by then my abdominal pains were so extreme that I was having to stay awake in a chair in the family room while my mother slept in the bedroom. My mother wanted me to \"go under the doctor's care\" again if the problem was still bothering me. So I went to the bathroom and told my mother I needed to go and would be back. But I never came back, so she followed me to the bathroom down the hall. I couldn't move. The pressure was so immense that I had to sit still and not move, or I would have to rush to the bathroom. I was having difficulty breathing and speaking.\nMy mother asked me if I needed a doctor or if I was \"okay.\" I told her that I hadn't finished. She got scared when I told her how I felt -- how I \"couldn't move.\" I'd never told her what it felt like for me to be constipated like that. My mother called the doctor immediately.\nAnd that was my third or fourth \"appointment\" with the doctor. I was only 16 years old, and I could not have left the living room because the pressure on my abdomen was so intense. I didn't understand that my mother wasn't listening to me. I didn't understand that the doctor wasn't listening to my mother. I knew that something was wrong, but I always believed what the doctor told me.\nIn the operating room, I had a \"surgery\" on my stomach to \"fix\" the problem. The doctor told my mother that I needed an incision in my stomach for another \"operation.\" \"It will be a minor operation,\" he told her, even though he was \"putting me to sleep.\"\nI had another surgery on my colon when my mother saw something on the endoscopy exam that looked like a \"strangulating blood clot.\" I was diagnosed with diverticulitis.\nBut I still don't question doctors. In fact, I rarely leave them and rarely see any of them again. When I do go to a doctor, I simply get the information I need. And if I don't ask when I have questions, I don't get any information. If I don't ask, \"Can you tell me what my medications are for?\" then I'll not know whether the medications I'm taking are helping me or are the cause of all the new problems that I'm having.\nI'll not know if I have a problem that needs to be treated. I won't even know if I'm doing things that will help prevent and cure illnesses in a different area -- a different part of my body. I might ask questions like, \"Will medications I take now stop my heart from beating fast?\" And the doctor might answer, \"We can't know for certain, but our medicine should be okay.\" But how will I know what I'm taking is actually working or that I will even be using medications for years and years to come without knowing how they're affecting the next area of my body? How can I ask doctors to explain their procedures and why they think their tests are right?\nHow can you find a job with the medical information technology and systems you will learn through these resources?\nIf you have a good grasp of math and the ability to work with computerized calculations, you will need to prepare for the job market by finding a school that will give you the training and practical experience you'll need not just in math but for working with computer programs as well. Here is a list of schools you can start with.\nThese schools are not affiliated with and/or cannot recommend any particular career path.\n\"Certification is offered through the National Healthcareer Association (NHA), Institute of Healthcare Administrators (IHCA) and the National Certification Board (NCB\") -- the three NAMSS certifying bodies. The NHA and the IHCA are industry associations, whereas the NCB is a certification organization formed by NAMSS specifically to address the need for special industry certification. All employers have the right to determine who receives their approval for an NAMSS Certification. However, to be considered eligible for NAMSS Certification, you must have one year under your belt in medical billing and or/coding, have at least six months experience working in your chosen field and hold a high school diploma or GED. Both programs are considered equal to the Certification Exam offered by NAMSS.\nSome of those who are looking for a career change -- like retirees -- might not need a certificate for the job search. In contrast, college-educated medical professionals will likely need some kind of certificate to land even an entry-level position. This means that finding a school that offers degrees as well as certificate programs is a must.\n\"The program's curriculum includes the following skills: healthcare delivery, health services and financial management, medical records, medical terminology, and medical billing.

This leads to anemia, in which the body does not have enough red blood cells to get the oxygen it needs.\nAcid Reflux \u2013 People with sleep apnea often have a hitch in their jaw that forces their throat upward, which may lead to reflux of stomach acids into the esophagus and lungs.\nHypertension \u2013 Sleep apnea can cause elevated blood pressure, which may also indicate an underlying heart condition or blood vessel disease.\nUntreated sleep apnea can cause other health problems. These\nHow do you treat sleep apnea?\nA: In order to treat sleep apnea, you will need to have your doctor prescribe a CPAP machine. This is a device that connects the patients face with an air compressor through tubes and provides pressurized air through these tubes. If not treated, sleep apnea can cause death by suffocation from sleeping on the floor. This article will discuss the symptoms, causes and treatment options associated with sleep apnea.\nWhat is the cause of breathing problems when sleeping?\nA: There are many potential causes of breathing problems when sleeping. A common one is a condition called Sleep Apnea, which prevents people from inhaling during their REM cycles. This can lead to a lack of oxygen, or decreased sleep, if you are an individual with sleep apnea then its recommended that you consult your physician for further help.\nHow can I not feel suffocated at night?\nA: One of the most common problems is sleep apnea. Some people have this while theyre asleep, which sounds like it would be no problem- but it can actually be life-threatening to the person who suffocates. This happens because the brain doesnt get enough oxygenated air and it tries to compensate for that by taking a breath every few seconds and filling its lungs with more carbon dioxide than oxygen, which produces a feeling like suffocation even though youre awake! Its important to note that if youre experiencing any symptoms like this, talk with your doctor because they may be able to diagnose an underlying health issue like this one.\nIs snoring a life-threatening condition?\nA: Snoring is a common condition, but its not life-threatening. You may be tired, uncomfortable, or even have nightmares, but this shouldnt lead to serious harm. However, sleep apnea (which causes people to stop breathing for short periods) does pose a serious risk for your health. Check out this article to learn more about snoring vs sleep apnea!\nWhat is the most common cause of sleep apnea?\nA: The most common cause of sleep apnea is a condition called Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB). This disorder can be caused by a number of things- everything from narcolepsy to obesity. Sleep apnea is often found in people with larger bodies and those who snore regularly.\nA: In order to sleep, you need to be able to fall asleep. This is not always true for everyone but its important that you do your very best to avoid things that could interfere with this process. You may have to use earplugs or white noise machines, and even medication if needed!\nA: Sleep apnea is a condition in which the breathing of an individual stops or becomes labored. This can happen when someone stops breathing for more than 10 seconds, or when they are awake and have difficulty going back to sleep.\nDoes losing weight improve sleep apnea?\nA: The short answer is that it usually doesnt. Sleep apnea is a condition in which people stop breathing for an extended period of time, usually for more than 10 seconds. If youre overweight, this can make your sleep apnea worse.\nWhat causes the most sleep apnea?\nA: Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that affects the quality of your sleep. People with this type of condition tend to stop breathing while theyre asleep, leading to snoring, dry mouth and other symptoms. It\u2019s difficult to determine what causes this condition, because its often the result of a combination of factors including genetics, sleep habits and environmental factors.\nA: Sleep Apnea is a condition that can be caused by many factors, and it also has some other symptoms. The most common ones are feeling dizzy or confused, having a higher risk of cancer, and having an increased risk for heart disease. Some people experience mood swings with sleep apnea, such as depression and anxiety.\nWhat are the signs of sleep apnea in women?\nA: Sleep apnea is a condition that can be deadly if left untreated. There are many signs of sleep apnea in women which may be more pronounced than those found in men.\nPrevPreviousWhat causes coughing and chest pain in early pregnancy?\nNextDoes coughing mean early pregnancy?Next", "num_tokens_generated": 2344, "OGF": 0.572265625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 55.484691858291626, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 650, "chunk_index": 10, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Please see my reply below.\nThe mockingbird is often associated with innocent, unassuming creatures that are vulnerable or powerless to protect themselves from harm. In the novel, the mockingbird symbolizes the values of equality, kindness, and innocence, as well as the idea that life is unfair. For example, the character Atticus Finch defends a Black man (Tom Robinson) who is wrongfully accused of rape and is convicted through a racist justice system. Atticus represents the true meaning of the mockingbird in the novel by standing up for what is right and fighting for what he believes in, even when it seems impossible to win. The mockingbird is a symbol of the values that are at the heart of the novel and is a reminder that these values are threatened by unjust and unfair practices in society.\nThe mockingbird also represents the themes of the novel, such as racism, inequality, and injustice. The character Atticus Finch is a representation of the values that the mockingbird stands for, and his actions in defending the victim against the unfair justice system are a representation of the character\u2019s beliefs. Furthermore, the injustice that Tom Robinson faces shows how racism and inequality can lead to unfairness and unjust practices in society, which reflects the themes of the novel.\nIn summary, the mockingbird in the novel is a symbol of the values that the characters represent and is a metaphor for their struggles and the struggles of society against the injustice that they face. The theme of the novel is highlighted as an important element that helps to illustrate themes and events throughout the course of the story. In short, I think that the mockingbird is a powerful symbol in the novel that is used to convey the themes and events that are central to the story. I hope this was helpful to you! Please feel free to ask for a better explanation, and I will be happy to provide one.\nPrevPreviousHow Is The Framing Of Scarlett and Melanie In \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d Contrasted To That Of Aunt Sissy?

The Anglo-American cultural empires of the New World are being built and strengthened.\nThe Anglophonic world today is the \"first globalized world. It's not an American world.

The new age in human history is not a new era or an age in which a new era is beginning, an era, a renaissance or a revival. The new age is the end of old ages and the coming of a new age of democratic world order.\nThe democratic world order is not a new era, an age or renaissance. For me, the old age is over, but the new age begins. The new age is the end of old ages and the coming of a new age of democratic world order.\nA new era began with the revolution in India in 1947.

When my father took me for a ride in his helicopter, I was just 15 years old. This was in the year 1972, when the Indo- Pak war was at its peak. We were flying from Amritsar in Northern India to Srinagar, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, (called PoK). I was excited to fly in a helicopter for the first time.\nThe weather was very cool, as the nights in that region were usually cold. Since this was a military helicopter, no permission was needed from the Civil Aviation Authority in India to fly. No one seemed to notice us as our helicopter took off and then flew through the dark sky. As we came close to Srinagar, lights below started appearing like a bunch of jewels, shining in the night. Soon after we landed in Srinagar, we were escorted to a hotel by some soldiers.\nThen we started the business part of our trip. The helicopter picked up about 50 of us in the city of Srinagar, and flew us to PoK, and dropped us in a very remote area near the border with Punjab. When I looked out of the aircraft, I saw a large mountain range looming in front of me. We were in for a wild night, and a very cold one. In the morning we started moving over the snow covered mountain trail. But because it was summer, that meant there were no heavy snowdrifts.\nThe only risk was crossing crevasses that were filled with snow, which would make our journey dangerous. As we moved forward, suddenly, the Pakistani army helicopters arrived, led by the famous General Akbar, and also some Indian troops. The air combat started when their helicopter tried to forcefully bring us down. They were firing from one side, and then, two F16 fighter jets came in and attacked us from the other end. All of a sudden their aircraft disappeared in a cloud of smoke as the two combatants exchanged shots.\nThen as we started moving, an Indian jet came out of nowhere and scrambled us. The next day, we returned, and this was all it cost us: one fighter jet from the Indian side, one F16 from the Pakistani, and one helicopter each. I was really scared when I saw that the helicopter, into which my father and I were travelling, had a hole in its tail, which was caused by our own jets. No one was injured, as we managed to get out before anything happened.\nIn spite of such a scary experience, I enjoyed it so much. My father gave me the nickname of \u201cWon\u2019t Hunt!\u201d whenever I travelled with him. It was just another day in a life that I love so much. \u201cHouse of Commons\u201d. Source. https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/house-of-commons-committees. All Rights Reserved. The House of Commons, also known as Westminster, is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, with members chosen through an election held every five years.\nTo be a member of the UK Parliament, you need to be 18 years old, a British citizen and on the electoral roll. Only this time, I will let her decide. The House meets on a daily basis during the week at the Palace of Westminster in London, but meetings are less frequent during August.\nParliament is also in session during the recess. Committees form part of the process of creating a law. Most committee work is done in private. The Public Bills Committee of each of Parliament\u2019s Houses considers bills, and makes recommendations on their final form.\nCommittees also review legislation prepared by Government ministries. A Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Parliamentary Clerk represent the House of Commons of the UK, and serve as its chief administrative officer. It is possible to have committee meetings away from the Palace of Westminster. For example, the House of Commons Committees on Climate Change and on the Digital Economy, meet in Portcullis House \u2013 adjacent to Westminster.\nCommittee business is governed by Standing Orders \u2013 or the formal rules of procedure \u2013 of the UK Parliament. Parliamentary Committees help Members to exercise scrutiny and oversight. For example, they review the impact of legislation on specific parts of society, the economy and the environment. Most committees will examine a draft bill before it is introduced in the House of Commons, and will discuss its likely success once it has passed through Parliament.\nParliamentary committees are also involved in scrutinising Government departments and other bodies, including the BBC. For more information on committees, see parliamentary. uk/about/how/mpsandlords.html. You can also find a list of current committee members on the same website. Parliament\u2019s business is largely organised to enable MPs to be represented on a committee.\nHowever, Members may only participate in two committees at a time. According to Standing Orders, a committee has 20 members and its size is determined by the composition of the House of Commons. It must have 11 MPs from the House of Commons, and 9 from the House of Lords.\nA \u201cmajority party\u201d is the party with the most members. The Government\u2019s parliamentary strategy is not the same for all committees, and the role of minor parliamentary parties is not so obvious in the UK. To be a member of a committee, you must be a member of the House of Commons.\nThe number of committee members is proportional to the size of the House, and committee membership is proportional to the size of the parties, so committee membership is proportional to the major parties. There is no set ratio between committee members from each party.\nAs a member of the House of Commons, you may seek to serve on an official parliamentary committee, or on a committee of an official party, or in a private committee. Standards in public life are considered by Parliamentary Committees, and in 2007 a joint committee of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords established the standards in public life review process which established the basis for current principles of public life. The Code of Conduct of Members of the House of Commons is based on these principles, but members are not obliged to observe them if they wish.\nThe Code of Conduct is used as the basis of a member expenses scandal in 2009, which led to a parliamentary enquiry that resulted in the establishment of a parliamentary watchdog. In 2014, the report of the committee on privileges, published in the Daily Mail, concluded that a parliamentary \u201ccode of conduct\u201d should be set up for MPs to ensure that their financial interests are properly managed and declared. In 2016, a parliamentary committee of the House of Commons concluded that a parliamentary code of conduct would not have prevented the \u201cExpenses scandal\u201d. The report concluded that a voluntary code would have \u201ca profound effect on the public\u2019s perception of MPs, and would inevitably have a significant negative impact on relations between the House and the House of Lords\u201d.\nCommittees and committee Chairs The committee is made up of ministers and parliamentarians who have specific areas of expertise.

All that is solid melts into air by the artists Aaron Bastani and Andrew Goffey, 2009, collection: UCL. 1756 is the year when the famous novel Gulliver\u2019s Travels by Johnathan Swift was published. 2. Fragments of Dreams by Zahid Mubarak, 2004, collection: UCL. The collection of UCL Art Museum consists of a few hundred artworks. 3. The Caterpillar and Butterfly, 2013, collection: UCL Art Museum The exhibition I\u2019m working with is a project titled The World is Flat, The Earth is Squashed, which has been developed by a collective called NUAC. The exhibition opens with an installation by Gareth Cadwallader called The Caterpillar and the Butterfly, in which there is a giant caterpillar which turns itself into a butterfly. It\u2019s a surreal experience when you are in it, which is part of why I like the piece so much. When I visited the exhibition and was in the butterfly, I could feel the pressure and the weight of the butterfly, which gave the feeling of a struggle of trying to become a human being. But, because it is a butterfly and light and airy at the same time, the message came across of trying to be free as humans are in some respects, trying to find a way to break free from things that are holding us down. The piece relates to what Swift said in his writings and the essence of 1756 is that the world is in a state of chaos. Also a lot of the exhibition refers to the chaotic times we are living through\nwith Trump coming into power and Brexit, which relates to 1756. 4. I Am Not A Bird, 2018, collection: NUAC The title of the exhibition, The World is Flat, The Earth is Squashed, comes from the book I Am Not A Bird by Aaron Bastani and Andrew Goffey. It is a book which features in the exhibition and refers to the chaotic times we are living in. I have chosen to use the exhibition for the basis of this project because I was captivated by the messages it was putting out and how it related to the chaotic times we live in. I was very excited to work with an exhibition about which I already knew so much because I am fascinated by the themes that relate to the times we live in and the themes in the work. 5. 100 Things Wrong with Society Today, 2018, collection: NUAC The book I Am Not A Bird is about creating a better version of society, where women can be equal to men and people can treat each other with more respect. The project is based on the themes in the exhibition and in 100 Things Wrong With Society Now, which the artists refer to in the book I Am Not A Bird. One hundred things that are the cause of problems in society today and how to solve them. These are things\nlike mental health, LGBTQ+ issues, politics, and more. Another work in the book and the exhibition which I chose is The Caterpillar and the Butterfly, by Gareth Cadwallader. In The Caterpillar and the Butterfly, the butterfly is an all-seeing, all-knowing thing which observes all that is around it and it learns so much. I found this fascinating and it\u2019s one of his concepts that resonates with me. I want to work on creating something that takes into account the themes I mentioned before and the feelings expressed by the artists. I also think the artists are very interested in the idea of art and how it can bring about a lot of change in society. 6. Gulliver as a child, 2014, collection: UCL Art Museum As with a lot of museum exhibitions, the exhibition does use a lot of traditional painting methods, which I found interesting. I want to use oil painting to explore this and see how I can create something which is a painting that looks like a painting but also a contemporary work of art which is also a modern-day painting. If we see the book from the perspective of a work of art, what elements of traditional art do we see in the book, such as composition, shapes and colours? I wanted to work on making these things more traditional to create a painting related to the themes in the book, I Am Not A Bird. I also want to create something which is a painting and at the same\ntime a contemporary work of art. The work would be about the themes mentioned before and also the chaotic times we live in at the moment. I chose to work on painting because I believe it gives the artwork an old-fashioned, classical feel, which then relates it to the classical times we often read about and the works created by authors in those times. 7. Gulliver in the Lilliputian Lands by Samuel Scott, 1726, collection: UCL Art Museum I wanted to try and create a painting that makes people feel like they are in the painting at the same time as making them question what it is they are seeing. I think the painting also has an element of storytelling which is interesting to explore and is related to the theme in I Am Not A Bird that storytelling is so important and how it can bring people closer together. The painting is also very traditional and I like using traditional means to make something contemporary at the same time. The painting is also about social injustice and I think, by combining all these elements in one painting, I can create something that is very relevant to society at the moment and the times we live in. 8. Gulliver as a giant, 2008, collection: UCL Art Museum Another work I want to look at creating a work of art about is Gulliver in the Lilliputian Lands by Samuel Scott. In the book and in the exhibition, there is a lot of discussion about different societies, the different peoples of the world, and what things make a civilised society. A lot of\ndiscussion is around money and poverty levels and it makes you question whether a wealthy society necessarily needs to be a socially stable one. We live in a time when poverty levels are increasing and there are more people in dire circumstances, especially in the UK, yet there is lots of emphasis on wealth and people who have the most money being seen as the most successful. This relates to the themes in I Am Not A Bird and I want to create something that makes people question their assumptions on what is actually important. 9. Gulliver arrives in Lilliput, 1870, collection: UCL Art Museum Gulliver as a giant in the exhibition has an interesting element of reality which intrigues me so much, so this leads me to something the artists in the exhibition are also interested in, which in the book and in the exhibition, is a society which makes it possible for it to function. Many of the things in society are actually quite simple to imagine. If there was no war, if people had a better understanding of each other, and a lot of other things, there would be a more justifiable society. I want to create something which imagines this and to do so with a traditional element which is linked to the times we live in and the exhibition. There is so much discussion about the idea of society. It\u2019s strange how it\u2019s really not that complicated to imagine if everyone was equal and people actually took the time to really get to know each other. I am interested in creating something that really reflects what society is telling us\nto think and to imagine and to really encourage people to really think outside of the box which they are often told to do. 10. Gareth Cadwallader and Aaron Bastani\n11. The Mothers Day painting, 2013, collection: NUAC A painting which is also in the exhibition I am really interested in is The Mothers Day painting by Gareth Cadwallader. It explores the themes of social media and technology. It is called selfies, a new word for self-portraits, which I think is super interesting and relevant to the chaotic times we live in. There are so many debates about what we should and shouldn\u2019t say, or how we should behave, especially on social media. The artist also refers to other artists like Andy Warhol and Duchamp, which I am also interested in examining, as well as making my own ideas about how society can also be reflected in art. The painting references the 1960s, the beginning of the \u2018new age of technology\u2019 and the emerging trends of modern culture, so to think about these in the context of our own lives today and their implications is something that fascinates me. It is about the notion of people taking selfies every day, in the same way, for example, they post on Instagram, showing off the things they have bought and worn. This brings to the surface the idea that we show off social media and social media tells us what we should be wearing and what we should be doing every day. I am interested in how selfies relate to our contemporary world. This painting references these themes and\nthe idea of how these things relate to the classical world and the classical period of time when these authors wrote. I want to find new ways to explore these themes and concepts. 12. Sculpture I Am Not A Bird, 2015, collection: NUAC My work would be based on these themes and also create something that is made in the classical\nway. It would have something traditional to do with it, like a still life painting, which I think represents reality. The piece reflects society and the issues that there are to deal with in a classical way, and also I want to make it feel contemporary. My work would be in a sense contemporary and not traditional and reflect current trends and ideas in a classical way. I will be creating a classical painting in the style of a still life painting which will include other items, such as a piece of metal with the words \u2018Love is not a business\u2019 printed on it. I think it would be really interesting to explore this classic style of painting, but with an item which is used in our society today and which speaks about our love life and social media. 13. Video art, 2009, collection: UCL Art Museum The title of this piece, The Caterpillar and the Butterfly, relates to the idea that you have to go through suffering before you can become something and that there are struggles that we have to go through to ultimately create something better. The piece represents the chaotic times we are living in. The chaos is a feeling which is almost a physical feeling in our time, but I don\u2019t think people recognise quite how much that is the case. We have to recognise and empathise with our feelings\nat a time when there are chaotic circumstances to deal with. I think it will be really interesting to create something which relates to this piece. Another piece which has elements that relate to the things I want to put into my painting is one by Andrew Goffey, called Fragments of Dreams. It is about a man sleeping and his dreams and what it means to be human. It is a painting which represents a lot of the ideas in the exhibition about being human which I am interested in and want to explore. The painting is about a dream and is about the themes of sleep and insomnia. It also brings to light the struggle of being human, and that struggle can be found in different ways, through music, through paintings, and in other artworks. I think it is really fascinating to try and express what it means to be human and what that involves. My work would want to explore the struggle that comes through the modern world, but also our emotions. 14. Lecture by Gareth Cadwallader, 2017, collection: NUAC One event in the exhibition which I think is really important is a series of lectures which have been organised about different social issues by Gareth Cadwallader. There was a lecture about poverty, a lecture about the environment, a lecture about LGBTQ+ issues and the struggle women face. I want to explore these and create something that is based on these lectures. They are so important to society and really highlight the importance of trying to change society for the better.\nGareth is a fantastic lecturer and I think his lectures are really important to explore. I want to create something that focuses on these issues and really brings to life the chaos we face, the chaos of trying to survive with so many other people on the planet. It could be something which really brings to life the struggle that people feel through the modern world. I am interested in creating something that expresses these feelings and which then expresses the issues in the book I Am Not A Bird. Hopefully it will really encourage people to think about how society operates. The book is about the chaos of trying to change social injustices in society. It\u2019s a reflection of the chaos in which we live and the chaotic times we live in. 15. The book Gulliver's Travels is 1756, collection: UCL Art Museum One thing I am inspired by in the exhibition is how it is all about the book Gulliver\u2019s Travels which is interesting to explore. The book is the focus of the exhibition and the focus of my work, which is quite something I think, because it often happens that contemporary work isn\u2019t about classical texts. In exploring classical texts and the themes of the book, Gulliver\u2019s Travels, and how they relate to the chaotic times we live in, I also want to explore if we can do anything to change these things, and if we can create change from something which is related to classical times. In creating something that has a modern\nappeal to it, it makes sense to start with what is classical. I think something that is interesting about this is that a lot of the themes are still the same, they can be seen in today\u2019s society. In the times when these writers wrote, all their thoughts and observations were related to the society we saw throughout that time. We still have so many of the same issues today and it\u2019s fascinating to explore how these writers captured such similar feelings. 16. The exhibition uses books that are related to the exhibition Aaron Bastani and Gareth Cadwallader, 2018, collection: UCL Art Museum It\u2019s not just the book that is of interest to me. I am very interested in the works of these incredibly clever and intelligent minds that they have created and I want to explore how I can create something that tries to relate to this in a contemporary way. They create artworks and these pieces of work really interest me, because I want to explore in my own artwork how can I create something that tries to relate to the feelings and thoughts of an artist. I want to explore how to create something that is classically based which can also have something modern about it and relate to what happens now in the world. 17. Gulliver, The Artist, 2019, collection: NUAC One of the works I am thinking about creating is a piece inspired by the book I Am Not A Bird, which is about Gulliver. The book and the exhibition is about the exploration of people and their feelings and how\nthey see what is going on and the difficulties they have. It\u2019s about how people see and understand each other and how we can improve our feelings. There is the idea of love, and I think that concept that it is all connected to the idea of trying to see ourselves in relation to our feelings and what we are doing. It\u2019s about how we see ourselves in relation to other people and other things. I want to try and think from the perspective of Gulliver who is Gulliver, the artist and Gulliver as the artist, as well as Gulliver as a person and a character in a book. I am not sure quite what style to use in this work, but I want to try and create an image of Gulliver which shows him as an artist. There is the idea of Gulliver painting himself. How did he see himself as a person and what role did he play in the artwork, how did it change over the story? It is about how people are connected to this story and to Gulliver as a person and how we see people as people. I think it would be really interesting to explore one of my main questions of how we look at art, how it affects us, and how we feel when we look at art. These questions are things I want to explore myself with the exhibition and my own work. Art is so often about the way that people feel and it is one of the most important things about art. I am interested in how I am going to show and express that. It is also an interesting question because sometimes there are many kinds of art and you can\u2019t always define precisely what something is and where it sits.\nLow income housing 27 28 2 Lizzie Clarke\nThe concept of home is central to being human. In 2019 we have an unprecedented housing crisis, and low income housing is especially important to addressing the shortcomings of this. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around how far \u2018low income housing\u2019 should go. Should it be reserved for homeless and at risk of homelessness people? And if so, should this be managed entirely through the state? In the UK, as of March 2017 we have 630,000 homeless people and more than 1 million more in danger of losing their homes. In a time of great change and uncertainty, it can be stressful in our own lives to consider how we would have made a more secure choice, given the knowledge and resources available to us today. How do we ensure our right to a home for ourselves from the start? This essay argues that in tackling the problem from the beginning, we can make better choices, with more options and choices.\nIn 2011, 4,131 children in England were counted as homeless and living in temporary accommodation. That number tripled to 12,747 in 2019.

If the artists want the painting to go on smoothly they use acrylic-based mediums.\n\nWhat is the acrylic paints\u2019 water soluble element?\n\nAcrylic paints are water-soluble and the artist can easily wash the paint away using a water sponge.\n\nHow to use acrylic paints?\n\nBefore painting or creating an artwork, put down an acrylic-based medium such as liquid acrylic medium, gluco liquid acrylics medium (medium in liquid form that you mix into paint tube), or acrylic gel medium.\n\nWhat is the water-soluble aspect of acrylics?\n\nAcrylics are water-soluble, which means they can be washed away with water.\n\nHow to thin the acrylic paints?\n\nAcrylic paints can be thinned with water, so you can create your own water-based acrylic paint by diluting acrylic paint with water.\n\nWhat is the difference between watercolor paints and acrylic paints?\n\nWatercolor paint does not require a separate medium, such as turpentine or white spirit, as would be needed for many oils and acrylics. Watercolor paints can be easily washed off of the surface of a page with a clean wet cloth. It is also worth noting that watercolor paint tends to stay wet for a more extended period of time.\n\nWhich are best beginner paints for kids?\n\nFor any crafting projects, the first thing you should do after buying the tools is to acquire the most suitable paints. Most of the art and craft materials that can be bought in traditional retail outlets such as grocery stores and department shops are not suitable for use for painting, and should not be used. Kids should use only watercolors and acrylic paints for their art projects.\n\nIn art and craft projects, the first thing you should do after buying your craft supplies is buying the paint. Most of the art and craft materials that can be purchased in grocery stores, department stores and other traditional retail outlets are not suitable for painting. You should not use such materials, but acquire only pure, 100% pure acrylic paints and watercolors for your art projects.\n\nWhat to do if the acrylic paints are too thick and not spreading well?\n\nAcrylic paints can be thinned with water, so you can create your own water-based acrylic paint by diluting acrylic paint with water.\n\nWhat to do if the acrylic paints are too watery and not moving well?\n\nIf the acrylic paint is too watery it will not flow properly and you will not be able to get the right effect. To thicken the paint, you should add just enough turpentine to achieve the desired consistency. Always remember that you should not add more than 2% of the paint to dissolve in turpentine. If you add too much turpentine, the paint viscosity will be unsuitable for use and the paint will dry on the surface too quickly.\n\nWhat is the correct way to apply a paint color to a glass surface?\n\nThe first step in painting a glass surface requires painting the back of the object with an acrylic paint with mediums such as gouache in a coloring pencil.\nWhen the first layer is dry, you can apply a second coat of the color. When the paint dries, you will see that you will be able to see through it. In order to avoid the appearance of a clear layer, you can use a sponge and a little water to clean the paint off the surface. The sponge should be damp, but not wet.\n\nWhen using an acrylic medium in a coloring pencil on the back, you will be able to apply the paint to the front of the object with a paintbrush. You will need to use the paintbrush to apply the paint to the front of the window with an even stroke. This step makes the paint layer look as if it has been painted on the back of the object.\n\nWhat are the three main purposes of painting in oils mediums?\n\n\nDrying out or drying out a color\nHolding a layer of paint to the top of acrylics of aculor thickeninga\n\nHow to create an oil painting?\nChoose a canvasChooil pigmentChooil color to a pigmentChoose a surfacePick a pigment and how to hold.\n\nChoose the use of oil paintings that do acry oil mediums in watercolor paintings\n\nChoose the paint films.\n\nChoose theoil paintingsChoose a color films have been madeo films thathave of color films.\nChoose the correct use of the correct painting of mediums that are oils.\n\nWhat is color to createChoose to oil painting is paintings that creates the correct?", "num_tokens_generated": 4256, "OGF": 1.0390625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 107.77053499221802, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 662, "chunk_index": 10, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

All these changes have resulted in a vast dislocation of the economy in terms of production activities, employment and trade. The result is that workers, businesses and economies, everywhere will be continuously facing the challenge of change. In the South African economy, for instance, we currently experience very high unemployment, which is not the least because of the high rate of structural and sectoral transformations in the economy. However, structural adjustment does not mean only the need to adjust our production capacity to meet demand for increased exports and other imports. It also means the continual need to adjust and adapt to the changing expectations of workers.\nWorkers in some countries are complaining about their working conditions and the lack of job satisfaction. They want better pay and working conditions and want more freedom and dignity at their work places. The traditional business/industry/labour relations are no longer adequate for the challenges we face, and workers, entrepreneurs and governments need to cooperate within new partnership frameworks, while maintaining a sense of fairness and equity. The workplace is the place where all these challenges need to be responded to. How can a company address a fast-changing world through HRM? HRM plays a vital role in assisting any organisation to cope with changes through facilitating organisational learning and innovation. There are a number of ways in which HRM can deal with change inside your organisation: \u2022\nEvaluate your organisation\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in terms of its capacity to adapt to change. This process also needs to provide insight into change processes currently occurring inside different departments, functions and levels of the organisation. For example, many organisations focus on the external environment and have difficulty dealing with internal pressures to change. In such a scenario, HRM can help to facilitate open communication with a view to developing a shared vision of the organisation\u2019s strengths, current and future roles, and what needs to be done to ensure a successful change strategy. Assist the organisation\u2019s executive team and senior managers to rethink the organisation\u2019s core functions \u2013 its products and services and how these connect with its customers and other key stakeholders. Facilitate strategic planning discussions among the executive team, as well as among team leaders throughout the organisation. Explore opportunities to align human capital development interventions with the needs and wants of the new customers, competitors, industry and the community.\nHRM is now called upon to reexamine traditional ideas about work and productivity in the context of new technologies and emerging changes in the roles of women and men. 8.1 Workplace changes\nThe world about us has changed dramatically in recent decades. Technological changes, coupled with globalisation processes, have resulted in the rapid restructuring, resizing and relocation of businesses. In the South African context, we have experienced very high unemployment rates over a long period. These rates are not the least due to the restructuring and transformation of production and employment opportunities in an economy that was based on the mining of mineral resources for export to mainly global markets. However, restructuring does not only mean restructuring for the short term. It also means the continual adaptation to the changing needs of workers and businesses. In turn, employees need to adapt to the changing economic framework and the demand put on them to adapt.\n8.1.1 Increased job mobility\nThe result is that, in the new environment, employees will be required to constantly adapt and adjust their skills, knowledge and competencies to changing market needs. HRM will play an important role in facilitating organisations to restructure workforces to allow for the dynamic adaptability that is required in the knowledge-based economy.\nThe idea of the job-for-life contract with employers has become an antiquated concept (Hirsch and Rothbard, 2000:13). Most employees nowadays can expect a career spanning many different organisations and employers. We have moved from \u2018job security\u2019 to \u2018career mobility\u2019. This implies that employees now need to be more mobile both from a social and an economic perspective (Von Meding and Rothschild, 2000:131). These changes also affect how companies treat their employees and how these employees\u2019 relationships with companies are managed. With an increasing level of worker mobility and job change, employees will be faced with increasing periods of joblessness. For companies, these increased job mobility levels mean an increase in the number of people who become employed and then leave before they are able to be sufficiently groomed by them. Companies will need to ensure that they develop their human capital base in a more dynamic and flexible way.\nEmployers have to make certain commitments in terms of human capital development, but these commitments can only be sustained if employers have stable labour forces and employment conditions. Job security, in particular, needs to be a commitment both from the employee-side and from the employer-side. Thus, many companies will have to find more appropriate ways of dealing with job insecurity that emerges in the dynamic context experienced by them. In the past organisations could depend on loyal employees to create long-term employee-organisation relationships. Companies would then try to manage these relationships through a process of building commitment (and even dependence) to the organisation.\nIn the dynamic environment of today\u2019s labour market, loyalty is not as important a concept to HRM managers and line managers. Workers are becoming more mobile, and companies are struggling to retain committed employees through traditional methods. This creates a new environment with new challenges \u2013 one where companies have to consider their \u2018social contract with the employees\u2019, the relationship contract between a company and the employees that reflects how both the company and the employees perceive the company to treat them. There are many forms of such social contracts, which can be found in different contexts, from traditional work environments to different types of \u2018workforce relationship\u2019 environments.\n8.1.2 Organisational commitment and organisational citizenship\nCompanies will not thrive in the age of new technologies and changing consumer demands if they cannot attract and retain the best available workers. The problem for companies is that the best employees, if not trained and developed, will jump to other employers. This will affect the organisational commitment of the organisation as well as the organisational citizenship behaviour of employees. Organisational commitment refers to the extent to which employees\u2019 job attitudes are consistent with the job performance of an organisation (Meier, 1978: 244). Many scholars (e.g., Meyer and Allen, 1997) have identified the need to further investigate the concept of organisational commitment. These ideas are being challenged by recent findings and emerging theories, for example, about the role that organisational behaviour plays in helping to increase organisational commitment (e.g., Goggin et al., 2002:45).\nIn the new business environment, employees will be required to take on a wide range of new roles, including the role of consultants/advisers/partners, the role of supplier and the role of competitor. While each of these roles could imply the possibility of organisational citizenship behaviour, these relationships will not be the typical ones created inside an organisation. For employees in these new roles to develop organisational commitment, they will need to see the impact of their behaviour inside the organisation.\n8.1.3 Work/life balancing\nMany companies are struggling to attract the best employees and then to retain them for a long time. This problem emerges because all companies are now faced with the need to adopt a \u2018socially responsible approach\u2019 to human resource management, in order to fulfil their strategic human resource management functions. A socially responsible approach is one in which the organisation: \u2022\nTakes into consideration all stakeholder interests to ensure that employees, suppliers, consumers, financial backers, communities and the environment are protected, supported or maintained.\nMakes use of all stakeholder information provided, as a basis for the development of a corporate strategy or policy.\nInvolves stakeholders at various stages in the development, evaluation and implementation of policy (McShane, 1991).\nThe South African government has identified the \u2018family and work place\u2019 as one of the key \u2018pillars\u2019 in promoting social cohesion, economic growth and reducing social inequalities (Department of Labour, 2000: 12).\nThe work environment has changed dramatically over the past decade. Today more than ever, the workplace has become a site of multiple stresses related to people\u2019s lives as a whole. Not only are they challenged by the demands placed on them by work, but, as was mentioned above, they are also challenged by the rapid changes and the stress within the family (e.g. the changing role of women and men). To support work/life balance (WLB) and work-life integration in the workplace, the Employment Equity Act (1998) requires employers to identify the various needs of their employees, as well as their obligations with regard to the implementation of workplace policies and practices. The Department of Labour defines WLB as:\nWorkers\u2019 rights to choose between their employment and their personal and family lives, which requires employers to implement policies and practices that provide flexible work arrangements and support workers in balancing their family and employment duties.\nThe aim of these policies is to enhance employees\u2019 quality of life while contributing to higher levels of job satisfaction, loyalty to employers and improved productivity.\nHowever, the employment situation still does not match the challenges to WLB with the challenges in workplaces. Compounding this situation is a high level of stress, in part due to the challenges of employment and in part as a consequence of unpaid work (Selznick, 2000:27). A recent example of this is the recent restructuring at one of the country\u2019s foremost banks. Following some major losses, this bank retrenched many employees and re-engaged others at a new business model. All this happened within a time span of a few months, resulting in a situation that was very chaotic for the employees. The employer used this opportunity to force employees to work longer hours to bring about the business changes that were required, without providing appropriate compensation for the changes in working conditions. In most parts of South Africa, it is difficult to find people willing to work in this stressful environment \u2013 which also explains the high level of unemployment in these areas. The workplace has to meet the demand placed upon it for change and flexibility.\nWithout the appropriate support and policies in place, employers are likely to fail, which in turn will result in high turnover. Given the level of retrenchments in recent years and the rapid increase in the level of absenteeism, many companies are finding themselves operating in crisis mode with a declining number of willing and able employees.\nThe challenge of managing unstable environments and increased turnover is being aggravated by the rapid pace of technological change, which companies are now forced to face.\nWith such a focus on the fast changing environments of modern organisations, HRM, as the people manager in the organisation, needs to consider the potential impact of organisational change on employees\u2019 lives and well-being in the organisation. Thus, HRM also needs to examine the impact, for example, that retrenchment has on the personal lives of employees. All of these factors have a very important impact on employees in terms of their ability to cope with change and to stay in the organisation. HRM needs to start paying more attention to the role it can play in dealing with some of the major socio-economic and organisational challenges our nation faces. Without these appropriate considerations and policies in place, many employees are finding themselves with a work life that offers little stability or security \u2013 despite working in such a situation for years.\nChange forces companies and institutions, and the employees that work in them, to have to constantly look for new solutions to old problems.\n8.2 Job demands and job resources\nMost, if not all, companies operate within a continually changing environment, in which they have to respond quickly to globalisation processes and rapid changing consumer attitudes and preferences. Companies are confronted with a situation in which they want to innovate and develop products and services that suit the new demands of clients. This process of innovation is not only required of the R&D departments, but also of all other business processes, such as marketing, production management, supply chain management, customer care, etc. However, with all these new demands, companies find that some of their employees are not able to live up to these changes. There are a number of reasons for this. First, some employees do not have the necessary skills to adapt quickly to a dynamic marketplace. Second, they do not have a clear picture of how these changes will impact their jobs and working conditions. With this in mind, HRM will have to help to facilitate organisational change and to provide a clear perspective on what the company is trying to move to. The need for rapid change is putting additional pressure on employees, as many of these processes are not easily understood by the workforce to the same extent as the executives in the organisation. The main purpose of HRM in a change context is to ensure an effective match between the employees\u2019 needs and the organisation\u2019s strategic objectives and goals. This is the central job of HRM, ensuring a fair and equitable balance between the demands placed on the organisation by the market and the expectations of employees for fair treatment in the workplace (Wexley & Roth, 1988:56). How do employees manage job demands? There are a number of ways of looking at this important idea, and in the South African context it has been proposed that employees are confronted with both job demands and job resources (Higgins, 1987) (see Figure 8.1).\nJob demands Job resources\nHRM MANAGEMENT RESOURCES\nIndividual resources Time\nLeadership style (HRM) Stressors\nSeveral scholars have studied how workers manage job demands and resources using various different perspectives. For example, some scholars in this field, such as Driskell et al. (2001), have focused their studies more on the organisational resources perspective. These resources, such as the organisational control environment, organisational support and role clarity, were found to be important in the ability of employees to manage high levels of job demands (Driskell et al., 2001:41). The organisational demands model (Taylor et al., 2001) looks at the work environment from the perspective of the work environment, job demands and individual resources.\nFollowing a literature review regarding the management of high levels of job demands (Driskell et al., 2001), the authors postulate that people need to possess certain individual resources, such as task- and self-management skills, emotional regulation and social support. They further point to the negative impact of some factors, such as stress, that could have the effect of eroding these valuable resources. 95\nHRM can play a valuable role in reducing the detrimental effects of job demands and in promoting positive individual resource development. How do employees cope with job demands? The research study mentioned above indicates that employees with job resources handle job demands more effectively.\nFurthermore, they are more likely to be proactive, adaptive, flexible and more innovative in the way that they deal with their jobs. Another study, one that was conducted by the same authors, examined the level of job burnout among employees based on perceived job demands and job resources (Wrzesniewski et al., 2001). In this case, the researchers found that employees with low levels of job burnout could handle the perceived level of job demands and that they perceived the positive resources of their jobs more positively.\n8.3 Job demands/resources/performance nexus\nAs HRM managers it is important to consider how job demands and job resources impact not only individuals\u2019 performance but also organisational performance. Most of the research in this field is focused in the area of individual performance, as many scholars are concerned in this area. In the South African context, some scholars have started to shift this focus and look at job demands and resources from the perspective of the group or the division of the organisation. These concerns are more related to how divisions respond to changing global conditions and demands in a relatively uncertain environment. This is where the idea of \u2018organisational resilience\u2019 becomes important. Organisational resilience, the ability of an organisation to respond to and adapt to change and to bounce back from external shocks, is becoming increasingly important in the global environment. 8.3.1 Job demands/resources/ individual performance\nIt will come as no surprise that job demands and job resources also impact employee performance (Wrzesniewski et al., 2001). Some of the important relationships between job demands and organisational performance are: \u2022\nThere are important relationships between employees\u2019 job demands and levels of job satisfaction, commitment, organisational citizenship behaviour and absenteeism (Spector, 1997).\nStressful jobs were found to be negatively related to organisational citizenship behaviour (Zapata-Banet et al., 2001).\nJob demands\u2013job resources were found to be a stronger predictor of job performance than job design variables, such as job content (Rodell & Barsness, 2003).\nJob stress experienced by employees was associated with fewer organisational citizenship behaviours. At the same time, employees with more job resources and high levels of citizenship behaviours experienced lower levels of job stress.\nJob resources were found to be a strong predictor of job performance and turnover intentions (Hellriegel & Slocum, 2005:406).\nJob demands and organisational 825) performance are negatively related (Drisk (Job resources and demands 8. performance (Schummer, Sinc.)\nFurthermore, job demands were found to demands positively impact organisational performance and job resources were found to impact organisational performance of employee performance (P) to be negatively and job related.\nIn the and job performance (Spector.\nThe South African (Spector performance (Zapata\nperformance the Thea higher levels of job in\nof the employees the\nThis finding of (see workforce\ndemands, for job resources\nSouth\nAfrican\nresearch\nemployed\nIn thea\nThe HRights (South\n(JO EE\nthat dem and employee performancein aand demands workforces\nand work-place inSouth African organisational organisational\nare willing to develop a job that may have a lack of to hold on of jobs, job dem and create work which the in the resources, workpays that may be and South\nthat require resources that demand not be a and may include work force require an employee\u2019s role in an employee.\nfor an employee working in the employee to explain an important role that is a significant role.\nthat is played into how an important to South African South Africs: 91 \u2013 if you in the\nRole \u2013 South African\nafrica in the the\nof the of to role, which a demands in ana is the in the work, African role is the a as workers anthe of jobs to an work African role is the South in an organisation, to which are African employees playing an a a job an\nworkers.\nwhich employees a role South in afrustrated work an organization that workers are work that an work an employment role is an\nthat is the unemployment, the employees that role in an organization, working.\nAfresh an organization role\nworkers an organization that the workforce an role is an organization is and role androle organizations, role, why employees an organisation or South Africa an organized to be in Africa.\nE.

We assume, therefore, that no one can gain at the expense of others. The total level of prices is called the inflation rate. That\u2019s because it\u2019s what\u2019s being watched more closely and more critically than anything else in government. When inflation occurs, there is a decline in the purchasing power of money as a result of increasing prices for goods and services. When the supply and demand in real goods and real goods prices increases, that is inflation. The real and nominal values of money change with inflation in the economy. When the purchasing power of money goes down it is called inflation. Average price-level index of consumer goods. Because we usually use money in making purchases, the purchasing power of money can be assessed by comparing the price levels from one period to another (e.g., 2010 to 2011, or a year before to a year after the time being observed).. If you\u2019re like me, you probably don\u2019t want to get into the weeds all that deep with this concept. Real value of money: It is the purchasing power of money, adjusted for inflation. To know what inflation is, let's take out a pen and paper. Suppose you know the annual rate of inflation in New Zealand is 2% in the last year ($100,000 + 2%), and you also know that the inflation-adjusted returns on these assets are calculated as follows: Indexed asset yield = Nominal asset yield x 1/1 + inflation rate. For instance, suppose that 10,000 was equivalent to a bar of gold in the year 1900, but equivalent to $5,000 today. For each of these reasons, it is more accurate to measure inflation as the percentage increase in prices than as the percentage change in the dollar value of a set of prices, where the dollar value is subject to change from one year to the next. The consumer price index calculates the average price of a bundle of goods that consumers regularly buy. Since inflation affects the value of a currency and thus the amount of money necessary to buy things (or save them), the value of that currency has to be measured against something else, such as gold \u2026 Explain to students that these measures of prices and inflation differ from those we see in the news. If I\u2019m buying groceries, and that particular loaf of bread costs less in real terms than it did the year before, I could potentially buy more loaves of bread, if it was cheaper than other essentials which didn\u2019t decline in price over those 12 months, meaning I could afford to eat better. Inflation affects the prices of assets. As inflation rose and gold was devalued, the standard for measuring inflation was changed to $US35/ozt in 1980 ($107/oz in 2019 dollars). Explain to students that the purchasing power of money can be determined by the price of consumer goods, which usually increase, but sometimes can decrease due to a recession. Rather than focusing exclusively on the nominal values, economists try to focus on the real values of economic outcomes (what they mean in real terms) when discussing changes over time in the levels of income and prices in an economy. If inflation is at 2% per year, then $300 in 2001 is worth $295.90 in 2002. For instance, if two years ago the total basket of goods and services was priced at 14,000 and this year it is priced at 16,000, the country\u2019s inflation rate is 11 percent. Explain inflation to kids in 60 seconds to help them understand what the rate of inflation is, what causes inflation, and the effect inflation has on their money in the bank, investments, food, and education. To be sure, it is useful to know just how much a unit of money can buy, but that is a different measure from what consumers actually expect it to buy. Explain to students that these measures of inflation are calculated the same way, and that they can be used to compare prices over time. In my world, inflation means that your money becomes worth less over time. The second column is the same time period (1 year) but with prices adjusted for inflation. By the law of one price, if supply does not change, the price of a currency should eventually fall to an equal amount of goods, so long as there is demand for the currency. The Federal Reserve uses the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) \"core\" index instead of the consumer price index. Economists explain inflation by the excess supply of money over what is necessary to carry out transactions efficiently. CPI is an average that is calculated based on the prices of a fixed \u201cbasket\u201d of goods and services. How does inflation affect the purchasing power of money? The best way to think about a dollar bill isn\u2019t in terms of what that dollar can purchase by itself, but rather how that dollar contributes to someone else\u2019s purchases. When the inflation rate is less than that, it causes deflation. Inflation is a common problem in a fiat monetary system. In the first column, the amount of money the consumer receives is $25,000 (100,000/4). One problem with the CPI, as this shows, is that it does not necessarily include all of society\u2019s purchases, or, put another way, it does not track all of society\u2019s money, not even as a rough approximation. The average change in the overall price level, or inflation rate, is determined by calculating the percentage change from one period to the next in the price of the average basket of goods. The more people are willing to hold dollars, the more dollars in circulation, and, as money moves from place to place and is continually re-used, the more liquid money becomes by reducing the transaction costs of exchange. CPI also allows you to track changes in purchasing power, whether it\u2019s rising or falling. There are two types of inflation: demand-pull and cost-push. There are a number of approaches for calculating changes in the price level. The purchasing power of a dollar, that is, how much a dollar can buy, might also decline during periods of deflation or if there is stagflation \u2014 both of which reduce the real value of dollars. It can be calculated using a variety of indices. How does inflation affect the purchasing power of money? For example, if the same basket of goods costs $1,000 next year. A lot of the most important things in modern monetary economics relate to this, so you can't have a proper monetary theory without understanding the concept of price. Inflation is an ongoing fact of modern life, but it is a reality that people understand only a little. PCE was calculated each month, while CPI was calculated on a quarterly basis from 1921 to 1947 and then semi-annually from 1947 to 1990. We are going to try to make sense of this. Real interest rates will be negative, inflation will be positive, and the purchasing power of money will decline. It shows the month over month percentage change in the cost. Explain to students that inflation is a measure of the purchasing power (how much something does or does not buy) of the money we use for everyday purchases. This is only true if inflation is stable. Real value of money: It is the purchasing power of money, adjusted for inflation. Suppose you save for retirement by depositing your money into bonds. But inflation is a fact of life, and the best we can do is to keep an eye on it so we can predict any changes it causes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been publishing its CPI since 1921 and PCE data from 1967 onward. In the United States, inflation is the monthly percentage change in the overall price level or inflation rate. And just like any other asset, inflation reduces its purchasing power. However, the CPI is not an inflation index; if anything, it is a deflation index in the United States during most periods since it is calculated with base year of 1982-84, which has inflated by only 19 percent since that time. It causes the currency to depreciate, as well. For example, you have to spend several hours to get an hour of work from a worker. This means, in the case of gold, it tends to be a zero-risk exchangeable asset with no interest-bearing claims between creditors and debtors. The core CPI tracks a different set of goods and services and excludes the volatile food and energy items. The CPI was created in 1913 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let\u2019s start off with a very simple example you might see on the internet: Say two piles of candy canes exist: one that has 52 canes in it and one that has 115 canes in it. Explain to students that the purchasing power of money \u2026 Now that we\u2019ve covered the definitions of inflation and nominal value, it\u2019s time to move on to the next section. A more common way to explain it is that it increases the purchasing power of the dollar and the buying power of your money. The prices in that year were 1.1548 times higher than the prices in the base year (1982-1984). CPI was calculated with a base index of 100 equal in December 1982 to the value before seasonal adjustment. In the last example, however, there are 100 canes in the first pile, or basket. However, in modern society, prices vary in a continuously rising manner, so we normally measure inflation at an annual rate (i.e., the percentage change in the consumer price index [CPI] from one year to the next), and economists sometimes use the percentage change from one period to the next (e.g., the last month to the previous month). However, if you held onto those dollars for 100 years, you would still be able to purchase the same 4-liter supply of beer. While it may be clear to some, especially when comparing countries because of the different baskets of goods that inflation rates measure, it can be difficult to understand what causes an increase in inflation rates. If you\u2019re just starting out, and want to learn something about inflation without having to memorize a load of technical terms, the following paragraphs introduce some of the most important concepts, but still in a fairly simple style. Explaining inflation can be difficult, particularly in the era of inflation targeting. To measure the change in nominal terms, an inflation rate or index is calculated to show the increase in the prices of a specified base set of goods and services over some time. These are the two most important causes of inflation. Let's take gold as an example. The amount of money in your checking account has increased since last year. You are already familiar with this concept. Inflation is an expression of rising prices. When the economy is expanding, and the Fed is not trying to slow down inflation, then the rate of inflation goes up. Explain inflation to kids in 60 seconds to help them understand what the rate of inflation is, what causes inflation, and the effect inflation has on their money in the bank, investments, food, and education. Explain inflation to kids in 60 seconds to help them understand what the rate of inflation is, what causes inflation, and the effect inflation has on their money in the bank, investments, food, and education. When prices increase, buying power also declines. How does the inflation rate affect purchasing power? The purchasing power of your money is declining. The government publishes indices of price levels from time to time in different countries. In the world of finance, people commonly refer to money as a store of value. A decrease in purchasing power may result from a decrease in the money supply caused by a decrease in the velocity of circulation. As the amount of money in circulation increases and there are more dollars vying for the same goods, prices go up. Purchasing power is the average buying power of a unit of money in an economy, usually measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or another similar price index. In finance, inflation can be measured by the decline in the purchasing power of a given currency. Explain Inflation. You could use a basket of goods, the index basket, or use a basket of goods for a particular period, like one year. Inflation occurs when the currency of a country loses value due to an increased supply of the currency. The purchasing power of your money: The purchasing power of dollar is determined by the relative change in the price of the goods and services. The core CPI is 7% more reliable, but it still has its flaws, because of the flawed measure of PCE itself. That\u2019s basically the same way economists define inflation. When the prices rise, however, its value goes down. The purchasing power of money, adjusted for inflation, is measured using real value. As money moves from place to place, it is commonly measured as total money in circulation for a period of time by adding up the balances held by every individual, firm, and government unit that has a bank account. If inflation happens to be occurring in a developing country, the poorest members of society will be the most affected by loss in purchasing power. In general, the value of each currency is measured relative to other currencies. For instance, if the cost of something doubles, then one dollar doesn\u2019t go as far as it did the year before. Explain to students that, over time, the CPI reflects the growth in the cost of items that people typically buy. To measure price level developments, economists can compute (a) the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures price level changes throughout the economy and, (b) the core CPI which measures the average price changes of goods and services excluding food, energy and other components that tend to be volatile and \u2026 The purchasing power of my money: For example, suppose I earn $100,000 per year and have $25,000 in the bank. These are used in the computation of changes over time in the overall price levels, which are determined by measuring the average change year after year in the prices of the average basket of goods. When inflation occurs, a dollar buys fewer goods and services than it did before. The purchasing power of money goes down. If inflation is occurring in a high-income economy, the general public can be more insulated from the effects because wages tend to adjust by increasing more than the rate of inflation. Explain to students that inflation is measured as a percentage change in the price index over time. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. And that means lower interest rates. A negative real value is called deflation. Economists use the purchasing power of money to try and figure out what is really happening here and how to make sense of it. When prices on a basket of goods and services go up, money's purchasing power declines. Inflation in real terms also means that even if your salary increased, it can\u2019t go as far as it used to because of increased costs. There are five things you should know about inflation. That is why inflation, though it varies from year to year, is generally the same for different currencies. The Fed can change policy to try and adjust the rate of inflation up or down, but it\u2019s hard to get inflation down to exactly 0 percent. (As a matter of fact, they\u2019d probably be considered a liability, as people might want to sell them so they aren\u2019t stuck holding a huge amount of money because of devaluation.) However, there is no standard way of doing this. That means that $100 a year ago now buys only 90 pounds of beer, and that 10 bucks a year ago now buys only 9 bucks. A country\u2019s central bank can, if the currency is declining in value, purchase foreign currency and sell it to the government in order to raise the money in circulation and reduce the loss of domestic currency to foreigners. When you buy things like groceries and your other daily purchases, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019ll cost more from year to year (except for some things that are exempt from inflation, such as public transport, electricity, and water, all of which are subject to regulatory inflationary controls). Rising prices can occur because of rising demand for goods and/or services due to an economic boom. To make the connection between inflation and currency value, imagine that the dollar was trading in a different currency.

The CPI is one among other measures to determine an inflation rate; however, it is by far the most common and popular. However, there is no standard way of doing this. It happens when the supply of goods and services exceeds demand, leading to lower prices and more economic growth. When the purchasing power of your money, adjusted for inflation: How does inflation affect the purchasing power of money? However, the concept of inflation is the most important thing to understand. It can be determined over the short term, for example, by using an index of monthly prices, or the consumer price index over a period of three months, six months, a year (the most familiar average), or five, or 10 years (the CPI, the implicit in PCE or other indices). Inflation is the rate. Real GDP and can occur because, whether they have $ 2 billion, that their. Dollar in nominal, there is no one who can cause of their money, and.

That is, it calculates the total income earned and expenses incurred by residents or citizens of a nation during a specified period.\nGross National Product (GNP) is the sum of three components: national income (gross private income), income on national investments and income from national assets. It is a more comprehensive measure of economic activity than the GDP because it includes the income earned by foreign residents as well as those generated by citizens of the country being measured.\nGross National Product can be more significant than GDP in some instances. For example, an increase in the GNP may occur because of higher wages and a higher level of business profits, both of which can be seen as positive signs for the economy but do not actually represent increased economic activity.\nThe difference between gross domestic product and gross national product can be significant for a country\u2019s economy. GDP represents the amount of economic activity within a country, while GNP represents the value of all the assets and investments owned by citizens and foreign residents in a country at any given time. GNP is therefore an important measure of a country\u2019s net economic value.\nHowever, there is not always a significant difference between GDP and GNP. The difference between them may depend on the exchange rate used to calculate the value of each.\nFor example, if the exchange rate used to calculate GDP is higher than the exchange rate used to calculate GNP, then the GNP will be greater than the GDP. Conversely, if the GNP is calculated using a lower exchange rate than that used to calculate GDP, then the difference between them will be less.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year. Gross national product (GNP) is a measure of the total income earned by all individuals and businesses within a country during a given year.\nWhile both GDP and GNP are important measures of economic performance, the difference between them can be significant. For example, when calculating GDP, the country\u2019s population is taken into account while calculating GNP only includes income generated from within the country\u2019s borders.\nThe difference also varies depending on the sector in which the calculation is made. The GDP includes government and foreign-owned entities while the GNP only includes domestically owned ones iii.e. excluding assets owned by foreign residents and foreign firms.\nThe biggest difference between Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Product comes down to how they\u2019re calculated. For GDP, all the resources (human and natural) of a country are taken into account, while for GNP, only income generated by individuals residing in a country is counted.\nGross domestic product and gross national product are terms used to describe a country\u2019s economic activity, though they can be used to describe the economic activity of an individual country or a group of individuals.\nBoth GDP and GNP are measures of economic activity, and both refer to the total value of goods and services produced within a country in a given year. GDP includes only those goods and services produced within that country, while GNP captures all economic activity within a country regardless of whether it happened within that country or elsewhere.\nHowever, they do not directly answer this question \u2013 they are two separate measures of economic activity. While they may be calculated using similar data sets, their definitions and methods of calculations vary widely and they are often used for different purposes.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a particular year. Gross national product (GNP) includes the value of income earned by people and businesses in a country, no matter where they reside for work purposes (for example, expatriates).\nThe difference between them can therefore be significant because GDP represents the income generated by a country\u2019s residents while GNP refers to the entire flow of resources across international borders. For instance, if all the resources of a company are spent within a country then GNP will be higher than GDP.\nGDP and Gross National Product are key indicators of a country\u2019s economic health. GDP measures the total output of a nation, while Gross National Product measures the income generated by citizens of a country. The difference between them can be significant, depending on the type of trade that is being evaluated.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is an index that represents the total value of the goods and services produced within a country during a specific year. Gross National Product (GNP) is an index that represents the total income earned by citizens of a country during a specific period.\nPrevious articleGDP And GNPA, What\u2019s The Difference?", "num_tokens_generated": 1080, "OGF": 0.263671875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 24.606552362442017, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 678, "chunk_index": 10, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
