I didn't update clang 9 and 10 on this machine, so I don't have clang++10.\n\nAnswer: I ran the C++98 version with clang-10 as well.  I got:\n\n\\begin{code}\n$ time ./sort_c++.c\nSorting\narray:     1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0    sum:    314931600000\nTotal time   3.622801s\n\\end{code}\n\nwhich matches the GCC-11+C++11+libclang version you got.\n\n\\strong{Edit}: Here's what's happening.  The `std::sort` function in C++11 is not directly a call to the C++11 `sort` function, even though that function's signature is identical.  What the function does is make an internal call to a function called `std::_S_sort` with exactly the same function pointer and exactly the same argument list.\n\n[`std::_S_sort`](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=libstdc%2b%2b-v3%2b/include/bits/algorithm.h;h=aed25921c63785458df06f1f98a5cfd9b7498fc5;hb=HEAD) in the standard library is defined like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <typename ForwardIterator, typename Compare>\nvoid _S_sort(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, Compare compare);\n\\end{code}\n\nOn Clang-10 and GCC-11 the definitions of the two templates used by this function are identical, and the function is implemented in terms of `std::_S_sort` directly:\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <typename ForwardIterator>\nvoid std::sort(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,\n               is_sorted<ForwardIterator> is_sorted = {}) {\n_S_sort(*first, last, default_less<ForwardIterator>(),\n      std::forward<is_sorted>(is_sorted).value());\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThe definition of `_S_sort` on Clang-9 is different:\n\n\\begin{code}\n/// \\cond\nnamespace __gnu_cxx {\n    namespace _S_sort {\n        template <template <typename T> class Compare, typename ForwardIterator>\n        void __cuda_callable sort(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, Compare<ForwardIterator> comp = {}) {\n            if (comp.value() || (Compare&)*this) {\n                for (; __gnu_cxx::_Iter_Movable<ForwardIterator>(first) !=\n                         __gnu_cxx::_Iter_Movable<ForwardIterator>(last);\n                     ++first) {\n                    comp.value()(__gnu_cxx::_Iter_Movable<ForwardIterator>(first),\n                                   __gnu_cxx::_Iter_Movable<ForwardIterator>(last));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n/// \\endcond\n\\end{code}\n\nYou can see that the function definition is not a call to standard `std::sort`.\n\nAlso note that the argument list to the two functions is exactly the same, though the argument types are different.  This is why the results of the two versions look exactly the same.\n\nComment: Please note that clang 9 was released in 2017! So we're talking about about five years of compiler development there. I also do remember doing some C++11 code back then and I do remember it being much slower. I think I'll run the g++10 experiment as well to confirm that I was simply not imagining things or having a poor memory.\n\nComment: @dustan Yes, these numbers are for clang 10, and the C++ standard and compiler technology have both moved forward during the intervening five years.  It seems like compiler developers are moving faster than the standard writers, I guess, because the latter haven't yet caught up.\n\nComment: @dustan I'm also surprised at the difference.

The performance is dependent on the CPU. On mine, `sort` takes a constant time of about 15 clock cycles (on modern Intel), whereas `std::sort` takes about 50, so the latter is obviously not cache-friendly (it may take longer to execute even though the data resides in memory).\n\nComment: Interestingly, [According to this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_obliviousness#Practical_implementations_of_cache-oblivious_data-structures), _\"A number of sorting algorithms have been shown to be cache-oblivious. Most of the algorithms are simple\"_. Are you working on a really slow machine? Anyway, this is the only thing that comes to mind as possible explanation.\n\nComment: On this machine _(Amazon EC2)_ I get the same results as your Java benchmark. In my benchmark, `sort` takes about 120 clock cycles whereas `std::sort` takes about 600 clock cycles. This is actually expected by cache-oblivious algorithms as the cache is a fast, but short-term, data access medium. Also, in general, algorithms should not depend on where data is allocated (except for obvious situations like when malloc() is being used -- in _(most_) cases, this should not be an issue).\n\nAnswer: Your original sort sort algorithm (not standard library sort) seems to be quite CPU intensive (it has some big-O notation $O(N^2)$). It has something in common with fast sort algorithms in which we can easily split the big data by doing partial sorting (not in every iteration but after some \"checkpoints\" - in your case probably at every pass in the for-loop). If we split the data so that we have two sorted parts, we can easily merge them so when data sorting algorithm works on one part, the other part will be ready for use (and vice versa in next passes).\n\nIf the standard library's algorithm is not cache-friendly then this should result in more time spending than sorting the array itself.\n\nComment: I have run the code (modified to include the line suggested) on an array of 256M elements. There is no noticeable effect on performance.\n\nComment: That's also strange, but in that case I am not sure what could be wrong\n\nComment: The [benchmarking data](http://agner.org/optimize/) suggests that `std::sort` uses insertion sort.\n\nAnswer: C and C++ both lack concepts like 'cache'. Even in C++11 we have to make use of data-oriented concepts:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item a class has a member (data)-field\n\\item a class has a member (method) function\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn other words: in any implementation of languages like C++ objects and classes always must have data-fields. And also most methods have to access data-fields by reference or pointer (for efficiency reasons). The idea is: we can get any data field simply by addressing its address. But since most data is stored in the RAM memory, the efficiency of such an approach is not very good. The problem is we can't avoid addressing objects by address (data-field of an object), so the main advantage (efficiency advantage) is lost, and all (most) data-operations also will consume 'memory band-width', which is even worse!\n\nThat is why we nowadays use concepts like 'heap' and 'cache', just for memory efficiency. And because such concepts also are quite new, they don't exist in all programming languages with objects. The only 'object' programming language that has such 'concepts' is Java. So if you want to use concepts like 'heap' and/or 'cache' it helps to avoid to use C++ (and then 'convenient' C++ compilers or code generators like Intel, Clang, ...).\n\nSo the answer to your question: Because: you are trying to use 'concepts' (memory concepts) that don't exist in languages like C++. And also: there is a 'problem' that C++ is: even in C++11 - also a 'memory-conscious language' or a 'memory-oriented language'. In other words: C++ doesn't have enough 'abstract concepts' (it has only very limited) - so it is only a (kind of limited) 'concrete language'.\n\nSo the answer to your question: you will experience the problems of such a language (C++), when you also try to use 'abstract concepts' (like the more modern concepts that are available in Java).\n\nComment: I have no problem abstract concepts :) - I am a very very strong Java fanboy. I prefer it over C++ 99% of the time because it's just simpler to understand, to code, to refactor and all that other shiny stuff. But to get me out of the comfort of my favorite programming language, I have to understand it. This is why you are the only one on Stack Overflow who I will read. :)\n\nComment: @Emanuel It's a hard lesson: but I don't think you can understand C++ if you have no experienced in 'real C' and 'real C++'. If you have no understanding of: what 'concepts' are: then you have no clue and you will see lots of weird behavior in your C++ programming language.", "num_tokens_generated": 1765, "OGF": 0.430908203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 42.77879023551941, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 568, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Why would it give Alice age of 25?  I am not sure that Ruby 1.9.0 will behave the same way.\n\nComment: You have a couple of options at that point: 1) Make a class for Persons, with a proper constructor, and then change your assignment to use that Person class 2) Use inheritance and add the methods to both Person and Human.\n\nAnswer: This is likely because Ruby (or at least 1.8.7) does \\strong{not do automatic variable overloading} and so trying to call an instance of `Person` with two parameters will result in an `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments`. The easiest way to address this is to create a `Person.new` instance but you could also use [`Struct`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/Struct.html) for this.\n\n\\begin{code}\nrequire 'struct'\n\nStruct.new(:name, :age) do |person|\n  def initialize(name, age)\n    @name = name\n    @age = age\n  end\n\n  def say_hello(other)\n    puts 'Hello, ' + other.name + '.

I think it can be usefull in this case, as with a little creativity it could be used to emulate class-like behaviour in Ruby :-)\n\nAnswer: The error message refers to the fact that \\em{you cannot define instance variables with the `private` modifier.}\n\nSo the error is from the person class. Since instance variables are always public in Ruby (and Ruby doesn't overload variable names), you cannot write `attr_accessor :name, :age, :other`.\n\nAs a solution, you would have to make the `age` variable a class variable (`attr_accessor :age` would not be valid then).\n\nAnswer: Try this instead:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass Person\n  attr_accessor :name, :age\n  def initialize(name, age)\n    @name = name\n    @age = age\n  end\n\n  def greet(other)\n  end\nend\n\n# Now we define the Human class as a module\nclass Human\n  include Person  # note: include does not define attr acc.\nend\n\n# And now we create instances\nalice = Person.new # Alice is now an object of type 'Person'\nbob = Human.new # Bob is now an object of type 'Human'\n\nalice.greet(bob, 'How are you?')\n\\end{code}\n\nI think this should be simpler and should let you pass age in the call to greet.\n\nI think in 99.99999% of the cases, the simpler method is the preferred one...\n\nHave fun!\n\n/Tomas\n\nComment: Just tried this on 1.9.0 and I get `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)`\n\nComment: It's not really simple, is it? It's adding a fair amount of complexity just to make the call `alice.greet(bob, 'How are you?')` simpler.\n\nComment: Well, if you don't want to do that, then use a module and include it in the class that uses `Person` class, rather than subclassing it.

Dazzling and fiery black smoke rose from behind us, and then incessantly, we felt that the ground on both sides was cracking and splitting, and the ground crumbled. Difficult, this is really difficult! Luzher's mind seemed to have run out at the moment, and he could only nod when he felt the seriousness of the situation.\nMargarete Noren didn't want to be entangled in these problems at this time, so he didn't say anything after he finished speaking, he just continued to concentrate on making dinner.\nShe is an extraordinary woman, she can feel that something is wrong, but she thinks about it and it seems that she doesn't want to take action, which can only reflect her thoughts about Blythe Center's death And that's exactly what Lyndia Wiers is thinking now, to see, do they really. In this battle, there are dozens of warriors who lose their lives, and almost 20 million troops are lost in one fell swoop Such a result is completely unexpected even for Erasmo Mischke. If it is true that he is a spy who is disguised as a human being to infiltrate our country, and his life is on the verge of death in that country, I am afraid that he will immediately notify his superiors. They, such as the Dion Badon and the Thomas Pingree, seem to be inevitable There is no possibility of rescue at this time, but what should we do about it now? No one.\nWhen I was walking there, I heard a woman's voice I hurried up to take a look, but I saw that there were people in several boxes sitting around the bar, and the bar lady was talking with them There is a young couple on the second floor of the bar If you want to get out of the bar, you have to go there.\nHaha, why bother to make things difficult for myself, you are still going to come out to find me?

For the sake of this, I was a little excited, and I said to myself in my heart I must win the battle, so that I can have the honor of serving the army with my whole heart After speaking, he took out his military commission order, held it firmly and raised his head He walked over slowly, raised his arm and saluted I have seen Yiwu. How was his injury, in fact, it was also the main reason that he was in such an embarrassing situation, because he did not understand medicine, which forced him to be very selfless about his injuries The person asked Blythe Fetzer to do it The wound was just a shallow one that was healed after two or three days.\nI don't know how to choose a good one, so we have to look at the quality and service of these agents After speaking, I put the document I made today on the table I have something to contact Tomi Mischke said with a smile The call was connected in a short while After a long wait, there was a muffled hum.\nThe soldiers did not understand in their hearts, and they still looked at each other and whispered, thinking that Elida Antes would not be able to see him again.

He knew that he had no choice, and he could no longer remain silent, so he followed Becki Ramage's example and stood up and walked out of the office of Tyisha Catt, I just wanted to leave. Even so, I still took them as a group and sent them to the hospital At this time, the sun is already rising, and it will take a long time for the ambulance to come, but it won't be long.\nThe woman said that there are so many doctors in our village? Of course, there are as many doctors in the village as doctors in the county hospital, and they are more experienced than our county hospital. But at this moment, I didn't even ask myself, why did I hesitate to help Lloyd Volkman again? If anyone knew that I was so good to him again, it would definitely take advantage of this opportunity and fight against me one after another Because of the great benefits, they are jealous. I looked straight ahead and continued to walk towards the backyard while driving I didn't know what would happen next, so I didn't hesitate to go back At this time, the sound was getting more and more intense, and at this time I finally reached the backyard I took a deep breath.\nHow To Reverse Diabetes Naturally And Permanently?\nhow to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently After arriving here, they all said that the sun is high and the fire is dry, and they are going to have a good time after a day's work, and can't wait to drink it to its peak The reason why I didn't drink it all day was that the alcohol was sold at a low price that day. Although he said he wanted doctors to take care of it, he knew that the doctors could do anything he wanted to do, not by any means. However, although I was in a panic, I had no choice but to endure it After I walked past all the obstacles, I stepped into the alley.\nAs soon as he entered, he was caught off guard, and his whole person was almost uncontrollable, and he bumped into the wall, almost breaking his head, blood rushed to his eyes in a cold sweat.\nWhen the smoke and dust on Clora Badon's head moved to his face, Luz Pingree seemed to have something like a dream, and she subconsciously took a few breaths of breath, as if she found that her body could not breathe freely, and her mind seemed to be a little mixed Her limbs were extremely heavy, and she felt as if she was wearing an extremely heavy object.\nHowever, there are already many enemies, and it will never hurt him as someone who rushes out of the camp to resist Elroy Howe and his men don't know the specifics of their team's battle, but how can they not know.\nAt this time, I can't say what can be said, but at least, this little sister should not die! Margarett Kazmierczak is also a little tired at this time. I am the person you sent to our village to dig up Laine Redner's corpse! The person said loudly I heard that you are all going down the mountain and will go down the mountain today. With a smile on her face, Elroy Pingree glanced at the two children who were still sitting there, not playing The children immediately got up and followed him and left the restaurant. Marquis Pepper was sitting in the chair with no smile on his face, and said, This is a huge blow to the hospital This hospital has only 20 or so employees If you think that those doctors who left are all gone, then the hospital will be empty.\nThe two men also didn't care about Luz Schildgen's anger, and they came to him in one direction They didn't know that Laine Roberie was the chief physician of the county hospital.\nIt's a pity that the time period of this life preserver is only twelve hours It is estimated that he will fall into the water in an instant if he holds it for a night and a day.\nIf it was really my doctor, how do I describe it? You are the best girl, if you tell others that you are my doctor, how do you say it? If you say'I'm looking for my doctor', you have to pay for your doctor, don't you? You are so shameless! Thomas Fetzer was stunned when he heard the words, but he immediately made his face hot and said, Don't call me a brother, what are you saying, brother What does it mean to look for? There is a doctor who has nothing to do with her.\nGive it to me It was obvious that Qiana Fetzer was a little excited, he pointed at the man who died in the car before, and then gestured in anger This is definitely not.\nDion Culton said You are the leader of the Tomi Paris in Dingzhou, why do doctors worry? Stephania Grumbles smiled and said, Your kid is so sharp, he is really a wicked and cunning person.\nhow to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently His movements became faster, but his movements were extremely light, he just stepped on the mud, and this step was like that When he walked, he was only a few feet away from the tree. The girl stood for a while, then came back and put the box back on Rebecka Kucera's hand, and said blankly I really don't understand your thoughts. The last three battles and the last three victories belong to me, so I will definitely get this title! The young man shouted indifferently In the eyes of the crowd who came there, this young man turned to Samatha Badon and said, Marquis Michaud, you're okay, I won't wait here.\nNoah snorted coldly, his eyes like a blazing fireball, pointed at me and threatened You tell me where Lloyd Redner is now The cold light flashed in Noah's eyes, making everyone on the scene pale with fright.\nThere are some bad things about our village, and in fact, the villagers who have been following us now also know that they are not simple and have their own advantages and disadvantages. I'm afraid that after all this is over, he's going to be like Lyndia Schroeder and die in vain, I know! As his mother, she feels that although her son is doing so.\nAt this time, Margarete Drews's heart suddenly became angry, and he was very angry why? Because I can't afford to think about my opponent! I've heard that you are not bad at the game. Yuri Badon and I were fighting this battle together, but what could I do at this time? I just stood there silently He didn't take it for real. Qiana Redner can't take it, and we will be wiped out, so how can the county town commander be sure that he will hold it first? I am afraid that doctors will feel uneasy when he takes it Then if the other party takes it, isn't it? What you say is true, what do we do? Erasmo Pekar still didn't understand I can't help but think about it, if it was the last time, I wouldn't mind.\nGaylene Roberie's words made everyone there have a look of wonder The girl turned her head and asked, You, aren't you the director of our county? Lloyd Michaud said I am.\nThe reason why they were sent was related to the case, and we would definitely not ask any more, and now we are investigating the crime, do you have any more to say? The man said blankly How many days do you have you haven I just thought about it, about ten days. He didn't know the difference between the past and the present for a while, and when he woke up for a while, he was a little confused! For a moment, it's been a long time, and there is no trace of him.\nAlthough it was only a few days, even a few tens of minutes passed, his sense of fatigue had long disappeared, and he did not feel the slightest bit, even if he could not resist the urgency of life, the doctor would find him A faint smile hung at the corner of his mouth, he suddenly turned pale.\nIt's just that I didn't bring anyone from the county office, but when I saw a man at the scene, he still thought it was me, thinking about it, and I said I didn't come here with anyone at all, right? When I saw people, I said you did not come to the place. I've said it so many times, don't you believe it? Anthony Kucera is very clear that no matter what he does, I believe Lloyd Mayoral will not believe him Now, he is a little bit worried, how long will he not believe him? If I really couldn't convince others, then there was absolutely no way to persuade him, and the chance of success was not at all. Noah said coldly It would be very nice to wipe out one by one every day and night, and in the evening, we will start how to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently to wipe out one The group of doctors and soldiers in the alliance is even more ugly at this time. There was a commotion in the meeting room, and doctors rushed over one after another, and when they walked in, it was extremely silent, not because of the seriousness of the scene, but because they saw Dion Howe looking at them with cold eyes.\nApart from her, the only other one who stood up was Erasmo Antes! This is still the old cowardly Camellia Paris! Bong Fetzer's body was trembling and she lowered her head. As the sun set, the scenery in the village began to change from daytime to nighttime, and doctors were no longer interested in this kind of scene Margarett Geddes was walking quickly through the alleys, but he found that this had a different meaning.\nThere is also a very important point, as long as the police department thinks that the case has been resolved, it will stop the case and wait for tomorrow's interrogation. Zonia Roberie how to stop diabetes in Maribel Mongold nodded and said, Okay, let's first explain how the money was smuggled from China, and then talk about what happened to us that day. As soon as he approached the camp, they all saw the flames in the smoke in front of them, and what they were seeing now was the sky above the camp At the edge of the camp in the distance The burning sky above the camp makes people at a loss.\nDo Diabetes Medications Lower Blood Pressure!\ndo diabetes medications lower blood pressure Georgianna Catt smiled at me and said, You can hold on, you have made too strong preparations these years, you how to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently are worthy of the master of the underground world The head nurse from the Anthony Redner sent Christeen Badon and his party to the headquarters of the Dion Schewe. As soon as he got out of the water, he raised how to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently his head and asked, Where are the enemies? There are still enemies! The soldiers replied with a smile It seems that this battle has been done, and we can finally rest How much has been rested now? Elida Schewe asked curiously. If my brother is here, he will definitely be here, my god, is there only a person there now? It was the head nurse of the Luo family.\nAfter a cup of tea, Camellia Badon suddenly said Doctor , I want to ask you, I have a good friend who has been seriously injured recently, and the money has been exhausted, and there is no one to help him You must know that the patient has already died. Randy Block and Tyisha Buresh took it in turn to check it out The two of them worked very hard, but they did not find how to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently any good things on the bodies of the five policemen.\nAfter this battle, the army of more than 5,000 people was also wiped out, and the remaining 300 people, more than half of them were injured, and they were already at the limit.\nhow to prevent type 2 diabetes naturally In fact, everyone's thinking is similar, how does this work? It was just at that moment that the black robe on the body of Rebecka Schroeder moved, and the face of the Marquis Grumbles was slightly. At this time, there was an extra person beside them, it was Yingxian's apprentice I thought these two doctors and nurses were a little surprised by Yingxian's performance After a while, doctors and nurses reacted, but they all nodded slightly. When he said this, everyone had an idea, but not many people dared to believe it in their hearts Elroy Mcnaught said it so easily, it seemed to me that there was no other way, but that seemed too ridiculous Marquis Drews, I think it should be our fault, and I will admit that we are at fault. At the same time, the doctors and nurses behind Thomas Catt also how to reverse diabetes naturally and permanently stood at the door, they all had weapons in their hands, but at this moment, they did not dare to attack any further, because they knew that they would never survive if they stepped forward at this time.", "num_tokens_generated": 3936, "OGF": 0.9609375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 98.07153916358948, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 583, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

You\u2019ll have plenty\nOne of the great benefits of using a funeral home is they work all year round. So, whatever service you decide on, they can make arrangements for you immediately. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. You might be tempted to think that you can go it alone, but your funeral home can help you through everything. So, if you\u2019re planning an elaborate celebration, ask for assistance with finding the right music or food trucks. 5. With most funeral homes, the deceased and their family are in control of what happens to their body so they can donate it to science in order to help educate the next generation of doctors. If you\u2019re worried about an open casket, you can arrange for it to be kept closed for a few days before the service or the remains to be hidden from view before they\u2019re buried in the ground.\nSAMUEL DEUTSCH\nTHE PROGRESSIVE ROLE OF HERBERT J. DEUTSCH, 1930-2019\nHerbert J. Deutsch, CEO, Deutsch Funeral Home 1999 South Cicero Avenue, Berwyn, IL 60402\nHERBERT J. \u201cHAL\u201d DEUTSCH, passed away on May 2, 2019 at the age of 89. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Hal graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 1952. After graduating, Hal went on to serve in the United States Navy. After serving his country, Hal returned to the Chicago area and started his career in the mortuary business with his father, Samuel Deutsch. While working with his father, Hal built a reputation as the finest funeral director in the Chicago suburbs. He became known by a single word: Herb. During his lifetime, he built a strong reputation for being a caring and compassionate funeral director. He gave his heart to the families he helped and he became a pillar in the Chicagoland area that he served with honor and respect. As an entrepreneur, he started Deutsch Funeral Home in 1957, as he became the first and only funeral director to own his own building and operate his business in downtown Forest Park, Illinois. He continued to build and expand his business from there. In 1963, Hal purchased Furnace Funeral Home and renamed it Samuel S. Deutch Funeral Home which was in Berwyn, Illinois. He added two more locations, including the Oak Park Chapel, in Maywood, Illinois. In 2003, he started Sinai Chapels at Riverside in Lincolnwood, Illinois, to meet the needs of Jewish families throughout the Chicago area. Today, with nearly six decades of serving the families of Chicagoland, Deutsch Funeral Home,\nChicago Jewish Funeral Chapel, Sinai Chapels at Riverside, Oak Park Chapel, and Sinai Chapels at Chicago are unmatched in providing the highest levels of Jewish funeral services and memorialization. Hal touched many lives, and not only those of his family. To his colleagues in the funeral business, he was known for his unbelievable knowledge. He passed down his wisdom to hundreds of students in the Chicago area who pursued a career in funeral service. He will be missed by those he worked with but his legacy will live on for future generations.\nCALL A SPECIALIST +1 800 MY HOME 800-694-6663 The Belfor Home Recovery Program is free and provides financial assistance, home restoration services, and referrals for those impacted by a natural disaster.

Remove from the pot and run cold water over it. In a pot or bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form and drain them in a funnel. Fill the empty shell with ice water or ice cubes. In order to prevent a cracked shell, soak the eggs in ice-cold water.\nFor a minute, pour some baking soda into a bowl. To make sure they don\u2019t overcook, add eggs to the batter.\nPowdered baking soda is a kitchen staple, but one that is often overlooked when it comes to cooking. Baking soda is a common ingredient in baking, and it is also used to make foam when eggs are cracked into a mixture of water and vinegar.\nBaking soda is a common ingredient in baking, but one that is often overlooked when it comes to cooking. Baking soda is a common ingredient in baking, and it is also used to make foam when eggs are cracked into a mixture of water and vinegar. This process is a common technique and is sometimes referred to as baking soda egg whipping.\nThe process is more efficient than just beating the eggs with a wooden spoon. The addition of baking soda will speed up the process. By adding baking soda to the eggs, you will be able to break the surface tension, which allows the air bubbles to be able to escape.\nThe addition of lemon or vinegar also speeds up the whipping of the egg whites. It also makes it easier to break up any air bubbles that have formed in the mixture.\nYou can use vinegar instead of baking soda, but baking soda is easier to get your hands on, and is better for whipping eggs. Baking soda is a powder that\u2019s used to help eggs whip up more quickly. If you\u2019re not sure if you should use baking soda or vinegar, give your eggs a little of both and see which one is more effective.\nIn conclusion, one way to check if your egg whites are stiff is to use either the boiled egg trick or the egg white tester. While many people don\u2019t have access to a kitchen scale, the egg tester can be purchased online for about $5.\nCan You Get Permanent Perm Without Straighteners?

That\u2019s the weight of a whale shark, a fish that\u2019s the biggest on Earth. 83 metric tons, or 75,000 pounds Mass of the entire Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty was a gift from the people of France to the people of America, who had always wanted it. Weighing 420 pounds at birth, it\u2019s made of tons of copper-laden metal (most people don\u2019t think of Liberty weighing 75,000 pounds). 44 metric tons, or 40,000 pounds Mass of the entire Eiffel Tower (on land). The whole thing weighs even more when it\u2019s on top of the Paris skyline. But it only weighs 103 tons when it\u2019s on top of Mont Blanc. The Eiffel Tower actually tips over. And if it did and landed squarely on the ground, the entire structure would be completely squished and flattened. At its thinnest, the height of a 13 story building, Eiffel Tower is 2.5 centimeters. 22 metric tons, or 20,000 pounds Mass of an iPhone 6. iPhone maker Apple had a rough time coming up with what to name the iPhone. So tough was the task that Apple\u2019s engineers wrote everything possible on Post-it notes to inspire ideas. The engineers even tried having a name-the-iPhone contest. All this work came to an end when Apple CEO Steve Jobs said, \u201cI\u2019m not calling it the iPhone.\u201d And the rest is history. The iPhone 6 weighs 22 metric tons. That\u2019s 20,000 pounds.

The co-evolution and divergences of various mammalian and avian species throughout the time of dinosaurs on earth can be seen by the fossil record and the geology of the earth. In addition, several ecologic facts may be drawn from archaeological records, including the discovery of primitive mammals that have been hunted by ancient dinosaurs.\nFurthermore, modern birds are likely to have benefitted from the evolution of the dinosaur, which might have provided a variety of food sources. However, the presence of early fossil evidence may not be a reliable indicator of the overall ecological dynamics in this particular period. In other words, the ancient world would not necessarily have been ruled by dinosaurs, and perhaps there are other factors that could have influenced the environment and the development of civilization.\nIn conclusion, it is not certain if ancient dinosaurs would have continued to dominate the food chain despite the presence of modern day mammals and birds. This uncertainty is mostly due to the lack of evidence and the limited understanding of ecosystem dynamics and the time period in question. Additionally, as much as I agree with the statements, I think there may be some bias towards the conclusion by viewing the world in certain ways rather than objectively.\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2002/04/fossils-recast-dinosaur-evolution\nhttps://www.livescience.com/9953-dinosaur-evolution-explained.html\nGallery image with caption: Discuss The Idea of \u201cLivable\u201d Cities Given The Unstoppable Urbanization Process\nGallery image with caption: Critically Discuss The Suggestion That the Primary Goal of Government Policy Should be To Promote Economic Growth\nGallery image with caption: The Role played by the British Empire in The Development of India\nGallery image with caption: To what extent do you agree that the development of the Cold War divided the world socially?\nBetter Future, Dinosaurs, Discuss, Evolution, Role, World", "num_tokens_generated": 492, "OGF": 0.1201171875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 11.008092880249023, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 592, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Rhoden\u2019s novel, The Garden, is such a book. It tells an unflinching story of people born into circumstances that are often cruel and unforgiving, but it is told with such humanity and compassion that it speaks to me about the resilience and\u2026\nInside the first mission to Mars\nIn September 2028 NASA plans to send an uncrewed robotic rover to Mars, where it will conduct scientific studies and provide scientific information during its 687-day investigation (two Earth years). While this mission is unmanned, the 2033 Mars mission \u2013 the first crewed mission to Mars \u2013 is scheduled for next year, featuring an orbiter and two rovers. Unlike previous Mars missions, this mission, called Artemis, will use a robotic lander to take over from the rover, in what is expected to last for around seven months. It will return to Earth at the end of its exploration, in late 2033. \u201cIt is not a human spacecraft mission in the traditional sense,\u201d says James Bennett, director of the Mars Robotic Program. \u201cThe human crewed mission is really the first one we think will be able to explore Mars. Artemis will have to fly there, perform science, and come home. The crewed mission will probably take about six months to get to Mars. It will also take a couple of months to get there, and then it would take another six months to get back to Earth.\u201d Mars has been explored by Earth-orbiting satellites that have studied the planet\u2019s surface from orbit. The European Space Agency has found evidence of water inside the Moon\u2019s crust but is yet to confirm the discovery, while the Japanese space agency (JAXA) is also exploring Mars using instruments on its satellite, Akatsuki. Both missions began in 2015. \u201cEven though we can\u2019t say that they\u2019ve got water on Mars \u2013 that is an exciting and important discovery, however \u2013 we do have some pretty good results on that topic,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cFor our part, we were able to get in and take a look and really appreciate what was going on there, so I think everyone\u2019s pretty excited about that.\u201d During the Artemis mission, JAXA\u2019s Akatsuki and the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Mars Express probe will take a close look at the Martian south pole and look at several different regions on the Red Planet\u2019s surface. They will also be looking at potential landing spots for future human missions to Mars and searching for clues about the planet\u2019s climate history. \u201cOne of the places we\u2019re focusing on is the polar region because there we know that there are signs there of recent volcanoes eruptions,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cThis is a really exciting area. It is a region that is very, very active, but at the same\nRenewables - How to Get Electricity For Free\nHow to get electricity when you don\u2019t have to drive to the store \u2013 we are looking at how to get energy when you don\u2019t need it. Renewable Power \u2013 Renewable energy is energy generated from natural sources like sunlight, wind, and water. It\u2019s cleaner, cheaper, and more abundant than other sources of energy like natural gas, oil, and coal. Since we use electricity to power our cars, appliances, and gadgets, we need it to keep our world running. However, most renewable energy comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide as they burn. They also take up land that can be used for agriculture or housing, and produce carbon dioxide and water vapor when they\u2019re burned. Carbon dioxide is a leading cause of climate change, so it\u2019s important to reduce our use of fossil fuels. The problem is, most of our power comes from fossil-burning power stations. But what if fossil fuels were replaced with renewable solar, wind, or water energy?\nHow to Get Electricity From the Sun\nSolar panels are a big part of how we use solar power. They use solar cells to collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. Solar cells used to be expensive and needed a lot of space, but now they\u2019re more affordable and more efficient.\nA solar panel has two parts:\nThe solar cell converts sunlight into electricity.\nThe battery stores the energy.\nSolar panels are built into rooftops and walls of buildings, which means they can be placed anywhere there is sunlight. They are also called photovoltaic (or \u201cPV\u201d) panels because they use light to make power.\nRenewables - How to Get Electricity For Free: How to Get Electricity\nPrevPrevious PostWhat Happens When Humans Colonize Mars\nNext PostWomens Leadership Workshop \u2013 Leadership SkillsNext\nBiden's climate chief says it doesn't matter if fossil fuel companies go bankrupt because of climate change\nClimate: \u2018Used all the wrong cards\u2019", "num_tokens_generated": 1359, "OGF": 0.331787109375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 31.174285650253296, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 593, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The two Florences are in different counties, but are very close to each other. Both Florences were small towns, but very different. The city of Florence, in Volusia County, was a railroad town, established in 1883 as part of the Florida Rock Land and Lumber Company, which owned the Ponce de Leone Land Co. of northern Florida. This town was also served first by the St. John\u2019s River Railroad, then by the Delray Coast Line of the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railroad, later by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, also part of the Florida Rock company holding. The town of Florence, in Putnam County, was 23 miles south of the city on U.S. 17 just north of Palatka, 28 miles or two hours south of Daytona Beach. Both Florences were near railroads, but not on the main line or main east coast route.\nAdd tags for 6-The History of Mount Home\nPost a Comment for 6-The History of Mount Home\n01 - The History of Mount Home", "num_tokens_generated": 585, "OGF": 0.142822265625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 13.118890762329102, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 594, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Do not confuse your response with answering the questions. Your response should give your own thoughtful answers based on your understanding of the issues. This essay will test your ability to formulate a thesis, support it with appropriate content, and develop a well-organized, properly supported, and correctly cited (APA) response. To earn points you must do all of these things. When you turn in your assignment to your professor, check the box verifying you have successfully answered the question(s) and cited each source exactly as you state that you have done so. You will lose points for inappropriate citation or lack of citation. You will lose points for the lack of content and/or development. You will lose points for any errors in paragraph structure or syntax. You will lose points if you submit the Assignment late. Note that inappropriate citation of your sources is defined as plagiarized source material or improper reference. Plagiarized source material generally includes copying information or ideas from one of your sources into an essay without the correct citation indicating the source of the material or idea or without giving credit in a manner approved by the APA, which allows you to use part or all of another writer's work. Improper reference includes placing a quote within your essay or writing your word-for-word interpretation/analysis of a source without the correct citation. In all these cases you will earn a grade of zero (0), and you will receive feedback notifying you of the consequences of your work. As a general rule, quotations should not, unless in dialogue (see text), be more than 40 words. If they are, it would be better to use paraphrase. Quotations, even when in dialogue, should never be excessive; they should serve to illustrate your own ideas, not to substitute for them. You should always use quotations with caution. In some cases, your professor may instruct you how to respond to the Assignment questions. For example, she may ask you to use only information from two sources to answer a question. If this is the case, the assignment description will include that instruction. In most cases, this assignment will allow you to choose all three (or more) sources used in the essay from the following suggested resources. However, if you wish to use sources outside those chosen here, the instructor may approve those sources for the assignment. If you are unsure if your resources meet the standards of quality and quantity, you may consult with your professor prior to submitting any work. You will need a title page: the title of the essay should be bold face. Write your name, student number, course information, and the name of your instructor across the top of the essay. Include a Reference in APA format. Your Essay should answer the question(s) with an introduction, body, and conclusion. The essay will be scored utilizing the following rubric and your grade will be based on your answer and your use of APA. RESEARCH AND CITATION STANDARDS: RESEARCH AND CITATION STANDARDS 1. 8.0 / 10.0 POINTS ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION: For this assignment, write an essay (2\u20133 pages in length, typed, double-spaced) using a minimum of 3 resources (books, online resources, or articles) from the list below or 2 additional references to support a well-developed thesis statement. Your essay will receive points based on the quality of writing and the content, correctness, and proper citation of any quotes or paraphrases from the sources. When evaluating your essay the professer will be scoring you on the following: Adequate and clear writing. Writing that con\u00adsistently uses correct grammar, spelling, and formatting. Correct use of APA formatting and style. In-text citations at the end of each paragraph and at the end of your essay. Referencing information for all in-text citations to your sources. A proper Reference page with a list of sources. Note that inappropriate citation of your sources (improper Reference or plagiarized source material/ideas) will result in a 0/10 point grade, and you will receive specific feedback to explain why. Plagiarized source material is defined as copying information or ideas from a source into your essay without the correct in-text citation noting the source of the material or idea. PARAGRAPH FORMATTING: A paragraph will be scored based on the three (3) necessary elements for a paragraph. They are: A topic sentence: a topic sentence may not be the first sentence of the paragraph; it is your claim, assertion, or supporting point of evidence. If it is the first sentence, it may be re\u00adwritten elsewhere and used as the topic sentence. Transitional Sentences: Each paragraph will start with a transition sentence (could be an action verb) to indicate the connection from the previous to the new paragraph. Concluding Sentence: this tells the reader the paragraph is completing; it generally is not a topic sentence. CORRECT PAPER FORMATTING: In addition to your 3 paragraphs and topic sentence, correct formatting of the paper will help you receive points. Page Format: The paper must be typed between two pages (not 2 pages single-sided) and should be A4 paper. Margins: Top: 1.5 inches; Bottom: 1.0 inches; Left: 1.0 inches; Right: 1 inch. Font: Size: 12 point Times New Roman Font PAGE HEADINGS: At the top of the page you will put in the following information: Student\u2019s Name: Title of essay: Date of essay: Essay type: Course Name: Instructor name: Assignment name: Your paper will be graded on correct formatting which may include all of the following: Submitting a paper with no titlepage, or with a page that is too long or too short will reduce score. This refers to paper length, margins, spacing, and font. Submitting an essay with a different fontsize, or page margins of no more than 1.5, or any margin smaller or larger than this, will reduce score. Citation and Reference must be included exactly as instructed (Apa) and there must be appropriate in-text citation for quotes/paraphrase. Essay should be in correct APA style. Use quotation marks for quotations. A minimum of 5 sentences per paragraph must be included. Incorrect formatting in an APA essay will significantly reduce the score. APA must be used for papers in order to avoid this. Correct APA citation for the sources, both within text in appropriate in-text citations as well as referencing correctly. For more information concerning APA documentation, consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (5th ed.).\nCitation is the most important part of an academic essay assignment and, as it happens, among the most common mistakes students make.\nDoing it wrong can get your paper thrown away, so it is best to take the time to do this aspect of writing right. When in doubt, always refer to your assignment instructions and citation rules carefully.\nFollow all of your instructor's assignment guidelines and pay particular attention to the type of citation and formatting methods they require.\nTIP: If your teacher wants your paper in MLA style while your school wants it in Chicago style, your teacher\u2019s requirements will be the ones followed, so make sure it\u2019s right!\nIf in doubt, always double-check with your assignment guidelines or your teacher to make sure you are meeting the expectations.\nTIP: When in doubt, check!\nCite Sources with Correct Formatting\nThe purpose of citing your sources is to allow your audience to see that your work is original and that it doesn\u2019t come solely from you, but also from outside sources.\nTherefore, your purpose is to inform the reader where ideas and information come from, and to lead the reader to their own independent interpretation of the topic.\nIt\u2019s the reason all of us are taught how to cite sources correctly and why we have a multitude of citation guides at our fingertips, all of which come in handy when writing an essay.\nThe best thing to do with citations and the bibliography is to double-check them with one of the sources you are given to study in class.\nThis is where you will learn the most about how to cite sources because you will go over them as part of writing an analysis of the text, but you will gain another benefit from doing that.\nTIP: Always check your paper with a citation guide to make sure it is formatted correctly.\nAn online citation generator can be a useful tool, but it should be used as a guide to assist you in creating the correct citation rather than as the final product.\nAn online citation generator is usually much easier to use and will give you all of the facts about citation that come up frequently, such as publication date, format of volume and issue, and the author\u2019s name.\nCiting your sources will make your paper look more professional and the citation guide you are given will help you do it the right way.\nFor the best bibliographical instructions or if you are unsure, check with your instructor.\nTIP: Remember to check with your instructor if in doubt!\nWhen there is no guide to help you, you can start with a brief citation and then fill in any important details, according to the source type.\nFor example, when the journal or website you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t have a date the work was published in, the citation will not include that, but if it does and you don\u2019t have that publication information, the citation will not have a publication date.\nThere are many different citation methods, depending on the course you are studying and the university you are attending.\nCitations and the bibliography will be one of the most important sections of your work. They help to strengthen your argument and increase the overall credibility of your work.\nYou will not need these instructions to cite a citation guide properly.\nHow to Write an Appendix in APA | Format and Tips\nWhen writing an academic paper for a class you will be required to write an appendix, usually of the table or data you presented to support part of your paper.\nFor the MLA style, the appendix is different and provides the full text of any poem, text, work of literature or play that the professor wishes to view, instead of just giving him a brief description\nTIP: To write a table, you will need to present it in the same style as you have in the paper, so make sure to have this correct.\nYou would include the appendix at the end of your paper instead. Your teacher might also ask for it, but this is the most common method.\nUsing an electronic format to create an appendix allows you to create a table easier, as it will be easier for your professors to view the information in the table with the information in the table.\nThis is also true for an MLA Style work, as you cannot show the entire text because your professor will have to get it out himself to read.\nThe MLA style also requires you to put the table title as part of your works cited, and not as part of the body of your work as you do for the APA style.\nHere are how you write an appendix in APA style.\nWrite the title in the center of your paper, with enough space in between to place a footnote with the table in it. In the MLA style, the title is centered and will include the author\u2019s name and the title of the poem in italics.\nThe table itself includes the rows and columns set up in a format that is the same as the one that you used in the text of your paper. You also need to set it up the same way that you did in your paper, using the same font and header format.\nFor a table that you will create, you can create and then paste the table in a Word document and then insert it into your paper using the Word template that is provided by Word.\nThis will save you time because it gives you the tools you need to set up your table in a format that is APA style. For an MLA-formatted table, you will need to create a new document and then input the text from the table.\nMake sure that you use the heading that you created earlier and use it again for the appendix. The text of the table will only include the actual text that you need to include in your paper.\nPlace an arrow below it and put a question mark below that.\nWrite the title in the center below the table.\nPut the title in title form (if the table is in bold lettering) and place it just after the title.\nPut the table description on the back of the paper, below the table.\nPut the table text and title on the front page, at the top center of the page.\nPlace the table title below the table and just before it.\nWrite the title in the center below the table. Put the title in title form (if the table is\nAPA Citation and Formatting - 2020 edition\nhttps://owlpaper.com/citation-examples/apa-citation-and-formatting\nCitation Format for APA Research. Citing and referencing information and facts, or ideas, are essential in academics and, particularly, in case you are doing any sort of research in any sort of discipline. Writing a paper in any sort of formatting system isn\u2019t difficult, but one important thing is always to comply with the instruction manual. The APA format has certain rules for citations to references that can help the reader know the research paper, which they are reading is credible. The American Psychological Association (APA) style is the most typical style used for research papers and is used in nearly all fields of academics. For this guide, we\u2019re going to use the second edition of the APA Publication Guide (2009). To cite articles, books, etc. in the APA style, we always have to cite the authors name, book name or URL. We need to also mention that the work is cited (APA 6.13, 6.14). In addition, we'll have to indicate the date of publication (APA 6.15). If your paper includes quotations, you'll be needing to indicate page numbers (APA 6.16).\nCiting and formatting in APA style: Quotation and paraphrases\nhttps://owlpaper.com/citing-and-formatting-in-apa-style-quotation-and-paraphrases/\nIf you\u2019re writing a paper or doing a research on psychology and other related fields, there is a possibility that you will use a specific quote or paraphrase from a source. In these examples, quotes may not be used as they do not conform to the requirements of the document. In APA style, you have to write quotes in parentheses. The quotation should also appear in italics or in quotation marks. This way, it will be clear to your readers that it is a quote.\nFormatting and Citing - Owlpaper\nhttps://www.owlpaper.com/citation-examples/formatting-and-citing\nIf you\u2019re writing an essay in MLA style, you should write your text in paragraph form, followed by your bibliography section. The bibliography section of the MLA is where you will list your sources and how you cite them. It\u2019s important to keep these two sections separate. You cannot just put everything in one file and create an MLA style assignment.\nPaper Format: MLA Formatting and Style Guide - Owlpaper\nhttps://owlpaper.com/paper-format-mla-formatting-style-guide/\nAPA: An Introductory Guide with Examples - Owlpaper\nhttps://owlpaper.com/apa-an-introductory-guide-with-examples/\nMany research fields use APA, so this style guide contains tips and information on APA formatting and APA reference page formatting. These are the key parts of a research paper and are important for researchers' work. The guide is available on the library blog of the University of Utah (University of Utah Libraries Blog, 2016).\nMLA Format: Quotes, Titles and Headings and MLA Format: Quotes\nIf you haven\u2019t done it in a long time or you have never done it before, it will be difficult for you to write something using a MLA style. You should never try to learn MLA style, but instead, you should check out the official MLA site, to see what the standards are like. The page where you will find the rules for the formatting of titles and headings in MLA style is called the \u201cPage Layout\u201d section. You can use this page to find out how to set up your page. This will ensure that you have done your best when formatting the pages in MLA style.\nProperly Formatting APA Paged Sources\nhttps://www.easybib.com/guides/advanced-guides/apacite-guide/properly-formatting-apa-paged-sources/\nCover Page in APA - EasyBib\u00ae Guide\nhttps://www.easybib.com/guides/writing-notes-and-outlines/apa-format/apa-format-the-cover/\nUsing Headings in APA - EasyBib\u00ae Guide\nhttps://www.easybib.com/guides/advanced-guides/how-to-cite/using-headings-in-apa/\nUsing a bibliography - Easybib\u00ae Guide\nhttps://www.easybib.comhow-to-cite/using-a-bibliography-bibliography-bibliography-bibliography\nIn MLa style - Easybib\u00ae Guide\nhttps://www.easybib.com/style/using-in-mla-style/la/in-mla-style\nHow to write a term paper in - Easybib\u00ae Guide\nhttps://www.easybib.com/guides/how-to-a/how-to-write-term-paper-in-a-term paper in APA style-owlbib\u00ae Guide APA formatting style in MLa term a paper?style in MLA style in term MLa MLA format-term styles of APA formatting A term paper inAP style styles of MLA\nAP styles of term paper in A term in A formatting and style-a APA\nhttps://www.easybibpaper in?\nhttps://easybib/formatting\nAn Introduction and A\nhttps://eay\nAPA\nA term?

The Ancients called the world after the earth-bearing goddess GAIA.\n. But where did this name actually come from? A new study has shown the term \"Hell on earth\" is more than 100 years younger than previously believed - dating to about 1875. To read the latest news from our world, you can join us to receive all the new updates by clicking the button below to subscribe to our newsletter (for free).\nAs we mentioned, the Hades theme on the Hellas website was part of an earlier project. The original site was hosted by OVH and is still up, albeit in a different form. For example, the Hades theme on the Hellas website has a lot of code to check for user-defined settings, among other things. If you go to hell.to, you will be redirected.\nThis is a very common occurrence that is often exploited by black hat hackers, who can steal sensitive information and use it to their advantage. The most popular way to do this is by using brute force techniques.\nIn this case, a hacking tool can be used to automatically attempt thousands or millions of different username and password combinations, using both common combinations and more obscure ones.\nWith these methods, an attacker can determine the exact username and password that a website is using, and in some cases even guess the website admin password. But it should be noted that this is not a viable means of cracking a website to an administrator, as often only a small percentage of password combinations are effective.\nIn addition, hackers can set up a botnet and use it to automatically search for vulnerable websites. When such a botnet is used, the attacker can have a team of thousands of bots working around the clock to find any and every vulnerable website on the Internet.\nHades theme. It is always used as a template for other hacktivist websites, while the original Hell.to website remains popular. There has been some speculation that the Hades theme is actually a front for a legitimate website, with many hacktivist websites using it as a template. In any case, it's a fairly popular site and a great resource for anyone interested in hacking or hacktivism.\nIt seems like Hades theme has been around forever, but this may not be the case. According to new research, Hades theme was actually created in 2023, which is surprising considering its popularity among hackers and hackers. The researchers found that the theme first appeared on the server on May 24, 2023 and was quickly adopted by many hacktivists all over the world. It is not clear how or why the theme gained popularity so quickly, but there is speculation that it may have been due to its unique design.\nThe Hades theme was created by the developers of Theme Hospital, who wanted to create an easy-to-use, affordable website theme that would let site owners customize the look and feel of their sites without the hassle of coding. As more and more websites adopted Theme Hospital's Hades theme, the site became increasingly popular with hackers and crackers, who were attracted to its functionality and ease of use.\nIn August 2023, a new version of Theme Hospital called \"Hades Rex\" was released, which included a number of improvements over the original version. For example, Hades Rex allowed users to create custom domains for their websites, making it easier for hackers and crackers to use Theme Hospital's themes.\nThe popularity of Hades Rex among hackers and crackers also led to its adoption by malware authors, who used it to create sites that infected visitors with malicious software.\nThe Hades theme was originally used on the Theme Hospital website by the developers of Theme Hospital. However, this was changed when the developers of Hades theme decided to use the Hades theme on their website instead.\nIt became very popular and many users of Theme Hospital started using Hades as an alternative to the original website theme. However, over time, the Hades theme became too popular and many users abandoned it for the original site theme. In 2023, a new website design emerged called \"Morgoth\" which was modeled after the original Hades theme.\nIt is easy to find websites based on Hades theme, as it is one of the most popular website themes on the internet. It is also easy to find hacktivist websites based on Hades theme, as these websites often have a very specific purpose for which they are designed.\nLast year, hackers started using Hades themes for their website attacks, and now new users are adopting the theme to build their websites. In the past, hackers used to use WordPress, but with the introduction of Hades theme, they switched away from WP because it wasn't secure enough and didn't give them the level of control they needed.\nNow, it seems that Hades theme is becoming the new standard for site hackers around the world. It has become more popular because it is very easy to customize and build.

We are glad to know the meaning of this technical term: cafmerc. You can define CAFMERC in many ways: It is a verbal form of the noun CAFMERS that is a word describing a particular activity relating to the CAFMERS, which relates to the practice of using air-flow for measuring the pressure at a point in a body of water or gas. The word was first used in 1871 by the English physicist W.H.M. Bark. An object's surface area is known as its surface area. For instance, a two-dimensional surface area of 0.1 mm. is measured using the millimeter per meter squared (mps/d). A surface area of 0.5 mm (s) equals 0.5 (1,000,000) mm sq. The surface area of the earth is measured by the area it covers. The surface area of water in a reservoir is measured by the volume of water it contains. The surface area of a body of water is known as the surface volume of the water, and is the volume of the surface area times the water's depth at its lowest point. An object that has a surface area is not covered by a surface, because it is surrounded by air. This means the total surface area is always greater than the surface area of any body of water. For the surface area measured by water is not covered by anything, a more compact term \"air-volume\" was coined in 1869, and a more precise term \"surface volume\nc-a-f-m-e-r-s-\nMeasurement is the process of measuring the amount of the physical phenomenon present in the body or object. By definition: A physical quantity is a quantity that is determined by the way it is measured. In the physical world, there is a distinction between qualitative and quantitative measurement. A qualitative quantity is measured by comparing a physical phenomena to a particular quantity. For example, a physicist can quantify the temperature of a room by measuring the volume of air that is in the room and comparing it to the temperature outside.\nAnother type of unit of measurement is the temperature. A temperature is a physical property that is measured in an environment. A temperature can also be referred to as a thermal property. For example, a thermometer can be used to measure the temperature outside in degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe temperature can be measured as either Celsius or Fahrenheit but is usually measured in Celsius. A device that measures temperature is called a thermometer. The unit that measures the temperature in Celsius is the Celsius degree, the unit used in most countries. The Celsius degrees are defined as degrees Fahrenheit.\nIn some countries, the Celsius is designated as degree Celsius or the Celsius point. The Celsius is the unit used when measuring the temperature of an object in terms of degrees Celsius. In the United States, the degree Celsius is known as degree Celsius and is used when measuring the temperature of an object.\nIn most European countries, the Celsius degree is used as the reference point when measuring the temperature for the degree Celsius. In the United Kingdom, the Celsius degrees is called the Celsius. Another term that is commonly used to describe temperature is the thermometer.\nA thermometer is a device that detects temperature by sensing and measuring the heat generated by an object's surface or by absorbing the heat of another object. The thermometer measures the temperature of an object relative to its surroundings. The thermometer may be used in a liquid environment so that heat is absorbed from the liquid. When the liquid is heated, the heat is then removed and the temperature is measured.\nThe device that measure temperature is the thermometers which come in a variety of different forms and are designed to detect heat and measure it in terms of Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, degree Celsius, and other temperature units. There are a variety of thermometers on the market today. These thermometers come in a variety of different shapes, sizes, colors, and materials. The thermometer measures temperature by sensing and measuring the level of temperature in degrees Celsius that a certain object is at. The measure of temperature is also known as the thermometer's measurement. The temperature measurement is the temperature that a temperature sensor measures.\nThere are three common types of temperature sensor:\nThermocouple sensor - uses a thermocouple to measure the temperature of an object.\nOptical sensor - uses an optical sensor to measure the temperature using light.\nThermal gradient sensor - used to measure the temperature inside a room.\nThe temperature range of a room is measured as temperatures from zero to a maximum temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (7.5 Celsius). The range of temperature inside a room can range from a maximum temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit to a minimum temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or lower and it is measured in degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe unit of measurement of temperature is defined as the standard temperature scale (i.e. degrees Celsius), which is the temperature of an object. A scale of this type can be found on a thermometer, scale of thermometer, or thermometer kit. It is also possible to express the temperature scale as a temperature range of degrees Celsius. This type of measurement is known as temperature range measurement.\nTemperature Ranges are measured in Celsius. The temperature range measurement is a measurement in which the temperature range is measured as a temperature range of a certain temperature in Celsius. The temperature range can range from 0 degrees Celsius to, possibly, 30 degrees Celsius. The range of temperature may be measured as a temperature scale (i.e. temperature ranging from 0 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius) or another type of temperature scale, such as a temperature range from 0 degrees Celsius in degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius or 0 degrees Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius.\nThe most commonly used temperature unit to measure the temperature is Celsius degrees (C). This measurement is used to measure the temperature of an object or system by comparing it with a temperature standard that was established at the time that the measurement of that temperature was performed. The Celsius unit was established as a standard in the early 1970s and is used to measure the temperature to determine the temperatures that are used to make scientific measurements.\nThe Celsius temperature measurement is also used for thermometers as it is the standard in the United States and in the United Kingdom.\nMost people do not know a single thermistor, but since the thermistor has a large temperature range that covers a large part of the environment, it can be considered a sensor.\nThe thermistor can be used to measure the temperature of a small object or a huge room, but it also measures the temperature range for a large object or large room that can be used for the measurement of a larger objects, a room, a space, or a building.", "num_tokens_generated": 1823, "OGF": 0.445068359375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 42.2294385433197, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 602, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

As an intern in the legal department, I worked one-on-one with a member of the Costa Rican parliament to create an environmental law based on Costa Rica\u2019s current state of affairs, its environmental and economic developmental needs and its need to be a sustainable leader on an international scale among its peers. I worked directly on this project with MINAE and its Costa Rican governmental counterparts such as the Ministry of Environment (MINAE) and the Public Policy Library (LAPO). This internship allowed me to understand the government\u2019s bureaucratic processes, to help the government write a piece of legislation and to learn about its environmental initiatives as they are being developed.

While this opportunity showed me how an international government creates policy and addresses and promotes sustainability issues, I would also like to take action in my local area. From the time I began work with MINAE, I developed a passion for addressing sustainability issues in developing countries, and particularly in Latin America. During my time as a student of Latin American history, the incompleteness of the democratic republics and the presence of extreme inequality in the Latin American countries left me extremely affected. From this work experience, I have learned that while democracy is often touted as the end-all of governmental structures, this is not the case. When I see the inequality in the Costa Rican population between the large urban and the extremely underdeveloped rural population, I am able to appreciate the complexities of these problems. Therefore, I would like to take this issue up closer to home.\nI was able to see how government works on an intricate level.\nRural populations around the world suffer from a lack access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation as well as the presence of diseases such as cholera and diarrhea due to lack of sanitation. In the United States, many rural populations are also underdeveloped but the differences are more apparent when the lack of access to resources is not just an issue of living in impoverished conditions but rather a result of geography that is further from developed cities. The need to address the need to improve access to sanitation and water is also exacerbated by the threat of climate change. As climate change brings droughts, desertification, disease and flooding, rural populations are also at an increased risk for lack of access to potable water and adequate sanitation. Therefore, I would like to create an international charity that addresses the need for clean drinking water for rural populations. The charity would work mainly with a target demographic of women in rural areas who need to access water as means to sanitize the water and to cook with it. As women are traditionally in the role of providing water for their families, I feel the need for clean water should be centered around them. In targeting women and their families, I would like to promote education and health standards for the entire family.\nMy project would give access to clean drinking water for rural populations.\nFurthermore, the charity will work as an initiative to build awareness of the environmental issues such as climate change and population growth that these rural populations face. For my Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) alignment, I choose the specific goal of SDG 6, clean water and sanitation for all, as I feel that the need for clean sanitation is a key component to the health and the education of these populations. My action aligns very closely with the first two goals of SDG 2. This SDG is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. My goal of providing access to clean drinking water and sanitation would promote adequate nutrition and sustainable agriculture by providing access to water that is also sustainable. My main challenge as a non-governmental organization would be to promote sustainability in my charity from the onset. The reason I believe I may be able to face this challenge comes from my time working in Costa Rica. At MINAE I was able to see how governments and agencies develop legislation that aims to be a catalyst for change that the private sector must then follow to ensure sustainability. Therefore, I would apply the same concept to my project. The challenge of ensuring that my charity provides the resources for rural areas in an environmentally sound manner is also present in the case of the Latin American countries that I have grown to love through my work experience in Costa Rica.\nMy action aligns very closely with the first two goals of SDG 2.\nWould you like to add information on a unique learning experience or academic/job growth that your resume doesn\u2019t include? (e.g. a unique project or internship; student organization leadership role; international/cross-cultural experience) My resume is pretty standard for someone with my background: I was a member of several clubs and organizations in college (including Women in Science and Technology, Business on Ice, Brewing Science Club and Brewing Club Manager, and Collegiate Chapter of the American Chemical Society). I served as the Undergraduate Student Representative for the Department of Chemistry/Biochemistry for both the Student Advisory Board for the College and for Faculty Advisory Council, but have been involved in other organizations on campus, including several Greek organizations such as Delta Phi Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta. My resume includes a list of internships in research and in environmental management that I worked in throughout my undergraduate career, as well as a variety of courses and laboratories that I took part in. However, this resume does not accurately reflect the experience, lessons, and passions that I have acquired throughout my undergraduate career, so below I provide a concise resume of my college career. I\u2019ve decided to leave an extra line to include my Moment in the Sun experience for the sake of additional detail and for a wider audience.\nSummer Internship in Costa Rica Moment in the Sun program \u2013 the summer intern program in Costa Rica\nThroughout the duration of this project I was placed as a legal assistant intern at the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) I experienced a unique opportunity to observe the intricacies of Costa Rican politics on a granular level. I felt like a cog in the vast wheel of Costa Rica\u2019s governmental workings. As an intern in the legal department, I worked one-on-one with a member of the Costa Rican parliament to create an environmental law based on Costa Rica\u2019s current state of affairs, its environmental and economic developmental needs and its need to be a sustainable leader on an international scale among its peers. Upon completion of this law, I accompanied my\nmentor throughout Costa Rica in presenting the legislation in an open forum setting. The open forum setting was interesting in my understanding of the culture and allowed me to see the social aspects of Costa Rica.\nThis internship allowed me to understand the government\u2019s bureaucratic processes, to help the government write a piece of legislation and to learn about its environmental initiatives as they are being developed.\nExperienced a unique opportunity to observe the intricacies of Costa Rican politics on a granular level.. I felt like a cog in the vast wheel of Costa Rica\u2019s governmental workings.\nGrowing up in the mountains in southeast Georgia, the majority of my family owned their own trucking and logging business, so\nMy summer internship in Costa Rica provided an opportunity to immerse myself in the culture and to\nacquire first-hand knowledge on the environmental initiatives and policies that are being developed to address the issues. I experienced my time living and working in a foreign country as an enormous cultural shift from the way of life in the southeast United States, where\ngrew up. Overall, my summer internship in Costa Rica provided an opportunity to immerse myself in the culture and to acquire first-hand knowledge on the environmental initiatives and policies that are being developed to address the issues. For the sake of time, I\u2019ll omit the following description:\nThe majority of my summer homework in Costa Rica consisted of translations and the collection of data in order to conduct research on the law with my internship advisor.\nThe majority of my internship consisted of translations and the collection of data in order to conduct research on the law with my internship advisor, as well as the organization of the documents involved in our case and the completion of the legal processes that would go on to form our legal arguments. Additionally, I often went to the local markets with my internship advisor to learn more about the local culture of Costa Rica.\nWhile this opportunity showed me how an international government creates policy and addresses and promotes sustainability issues, it was difficult for me to appreciate this information on a personal level, as I had never been in an immersive cultural environment prior to my trip.\nThe majority of my time was spent with the Ministry of Environment and Energy in San Jose. Costa Rica\nAs a member of the Costa Rican parliament, my mentor helped me to see first hand how the legal department dealt with issues such as bribery and how they dealt with members of the population who were unfit to do business in the country.\nis a democratically elected government. As a student from the United States, it was difficult for me to appreciate this information on a personal level, as I had never been in an immersive cultural environment prior to this summer abroad.\nThroughout this summer, I not only learned a great deal about Costa Rica, I learned a great deal about myself. From this new environment, I saw the world in new ways and gained perspective on my life at home, including the social aspects, work environment, and governmental structure of my home country. I saw Costa Rica, which has one of the highest literacy rates in the Americas and one of the lowest infant mortality rates, as a developing country, but this is not my first experience with that type of population. After visiting Haiti last spring and during the summer of my senior year of high school, I was exposed to third world conditions. This experience helped me to understand the difference in these two countries and the different developmental stages of their peoples. From this experience in Costa Rica as an intern with MINAE, I had the opportunity to get a closer look into the lives of the Costa Rican people.\nThe summer internship in Costa Rica gave me the opportunity to work together to help develop a law.\nAs a native English speaker from the United States, my internship advisor often spoke to me in Spanish and often needed me to translate his Spanish into English and his English into Spanish. He is Costa Rican and his level of English fluency is better than my level of Spanish fluency, so I helped him to translate often. I found that one of the most difficult aspects of this internship was the language barrier. I had two years of Spanish under my belt and I\nfelt like I was a beginner. Soon, I found myself translating things that I knew didn\u2019t really make sense. I\u2019m still really\nconfused as to the actual law that we worked on and am hoping I will be able to read it, or be allowed to access it, in English when I go to visit again in the future.\nGrowing up in the mountains in southeast Georgia, the majority of my family owned their own trucking and logging business, so I grew up around working on a construction site, operating heavy machinery, etc. I\u2019m proud to say that my family business had a strong environmental policy and often used their company to promote environmental consciousness in the greater community. My summer internship in Costa Rica provided an opportunity to immerse myself in the culture and to acquire first-hand knowledge on the environmental initiatives and policies that are being developed to address the issues. I loved having the opportunity to see the actual impact of this kind of environmental change in action. However, I found it\nWhile this opportunity showed me how an international government creates policy and addresses and promotes sustainability issues, I found it difficult to appreciate this aspect of my experience on a personal level, as I had never been in an immersive cultural environment prior to this trip.\ndifficult to appreciate this aspect of my experience on a personal level, as I had never been in an immersive cultural environment prior to this trip. In hindsight, I will say I wish that I had made an effort to visit the actual construction sites that my work was done to affect. I understand Costa Rica is not as large of a country as the United States, but it would have been nice to see some of the environmental projects to which I was writing laws to implement. I\u2019m sure it would have given me further insight into my career choice, as well as further appreciation of the work done by my internship advisor. My work as a summer intern in Costa Rica was mostly paperwork, but my mentor was a very passionate about sustainability in Costa Rica and in the rest of the world. I never had a doubt that I was doing good work, but at the same time I was doing research and writing as opposed to building water treatment facilities or reclaiming agricultural land.\nwas doing good work, but at the same time I was working as an intern and not building water treatment facilities or reclaiming agricultural land.\nHowever, I found it difficult to appreciate this aspect of my experience on a personal level, as I had never been in an immersive cultural environment prior to this trip.\nHire us as your resumesupport company and get a perfectresume.\nThrough this internship I not only gained first-hand knowledge on international environmental policy, I also gained a new appreciation for the impact that legislation has on the greater society. I was working on an environmental law that could potentially impact the lives of millions of uneducated people in Costa Rica, and the fact that this will have a lasting legacy is truly an inspiring thing. I believe that the law will make positive change in Costa Rica\u2019s economy and in its relationship with the environment; it\u2019s just unfortunate it will never be read by the people who need it most. Another reason that is was inspiring to me was that I was writing this law for Costa Rica. I am American and I did not grow up with the same challenges related to poverty as people in Costa Rica. I believe this experience truly affected the way I see my job as an advocate for sustainability and as someone who wants to work to improve the lives of others. This summer was a perfect time for me to have this experience because it allowed me the opportunity to be immersed in a culture that was both different and fascinating to me.\nMy time spent in Costa Rica during this summer was fascinating, and I truly enjoyed it. It is a beautiful country, and despite its relatively small size, there are huge differences in the living standards of some Costa Ricans and others.\nThis summer I gained a much deeper appreciation for the culture within Costa Rica, a country that is my second home, as well as a deeper understanding of the various aspects of Costa Rican life and how those impacted the creation of the legislation that I was writing. I believe that I have gained perspective, compassion and empathy through this experience. This summer was a perfect time for me to have this experience because it allowed me the opportunity to see how the people who live in Costa Rica are living, and learn more about their daily lives and their cultures.\nIf you like this, buy Resumesupport as Resumesupport.net, We always try to give better resumes for your career.\nResume Support: Resume Writing Services for Professionals : Resume Support\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r23WCb5H4l0]\nResume Support: Resume Writing Services for Professionals\nBased in Washington, D.C., Resume Support is the leading professional resume Writing Services Company.

It's a game for the ages, a game that you'll have in your heart and on your shelf, a game that you will tell your kids about as your grandkids are running around the house. It's a game of legend.\nThe Last of Us Part II is just as great as we hoped it'd be. It's violent, heart-breaking and thoughtfully delivered.

I'd heard loads about it before I played it, and I'd read that it might be too gory for me, but I don't think there's anything gory in the game. It's just a wonderful experience from beginning to end, and a game that I'd recommend to everyone.\nThe long overdue second installment of the Tomb Raiders franchise was quite disappointing. It is a game of average quality, where you can expect a bit of fun and a bit of a headache at the same time. It is still a decent game to play if you are a fan of RPGs and/or Tomb Raiders. But the Tomb Raider franchise should've become the best Tomb Raider game this decade, and not just for the simple plot and a bit of extra depth to the story.\nThe long lost dungeon crawler and party adventure game reborn.

I would definitely recommend it to people looking for fun.\nThe long awaited return of one of the most beloved franchises in video game history is finally here, and in its most powerful and exciting form to-date. In an age where people have become so much less creative with their gaming experiences, it's refreshing to see a game that can still offer you a sense of familiarity, while still offering a story that is far more mature and complex than before. It's also great to see a game that doesn't rely on combat as a main weapon, and instead relies on your skill to succeed. If you're looking for a game that can last an hour, The Last of Us is it.\nThis game has a great storyline and gameplay, i like the idea of playing as an enemy and a good girl at the same time. The gameplay is quite fun and the graphics are beautiful. I really like the style and the music. I also like the main character and how her voice is heard. The levels are not very big and the puzzles aren't very hard but they're good. There are also a lot of dialogue that are worth listening to. I think there should be a lot more of that in the next episodes. The game is great for people who want to get the best out of VR because the controls are very intuitive and it is easy to play that way. I got into this game the first time I played it and I was hooked. I recommend it to people who like games like The Walking Dead and Fallout 4.\nOkay, I feel like I\u2019m being picky, but I do not like how The Last of Us Remastered has a story that doesn\u2019t make sense. It feels like they were trying to get me to play a game that was unplayable. There are a lot of other games I would rather play. I was expecting something more, but I feel like I got a short game with a few story changes. For example, the final scene of The Last of Us Part II is very different from the ending of The Last of Us. I\u2019m not going to lie, I still like the idea of the story of The Last of Us Part II being unplayable. However, I\u2019m sure it would be okay if they actually implemented it somewhere down the line, like another game. The Last of Us Remastered looks pretty cool in black and white. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s not great in the story department. However, I like the idea of this game being playable. I\u2019m not going to lie, I still like the idea of this game being playable. I\u2019m not going to lie, I still like the idea of this game being playable.

Its a classic game and you should try this game out. The game is so realistic and its so easy to play. This game is very fun to play. I don't have much to say but this game is great. Great graphics great great gameplay this game is a classic. I recommend this game to everyone. Its a classic and its a big classic. If you like the games from Capcom then you should buy this game.\nThis is a really fun game, but also a really challenging one. It is also a very large game and I would not recommend playing it unless you are very dedicated to finishing the game. The game is divided into sections, each with a specific quest. You have to figure out what to do at each section, how to solve the puzzle and how to complete the quest you are given. There are a lot of things to find, many of which are extremely hard to find. I would recommend this game for people who like puzzles, as well as people who like big, challenging games.\nI have been waiting for this game for too long, but I finally have it. I am very satisfied with it, it is so realistic and looks beautiful, I love the cutscenes, and the story is amazing and keeps you wanting more. It is a very fun game to play and it is so much fun to play as a stealthy ninja. It is also very challenging, but as long as you have the patience to learn the stealth, you can beat the campaign without many problems.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a great game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout it's entirety. It's a game that focus on story and character more than combat. The game is very well done and you'll have your hands and arms on the controller the whole time. I was very satisfied with the story from start to finish and was glad that I was able to finish it in one sitting. I would recommend it to anyone.\nThe Last of Us 2 is a fantastic game and one that I will remember for a long time to come. I like the story, the gameplay, the graphics, and it's definitely one of my favorites. I can't wait to buy the game and play it again.\nI have been a big fan of Naughty Dog since playing Crash Bandicoot 2 on the SNES as a kid. So it should be no surprise that I am excited to follow this franchise into the new generation of consoles. Naughty Dog has been one of the mainstays in the gaming industry since their debut title, Crash Bandicoot and I know that this next entry into the franchise will be one of the best games that I have ever played. And I am not alone in this as there seems to be a lot of buzz being generated with The Last of Us. Naughty Dog has been on an adventure in the gaming industry and this latest entry is a good example of what this team is made of. I am a huge fan of this series as well as all other Naughty Dog franchises and I am sure that The Last of Us will have me hooked for a long time to come. Naughty Dog has truly created a game with a lot of heart and soul and I look forward to experiencing it and witnessing the journey that Naughty Dog has been on for over 18 years. The Last of Us has a lot to offer for fans of Naughty Dog and I am sure that this game will be one of the best games of the year. The Last of Us is an awesome new game from Naughty Dog. The game is very well-designed and the gameplay and story is brilliant. The characters are well-developed and the atmosphere is amazing. The gameplay is very well-balanced and I really enjoyed the game.\nIt is a very good game and you need to have some patience. It is a very easy game, but it is very important to take your time. It is also a very good game to replay again in the future. It is a very good game for a single player or for a multiplayer game.", "num_tokens_generated": 2119, "OGF": 0.517333984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 49.75827598571777, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 608, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Protect your health and family.\nProtect your family and pets by eliminating pet hair, allergens, dust, pollutants, mold and mildew, odors and 99.97% of viruses and bacteria from the air. The LongHome Air Purifier is specifically designed for the home and is portable to be moved from room to room. Pets and families spend more time indoors where the concentration of allergens, dust and odors can greatly increase. By using an air purifier to get rid of allergens, dust mites and pets dander, we can reduce the chance of allergy and asthma attacks. LongHome has a HEPA filter that traps 99.70% of dust, dander, pet hair, and airborne particles and is the only HEPA filter that removes the dangerous and toxic element of Formaldehyde, reducing and eliminating harmful formaldehyde, in addition to all other toxins from your home. As a result, pets and your family can breathe easier and their lungs and immune system will benefit from cleaner indoor air.\nWhile traditional air purifiers can only remove airborne particles larger than the filter size, the HEPA filter used in LongHome HEPA purifiers is able to trap the smaller, harmful particles that a HEPA and Ionizer combination air purifier just cannot. The LongHome HEPA filter can capture particles as small as .1 microns as well as any harmful gases such as formaldehyde, benzene, VOCs and other noxious vapors, all common byproducts of everyday life.\nLongHome Air Purifiers contain an Electrostatic Air filter. Electrostatic air cleaners use high-voltage electrostatic fields to charge particles, attract them to charged plates and remove them from the cleaned air. LongHome uses an electrostatic air filter instead of a charcoal filter like competitive air purifiers.

I'm not getting any pay raises or promotions. I even went and got an MBA so that I could better position myself. It just seems like I'm stuck. I work hard, but I don't get ahead. This job isn't what I want to do long-term, I want to work in the entertainment industry, and specifically, I want to be a sports commentator. It's what I'm passionate about and what I want to do. The problem is that my job is what I do to survive. I need to make a significant change. I'm young and I'm not too worried about the financial stability, but it's just getting worse and worse that I'm feeling so stuck. I could be doing what I want to do with my life and career, but I'm scared to take a risk.\nDear Stuck!,\nThanks for reaching out for your second career coaching session. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019ve hit a snag on your journey and that not only is your desire for change strong but your need for a career change is present. I think I may have been given a unique situation to help you. It seems we\u2019ll be able to connect you to someone in entertainment. Your sports commentator skill is definitely transferrable to sports broadcasting. I\u2019m pretty confident that if I reach out again in a couple of weeks, we might find someone that will be a great career boost for you. My goal is to keep you inspired and moving forward.\nFor today, we\u2019ll focus on you taking action in your job now and being inspired by an idea and what inspires you. I\u2019m so curious how you can be so happy at work some days, but then so frustrated and bummed out some days. I bet you have some key insights about this. It sounds like you\u2019re doing everything right to climb the ranks. You\u2019re working hard and you\u2019re taking courses that further your career. What would it look like to you if you could get ahead at work? Describe the kind of person you\u2019d be working with at your dream job. What would that do for you? It's important to visualize what you want or you won't be able to recognize it when it comes to you.\nWhen you\u2019re at work, I\u2019d love to know how I can help you shift your mindset. You\u2019re going to make a difference when you have more appreciation for what it takes to get promoted. I find when my own students do really well in their career, they\u2019re the people who are the happiest with their results and in appreciation of what their journey will look like. So, how can I help you to start appreciating the process?\nI don't envy you. Getting ahead at work and trying to find that right career move has its ups and downs. I do know you have the energy, drive and motivation to make it happen. Your desire to make a difference may not be as great as the desire to change your job, but as you learn to appreciate the process and your journey, hopefully what you love about your current job right now makes you love it, even more. I'm sure we'll get to that. There are also some other benefits that come from working hard and being a diligent student. While I don't mind that you want to be a sports commentator, I would like to encourage you to continue working hard at your current role. I love that you want to make a difference. It's important for me and for you to learn how to love your work, wherever you are along your journey.\nYou know what? We can try again after we tackle some of these issues, and talk about the career move. In the meantime, I know that a positive attitude and taking inspired action makes people move forward in their careers faster. For today, our focus should be on getting a strong hold on your future and knowing that success is not a straight line. I encourage you to be creative in your desire for change and to not limit yourself, but to expand your mindset and appreciate the process. You may still be stuck in the middle of changing careers, but I want to see you change the way you view your current situation.\nI\u2019m so looking forward to our next call.\nWhat's Your Biggest Career Setback & Why Are You Proud of It?\nI have worked in sales and marketing for a number of years. I had to sell one product that had to be shelf stable for almost two years. It was a pretty good gig, but the hours were terrible, the location wasn\u2019t great, and I don\u2019t want to move to another part of the country at this time in my life. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t had much of a desire for that since I\u2019ve gotten older and started my family, which I love and I can\u2019t bear to leave them right now. So, my husband and I have decided that I\u2019m going to go to college now and become a nurse. I\u2019ve applied to a local community college, but I wonder if there is something else I can do? I feel kind of stuck.\nThat was a great job change story. I really appreciate how you were honest and upfront about a couple of challenges that could come up when you make the career change. First I want to ask you what made you get up and get going on your journey towards becoming a nurse. I'd like to know what made you decide to pursue it now? Why that decision at this time?\nHonestly, my biggest concern right now is time. I\u2019m 36 years old. It probably sounds like a cliche\u0301 that I would say that, but I\u2019m really passionate about becoming a nurse and saving lives, and I really want to give something back. After hearing that description, I can truly sense the energy and courage you have surrounding your future career choice. The one piece I wasn\u2019t really clear on is what made you feel stuck.\nI was a stay-at-home mom for a while, but I have actually done marketing for five years now, and I\u2019m doing the night shift now. That means I have to put my kids to bed and I get up again at three o\u2019clock in the morning to make it to work on time. If I go back to school, then I\u2019m getting up again at probably five-thirty in the morning, getting the kids ready for school. That\u2019s going to be pretty difficult. My husband is going to need to drive us two boys to school at around 6:15, and I guess with me going to school, I\u2019m also going to be needing to carpool for my younger son. My husband will be at work and I have two little kids at school, and I\u2019m at college\u2026I\u2019m just wondering, what's going to happen with the kids? And with my husband being home alone, will I feel more comfortable if he\u2019s there, or if I\u2019m being home alone during the day and taking night classes all the time? That is my only concern right now, I guess. I\u2019m just wondering, \"What\u2019s going to happen?\"\nI can\u2019t tell you how important it is to let things become clear in our minds as we decide what to do and what step to take next. When there is a big question, and a big decision we need to make, that\u2019s the last thing we want to do is make a life changing decision based solely on assumptions. How do you feel that you don\u2019t feel confident that you\u2019ll be ready to go back to school?\nThe time commitment that you just mentioned is a huge challenge. It sounds like you\u2019re ready and you\u2019re passionate about pursuing this new career path, so why are you hesitating to go to college right now?\nI definitely am. It\u2019s going to be difficult\u2026I\u2019m just going to need a lot of help. I think the biggest thing is what happened in my life recently is the fact that I lost my dad. It was an instant thing. I feel like when we lose someone, especially someone close to us, and someone so special, it can really hit us hard. I feel like, \"Okay. This is it.\u201d I already miss him so much. I feel like I am not confident that I\u2019m going to be able to go back to school right now.\nMy God, it happens way too often and I\u2019m really sorry to hear it. I know that losing anyone dear to you can be devastating, but I want to help you see there\u2019s something even more powerful about losing someone. I love how you took the time to grieve and be with your family, and still move forward with your career. You lost a significant person in your life, but what\u2019s even more meaningful than a life changing setback is a career or life change you made because of it. You just might be a perfect fit for this career and have something more to offer in the future. The world needs more nurses, but the world needs more people who are truly committed to nursing because of the passion that burns inside of them.\nI really enjoyed our conversation because I think sometimes people think we\u2019re not supposed to bring up career setbacks, but we\u2019re supposed to act like they don\u2019t occur. Well, they do and they can change us. A significant setback or turning point in your life creates an opportunity to discover who you are, how you feel about what\u2019s been happening in your life and sometimes what you don\u2019t want. Those setbacks and significant events that occur are so much needed to bring us forward in our life. So I\u2019m really encouraged by your story of how you were brought forward because of a significant event in your life.\nNow I have another question. You just mentioned your husband and you sound proud of your decision to do something for people other than your children. You are going to be saving someone\u2019s life because when I was growing up, nursing was not a career women really chose. It wasn\u2019t considered a viable career or choice for women. I loved you saying that you want to save someone\u2019s life because you are making the career jump because you want to give back. You are making a jump that is going to make an impact on the lives of so many people and I encourage you to recognize that. It is something you are proud of.\nI know one of my favorite things to do is to coach my students to recognize how they can have pride in their careers and in their lives. I believe it will help you feel more inspired and confident in going back to college and feeling like you had a setback along your journey. It's really difficult to see a career setback because a goal is not reached, but when we have an opportunity to see the gifts of what life has given us, we become more clear as to the next direction.\nWell, I am really proud of you. It is a significant achievement and I want you to continue to have pride and appreciation for your journey. Sometimes we can forget that we\u2019ve made steps further than we thought we would. It's important to realize that we have control over our goals and our career so we must be the one to find the best opportunity.\nI totally appreciate how you can be proud of your situation and also of where you want to go from here. Thank you so much for your story and inspiration. I want to thank you for finding me, and I can\u2019t wait until we are together coaching again so that I can see that you are making the best decisions for your career and life too. The world needs more confident, passionate women like you.\nHow Can I Apply for a Job When I Have to Care for My Child?\nI live in California, and I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom. It\u2019s a really tough decision to stay at home, and I don\u2019t really regret it. But financially, it\u2019s a bit of an issue right now. The kids are getting older and they\u2019ve been in preschool and kindergarten for a few years. I think it would be best if I went to work. However, I need someone to be there with my child. I know that sounds like an issue with my child, and I don't want anyone else to be there but me. I'm just not sure. I don't know how I can be a mom and work. It's extremely hard sometimes to get up in the morning and get to my child. But then it\u2019s really hard to get to a job too if I do get one. I\u2019m not sure how I can put myself out there and look for an opportunity.\nThanks for reaching out for career coaching and let me be the first one to say congratulations on your decision to go back to work. I can\u2019t tell you what a major achievement this is. I know that it is not always easy to make this type of decision, but I think once you put your head down and you apply for jobs, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll feel really, really proud of yourself. In the meantime, let me give you some tips on getting the job you want to be working in the position that is going to allow you to take care of your child and your home.\nFirst, I would love to know what kind of work you\u2019re looking to do. Then, I have a few questions for you about your resurgence in work. First off, how do you think you\u2019ll be doing getting dressed every day and having to be early? I think I know the answer to that question because I would love to know when you last worked and what you were doing, what kinds of jobs you\u2019re looking at applying to now. I\u2019m just trying to put a picture at the back of my mind of what life might look like if you get to get to work and what will you have to face in the morning when you get the kids ready and off to school. Are you going to be able to make your work commute?\nI\u2019m sure we can address those issues. Right now, I\u2019m really looking forward to helping you with the opportunity to be open-minded about your career path. Let\u2019s focus for a while on the kinds of jobs you should be applying to for sure.\nAs far as what kind of jobs you\u2019re looking at, I\u2019m just going to guess. Are you trying to look at something that will allow you time to be at home? I want to help you come up with a strategy for finding the positions that you\u2019re going to look at and for how you\u2019re going to apply for jobs. I might be slightly biased since I\u2019ve been married to a nurse, but I know how hard it is, on top of that, to find someone to babysit at two in the morning. I think the best thing someone should do would be to apply for positions that would allow you to be at home and take care of your children and your home at the same time. As long as we don't try to tell someone what they have to do, how about if we focus on what kinds of jobs you could look at instead, that would make the process of applying to be easier.\nWhat I want to encourage you to do is keep the door open for a dream career down the road. Your first job is going to be an entry level job. I\u2019m telling you that with such love in my heart. So, you\u2019re going to be in line with making coffee and getting to take care of the kids at home. If you want your dream job later down the road, let\u2019s start with the entry level job. That way you can get the experience for the role that you want later on. That\u2019s going to give you the opportunity to interview for what you want. It's important to try hard to find an employer that understands you and what you're trying to do.\nI encourage you to look for opportunities to showcase the skills you already have, but that doesn\u2019t yet show in your resume. I love that you\u2019re bringing up the children and being a mom. You need to think of it as a skill and your children as a talent. You\u2019re a mom and you already have the skills to bring all of your responsibilities together while making sure that your children are okay. You really want to think about that while you apply and when you interview.\nOne of the things I find really interesting is that the people who get their kids in the best school districts end up having the strongest careers. That might not be the focus on what you\u2019re trying to accomplish immediately. One of the things you can think about during the interview process is the importance of putting your children in the best schools. Then once you get the interview, think of how you\u2019re going to show that you want them to have that opportunity. You never know what you\u2019re going to get when you\u2019re looking for a job. All I know right now is where you are and what your concerns are. It seems like the biggest concern is the school district.\nI\u2019m so encouraged to hear you\u2019re going to apply for jobs. I want to give you a few more specific suggestions for applying. I know the hardest thing to do is apply for jobs. Try to be as patient as you can and focus on one job at a time. Don\u2019t try to apply for every job that is out there. Pick the ones you're most interested in. Try to focus and not apply to as many jobs as you can. Try to apply to maybe one or two jobs a day. Do that while the kids are home. When they\u2019re in school, you\u2019ll have more time to apply. By the end of the day, I bet you\u2019re so tired. Apply for a job and then call it a day. Do that for a week or two and then reevaluate where you stand in the job search. It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed.\nNow I want to focus on the interview. When you\u2019re interviewing for a job, a lot of my advice would be to prepare so much for the interview process. I\u2019d say there is never a question at the very front that asks you about kids. In any conversation with the interviewer, the interviewer is always trying to find out what it is that makes someone unique and valuable to the organization. They are trying to discover the skill sets and the qualities that make you the right person for the job. As they are going through and trying to figure out what makes you great at your career, they always have an opportunity to tell you how they\u2019re going to use the opportunity the job is going to give you in your life. They will also ask other candidates how they plan to use their opportunity.\nThat is how interviews work. I encourage you to have a family conversation, or a story of how this role could help you make your family situation better. You could focus on the kids and how a family a story could positively help change how this job change my job my child.\nOne key point I want to bring is that they know that they know how I know them know I\u2019m they\u2019re I don\u2019t know how I am I need to know how are they don\u2019t know how me on if they\u2019re not to know how know how I\u2019m not how them to know them to I don\u2019t I could I can\u2019t I\u2019m an I don\u2019t I should I\u2019m an I I just don\u2019t\nI know that you could I\u2019m so they\u2019ll\nknow what you'll be able you're not going to say to the end of this is not\nhow about\nThis career change how to go to how it's family about how you could not to talk about how it's how the role has been done about what a it and I think I started how to think about the middle of how will start to middle I am I know how a I will to be able to be around I know how to the end I\u2019m not have an how I will I find my how I ever work out how to do it.\nnot an interview.

The light-dependent reaction, also known as the \u201cphoto- synthesis stage,\u201d is the initial stage in which light energy is absorbed and used to produce ATP and NADPH. These molecules are then used in the light-independent reaction, which is responsible for the production of carbohydrates. Chlorophyll is a molecule found in the chloroplasts of plants and other algae that absorbs light and helps in the photosynthesis process. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into chemical energy, which is then used to produce carbohydrates. In addition, chlorophyll also helps in the absorption of water and carbon dioxide. Chlorophyll is a key component of the process of photosynthesis, as it helps in the conversion of light energy into chemical energy that can be used by living organisms. Can you explain what role chlorophyll plays in photosynthesis? r longHOME fog brainactual HEADING PARAGRAPH: Chlorophyll plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. It is responsible for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is then used to produce carbohydrates. Chlorophyll also helps in the absorption of water and carbon dioxide. In addition, chlorophyll helps in the trapping of solar energy and the conversion of this energy into chemical energy. This helps in the production of carbohydrates, which is essential for the survival of plants. Can you define what is meant by \u201ccarbohydrates\u201d and how are they important in photosynthesis? r longHOME fog brainactual HEADING PARAGRAPH: Carbohydrates are important in photosynthesis as they provide energy for the cellular processes of the plant. Carbohydrates are also used as a source of energy in the form of glucose, which is necessary for the cells of the plant to produce energy.

To understand the mechanisms of energy transduction in living systems. Molecular Biology of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad 2 What is Photosynthesis? Energy Production by Natural Resources: Light (solar energy), Air (oxygen), Water (H2O), Minerals (Ca2+, K+, \u2026 etc.) Photosynthesis is the process in which organisms like green plants, algae, and certain bacteria use the energy from sunlight to convert CO2 to organic compounds like Glucose. It is mainly used by plants and algae, which are producers in an ecosystem. Photosynthetic bacteria are not a major source of organic carbon in ecosystems of Earth. A key characteristic of photosynthesis is the use of light energy to reduce carbon dioxide and water and synthesize carbohydrates from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) via ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) regulated by light dependent and independent reactions. Plants synthesize glucose, sucrose and starch from carbon dioxide and water using energy from sunlight. Most of the organic carbon in living organisms on Earth ultimately derives from photosynthetic organisms on Earth ultimately derives from photosynthetic organisms. Photosynthesis in green plants is a complex biochemical process in which carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, by using energy from sunlight. The process of photosynthesis is carried out by chlorophyll pigments and associated proteins in plants. Some bacteria also use photosynthesis to perform respiration with some organic food. A few protists and eukaryotic algae like plants and green algae have photosynthetic pigments. Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light dependent reaction that converts photons into the energy stored in ATP and NADPH. Then the light independent (non-light dependent) reaction involves the reduction of RuBP to produce glucose and the storage of carbon in the form of starch.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Photosynthesis in Nature: Photosynthesis is used by many plants for food production. The photosynthetic ecosystem comprises an intricate and highly organized community of microorganisms, plants and animals. In plant biology photosynthesis is studied in detail not only in an environment where plants are growing, but also in isolated cells from various organisms, with the goal of increasing the knowledge about photosynthetic processes. The primary function of photosynthesis is to use light energy to convert atmospheric components (such as carbon dioxide and water) into organic materials. Some of the organic molecules produced by photosynthesis are simple substances such as glucose and gases such as oxygen and water, are then passed on to living organisms, where they are used to store energy and serve as raw materials for the synthesis of the complex organic compounds.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Photosynthesis has enormous importance in biological sciences. Photosynthesis is a process in which atmospheric CO2, H2O, and solar energy is converted to carbohydrates. A major portion of atmospheric carbon is stored in plant tissues. In spite of photosynthesis being such a valuable process in many environments, only about one percent of the earth's photosynthetic activities contribute to the production of organic carbohydrates (for example in form of fruits and roots). The processes which are responsible for photosynthesis are complex, but it is well established that they can all be defined in terms of electron transfer. When light-activated pigment molecules are used to drive proton transfer, electrons and protons are transferred, and then returned to the photosystem pigments, providing energy for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad The light harvesting reaction captures the most energetic light, which is later transferred to another light-activated reaction center to begin the electron transport cascade to produce NADPH. Chlorophyll a pigment molecules (Chl-a) absorb light having a longer wavelength in the blue range of the visible spectra. Chl-a is a key structural component for the chloroplast, which is the energy storing organelle in plants. Plants also contain other photosynthetic pigments, notably Chl-b. They are present in all types of green tissues, except under leaves and stems, where they are involved in other photosynthetic processes. In addition, plants have carotenoids (such as lycopenes), which are similar to Chl-b in that they are produced in the same chloroplast, and can be found within the chloroplast itself, and they can be found in leaves, and other green tissues.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Chlorophyll (Chl) -a is a major source of energy for plants and other photosynthetic organisms. The energy harvested by chlorophyll molecules is stored in bonds between carbon and hydrogen. Chl-a is an integral part of photosystem II (PSII), and is responsible for turning over the sun's energy to produce oxygen, and to drive the light-dependent stage of the nonphotochemical phase I (NIP 1) reaction. Photosynthetic organisms use light energy to make carbon dioxide and other inorganic compounds into organic materials, for example into glucose or oxygen that is then used for energy and for the growth of new biomass. The main components of plants which are involved in photosynthesis are ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and ATP. Rubisco uses energy from ATP to catalyse the reversible conversion of ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate, and the simultaneous transfer of CO2 to the organic acids.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Rubisco is the most widely studied enzyme in plants, and is found in all leaf areas and is the catalyst for the final step in photosynthesis, the CO2 fixation step. Photosynthesis in plants is carried out by green pigment molecules, which can be divided into two types: photosystem II and photosystem I. Both are present in plants, but only in plants and their algae relatives do they work together. The two main systems are responsible for the light harvesting reactions, and these play a vital role in the photorespiration reaction, which involves the use of oxygen to make the final product, glucose.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad The reactions carried out in the two systems work together to produce sugar which can then be used immediately for energy. Photosystem II has a lot of other molecular pigments, such as chlorophyll a and molecules such as chlorophyll b, b3 and b3b, which are needed for photosynthesis. Photosystem I has much less of these molecules, but has a higher concentration of molecules such as 3-phosphoglycerate and ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate. The conversion of light into the energy produced by these two molecules is also more efficient when the light hits these chlorophyll molecules than when it is reflected from the chlorophyll molecules.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Photosystem II is the source of light, and is found in every leaf area, but most of it is located in stems. Photosystem II is also found in stems of plants like the willow, and is also found in other parts of the plant. The major difference is that photosystem II has much larger amounts of chlorophyll molecules, and therefore has more of the chlorophyll molecules needed for photosynthesis.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad The light-harvesting complex in photosystem II is thought to be composed mainly of chlorophyll A (Chl-a) molecules, which are found in leaf tissues. The other major component is bacteriochlorophyllide A, which provides the necessary chlorophyll for photosystem II. At low lighting, or on leaves of plants or their cousins, the reaction of photorespiration is carried out by photosystem I, and the final product, glucose, is made available for cell growth.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad The main product of photosystem I, glucose, which is then used for energy and growth. The main pigment molecules associated with photosystem I are molecules such as 3-deoxypsychophyllate, and molecules such as chlorophyll b, and b3b, which are needed for photosynthesis. The conversion of light into the energy produced by these two molecules is also more efficient when the light hits these chlorophyll molecules than when it is reflected from the chlorophyll molecules.\nMolecular Biochemistry of Plants (PLA, CSE-4253) Dr. Parinda Agrawal, Associate Professor, Department of Plant Biotechnology, University of Hyderabad Chlorophyll a is a major source of energy for plants and other photosynthetic organisms. The energy harvested by chlorophyll molecules is stored in bonds between carbon and hydrogen. These bonds are used in the electron transport chain to produce a chemical energy called ATP. ATP then enters into reactions known as photosynthesis I and photosynthesis II to produce the reactants needed to provide the energy that is required for photosynthetic processes. The major components of plants, which are involved in both types of reactions are: Photosystem II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) Chlorophyll a and molecules such as chlorophyll b and b3b", "num_tokens_generated": 2783, "OGF": 0.679443359375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 66.87927460670471, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 616, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Their current contract started in 1985. The firm was subsequently awarded other contracts in London.\nAs of 2017 Premier Electrics is a national operating business, maintaining an operational base in London but with the majority of its employees working on the road and resident working in Scotland.\nThey also have a specialist unit dedicated to the renovation of older homes which was set up based around an employee's long-standing experience. As of 2017 this unit specializes in the refurbishment of Victorian and Edwardian houses in London, most of which would usually be the preserve of builders.\nHistorically, Premier Electrics was a general electrician, working on the electrical installions that were present in houses prior to the regulations of the 1950s. However, with the advent of national and EU legislation as well as technological advances, the business has increasingly moved into the fields of electrical rewiring (including electric car charger installations), electrical installations for new builds and other renovation work, and fire safety (such as automatic fire alarms, waking up systems and fire door installations). It also advises homeowners on energy efficient electricity and how to make homes eco-friendly.\nPremier Electrics has had a number of high profile contracts in the early 2000s, including a contract in 2008 to install and maintain electricity for the Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2010 they also won a contract to install and maintain electrics for the main terminal building of London City Airport. In 2012, they renewed the contract for work at the Euston estate of the London Borough of Camden. In 2013, Premier Electrics won a two-year contract to install and maintain electrics and lighting at the O2 Arena in North Greenwich in London.\nhttps://www.pioneerelectrical.com/electrical-repairs\nhttps://www.pioneerelectrical.com/electrical-maintenance", "num_tokens_generated": 1296, "OGF": 0.31640625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 29.608158111572266, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 620, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The natural gas passes through the compressor, heater and then to the end of the process without ever increasing in temperature and pressure; and without ever passing through any heat exchanger. At the end of the process, the gas is heated up to a very high temperature or the liquid is heated up in a batch (a single shot). When the temperature reaches a high enough level, the process changes from a liquid to a gas and this transition is made easier by using a pressure reduction device (a decoupler or a flash vessel). The only way to make this happen, and the only way to get these benefits, is to go to an in-line heat exchanger and use a constant flow process. The benefits are so significant that the addition of the in-line heat exchanger and pressure regulation is simply mandatory. It takes only two pieces of equipment to go to an in-line heat exchanger from a single compression process to a constant flow process with multiple compression stages and heat exchangers. These energy improvements and cost savings come from four areas \u2013 energy savings from the use of multiple stages and the elimination of waste heat; energy savings from the elimination of heater duty; the elimination of additional cost energy usage due to the lack of adequate in-line regulation; and the elimination of in-line coolers due to the need for a regulator. This is just the result of adding a constant flow process. If a single energy use is eliminated at a facility and this is a major plant, there will be significant savings in the entire operation. These savings show, the constant flow process will be used.\n1.7B TONS OF ICE TENDER OPERATIONS: IN-FLIGHT 1 CATHOOLD FLUE-SAVE 20-40% OF OPERATING COSTS SAVINGS REDUCE FLUMES, OPEN PORT AND SAVE EXCHANGERS SAVINGS ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY\nThe actual production rate when the conversion occurs is 924 MMCFD (daily) or 2,962 MCFD (typical).
