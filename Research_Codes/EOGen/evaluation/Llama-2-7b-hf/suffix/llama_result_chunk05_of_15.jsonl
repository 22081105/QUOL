One friend orders an alcoholic beverage. One friend orders two food items. The total cost is exactly divisible by five. What is the total cost for their orders? What's the quickest way to solve this problem? Method: Let's say that there is one type of each item and the number of each item and the price of each item is given. We can solve it using the greedy algorithm by considering a new state in every turn: The item is selected and removed from the list. What happens next?\nSuppose there are two items left on the list and each item has the same price. Which one to remove? If both items have the same price, do you prefer the one that is more expensive or the one that is cheaper?

[\u2026] For ODST, I am attempting to do this for the map Beaver Creek in order to create an AI pack with no visible players. The map Beaver Creek in HALO ODST is an excellent place to have an AI Pack of UNSC Soldiers. Recommended: - - The AIs follow the player, so I have created a very simple AI pack of UNSC Soldiers. - This AI pack consists of the following: - There is a small UNSC AI squad for every player in the game. The AIs are always on alert, and they immediately shoot at any UNSC grenade that is dropped by the player. - The AIs follow the player, but they will always attack him. The AIs will be very aggressive when they see a UNSC grenade dropped by the player and they will shoot at him. - The AIs will always attack the player, but they will only attack him when there is an UNSC grenade dropped by the player. The AIs will also shoot at any enemy that is in the vicinity of the player. -The AIs follow the player, but they will not attack him when there is no enemy in the vicinity of him. 25 1 This AI pack consists of the following The AIs follow the player. The AIs follow the player, but they will will always attack him. The AIs will always attack him. The AIs will act The AIs will always attack the player. The AIs will always attack the player. The AI will always attack him. - This AI pack consists of the following: - There is a small UNSC AI squad for every player in the game. The squad consists of: - UNSC Soldier, UNSC Marines, and UNSC Marines: Each squad is assigned to different areas. The squads are controlled by different people, and their assignment will change depending on the situation. - UNSC Marine, UNSC Infantry, and UNSC Marine: Each of these squads are assigned to different areas, and their assignment will change depending on how far the player is from them. - UNSC Infiltrator, UNSC Elite Grenadier, and UNSC Infiltrator Elite: Each of these squads is assigned to different areas. The squads are controlled by different people, and their assignment will change depending on their respective position in the game. - UNSC Infiltrator Elite: Each of these squads is assigned to different areas. The squads are controlled by different people, and their assignment will change depending on their respective position in the game. - UNSC Heavy, UNSC Warthog, and UNSC Warthog: Each of these squads is assigned to different areas. The squads are controlled by different people, and their assignment will change depending on how far the player is from them. For these squads, I created a custom model with a custom armor to make it easy for me to control the AIs and their placement. The custom model can be easily downloaded from this link: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZHXdQd6Zz4[/url] For the rest of this AI pack, I decided to leave out the other units and create a custom AI pack for them. For this reason, I added an extra AI unit in this pack. This AI unit is named AI Soldier. This AI unit can also have their assignment, but this will depend on the situation. For the rest of the custom AI unit, I decided to leave\nNavy Chief Petty Officer. This is the highest enlisted rank in the Navy. You'll wear a blue-red-green striped coat and you'll be the one to give orders and get others to do their jobs. If you want a chance to be a Chief Petty Officer, you'll need to put together and wear your uniform correctly. This is the most difficult grade in the Navy, so it is important that you know how to wear your uniform correctly. You'll be required to wear the Chief Petty Officer uniform in order to qualify for military training, and other military-related classes. If you miss that, you've got to get yourself to a recruiting station.\nhttp://feelingshy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Odstar_Full_Product_Key_Free_Download.pdf\nhttps://p2p-tv.com/en/profile/sherlonvittolle/profile\nhttps://www.wit.pw/profile/GraveHackHack-Free-MacWin/profile\nhttps://www.frankandkyle.com/profile/zackelcara/profile", "num_tokens_generated": 1084, "OGF": 0.2646484375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 24.691325426101685, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 343, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Please make sure to add your python language code as well as what you have tried and what is the issue you're facing. This makes for a better question and increases the chances of getting more helpful answers. Take a look at our [ask page](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) and [How to Ask a Good Question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) as well as the [help center](https://stackoverflow.com/help). Thanks for understanding.\n\nAnswer: In terms of \"violence\" - no, you can simply use a string replace like above.  You just need to find the regex pattern, then the text to substitute and then a regex.  Regex are pretty powerful, but you need to learn them.\n\nIf you google regular expressions (or regex) you will find a lot of information that will point you in the right direction.  This is not a place to point to that type of material as it would violate the Stack Overflow terms of service; but it is something you can go look for yourself.\n\nOn to the actual problem.\n\nThe problem is not the file format - it is the way that the table is formatted for HTML.  You really don't need a program to help you read the file.  All you need is to simply know the format and then to use a regular expression to extract the value; and then you have to do it in a way where that the data makes sense to the program you are using.\n\nIf you have the data in text format, you can read it into a list of strings and then simply replace the substring  that contains the HTML tag and value with a string that contains the value.  That is a pretty straightforward solution.\n\nPython uses a `re` module that helps you with that.  You need to install it using your OS package management tool (i.e., `apt`, `npm`, `python`, etc.) so that if you can download it (it is on GitHub).

You have the `-O3` flag with `-fprofile-instr-Generate` and `-fprofile-force`. These can actually be used with any C++ compiler, but they are only really useful with gcc.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n`-O3` - Enable all optimization and run-time code size features\n\n`-fprofile-instr-generate` (GCC)\n\n`-fprofile-instrument` (TDM-GCC)\n\nCreate assembly profiles for CPU and other ISA's. If a profile is\nvalid and `-fprofile-generate` is passed the compiler will generate\nall of the asm code to measure execution time; if `-fprofile-generate` isn't passed a dummy header with `extern __attribute__((always_inline)) unsigned long __profile_func(void);` function is added. The\nresulting asm code can be parsed by the C profile code to perform\noptimizations.\n\n`-fprofile-force` or\n`-finstrument-full`\n\nIf you are using the `fprofile` flags (see below) and want to create\nprofile symbols in C++ code, pass this to force the asm code to be\ngenerated for the entire code. In some cases, if you only pass `-fprofile-generate`, code may be generated and if your program\nis large enough it might not fit in memory or be generated in\ncompletion time. If an abort occurs, an assertion may be violated or\nthe executable size may be reached. `-finstrument-full` is a synonym\nfor `-fprofile-force` in a non-GCC compiler. It is normally not worth changing\n\n`-fprofile-generate` (GCC)\n\n`-fprofile-instrument` (TDM-GCC)\n\nInforms the compiler to generate the asm code to produce profile\nstatistics for execution time. This is currently only supported on GCC\nand TDM-GCC with the C++ compiler.\n\n`-finstrument-functions` (TDM-GCC)\n\nIf this is being compiled with C++ and there are only C++ symbols,\nand you have `-fprofile-generate` and `-fprofile-force` set,\n`-finstrument-functions` instructs the compiler to generate asm code\nfor C++ symbol functions. It is useful for enabling optimizations in\nC++ code. This requires more work to create the asm code but allows\noptimalization while creating a profile for C code.\n\nGCC does not currently support `-finstrument-functions` so the C++\ncompiler is silently ignored for optimization (ie, `-O1` is always\nused instead of `-O3`. Also, if `-finstrument-functions` is used, the\nC++ compiler is silently ignored for compilation.\n\n`-fverbose-asm`\n\nTurns on verbose, detailed assembly output. This option turns on\nverbose code generation for inliners. For many optimizing compilers\ninlining is not done when optimization is set to `-O3` or higher. The\ndetailed assembly code generation can give you good information about\noptimizations done during inlining. You can then apply this information to the assembly code to give a better idea of what the\ncompiler is doing at each location in your program. For details on the\n-verbose-asm option, see `gcc -v`.\n\n-fprofile-gnu-unique (GCC)\n\nProduces code to measure unique instructions per function. This\noption can be used in addition to any of the other profiling options.\n\n`-fprofile-regmap`\n\nProduces code to map variable addresses to register numbers during\nexecution and produce more accurate function profiles. This option\nrequires additional compile time and may produce some code size\nincrease so only use it if you need to improve profile accuracy. For\nmore info see `gcc -v`.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSee `-fprofile-instr-generate`: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-8.2.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#index-fprofile-instr-generate\n\nIt is unprecedented that `clang++` is so limited on Linux. It is\nextremely useful when working on Linux. However, for an optimized\ncompilation and when you know what you are doing, you will be able to\nset `-fno-profile-arcs` to make the compilation take a tiny bit more\ntime. You will be able to get rid of a compiler-based profile\ninstrumentation step by passing `-fprofile-arcs` along with\n`-fprofile-instrumented-instr-inlining` and `-fno-profile-arcs`.\n\nIn the source code, it is pretty much a black box process. For\nexample, [the Clang compiler has a profile arcs implementation](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Epes20/profiles/Arcs/Clang/), however,\nit is a proprietary work, and it is used for the proprietary binary\nform, [LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LTO.html).\n\nThe `-fprofile-arcs` is part of Clang Optimizing Code Generation that\nprovides the implementation of the following compiler optimizations:\n\n\\em{-fprofile-arcs creates an array of counters of the total number of arithmetic instructions performed in\na function. -finstrumented-instr-inlining then counts the number of\nfunction invocations and the number of times function arguments\nare passed in registers. This information is used with arcs to\npredict the amount of arcs that will be created through inlining}.\n\nWhen you call the Clang compiler with `-fprofile-arcs`, it creates arcs. If `-fprofile-instr-generate` is\npassed, it adds counters. Here are a few snippets of the Linux\nClang profiling implementation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{libclang} - C++ / LLVMLibrary.so - \\strong{Function profile arcs}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn the Clang source code, here is a snippet of the \\strong{\\em{'profile'}} function\n\n\\begin{code}\n// If we have a profile type available, get the value from it.\n// Don't do this for debug information.\nif (TData->ProfileType.get() <= PTDI_COUNTEDINSTR ||\n    TData->ProfileType.get() <= PTDI_PROFILEARCS) {\n    count = getNumCumulativeInstrCount(TData->ProfileData);\n  if (count == 0)\n    return 0;\n  return count;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n`getNumCumulativeInstrCount()` returns a scalar count of instructions as an `int/size_t`.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{libclang} - C++ \\em{../CodeGen/RuntimeLib.cpp} - \\strong{Cumulative Function Counting}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn the Clang source code,\n\n\\begin{code}\n  if (functionId != 0) {\n    // Try to find the cumulative function count for this function.\n    unsigned Function;\n    bool Found = false;\n    unsigned NumCalls = 0;\n    unsigned NumArgs = 0;\n    do {\n      Found = RecordedFunctionIds.count(functionId);\n      if (Found) {\n        auto it = RecordedFunctionIds.lookup(functionId);\n        NumCalls = static_cast<unsigned>(it->size());\n        if (NumCalls == 0)\n          return 0;\n      }\n      functionId = GetNextFunctionId();\n    } while (functionId != 0);\n\n    if (functionId != 0) {\n      if (RecordedFunctions.count(functionId) > 0)\n        NumArgs += RecordedFunctions.lookup(functionId)->Arity;\n      RecordedFunctions.insert(pair<unsigned, ProfiledFunction>(functionId,\n                                                Profile(NumCalls, NumArgs)));\n    }\n\n    if (functionId == 0) {\n      NumCalls = 1;\n      RecordedFunctions.insert(\n        pair<unsigned, ProfiledFunction>(ProfiledCounts.size(),\n          Profile(NumCalls, NumArgs)));\n      ProfiledCounts.push_back(NULL);\n    }\n  }\n  return NumCalls;\n\\end{code}\n\nThe \\strong{`clang++` source code}, it seems, is very limited for\n`optimal` compilation on Linux. So, I would recommend using\n[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/documentation.html). It is pretty easy to\nuse, and it is optimized for Linux. Some of my previous codes, when\ntransplanted onto `GCC`, can make the `x86`-based binary form even\nfaster than the `AVX`-based binary form. So, I can imagine the\n`GCC`-based code to be even faster than the `AVX`-based code using\n`-O3` for the `GCC`-based code.\n\nAs for what `clang++` is optimized for, it might not be suitable for\ncompiled code that is for the `GCC` compiler on Linux but is for\n`Clang` on OS X. So, it is probably for the optimizing of the compiled\ncode for the `Clang` compiler on OS X.\n\nThere are plenty of optimizing options under `-O3` for `GCC`, such as\n`-O3 -mtune=native -march=native -funroll-only`.\n\n`-O3 -mtune=native -march=native -funroll-only` is probably not useful\nfor `clang++`. It is probably more useful for `GNU GCC`, but the\n`clang++` cannot be used under `-fprofile-arc`. If it can be used\nunder `-fprofile-arc`, the code seems fine to use.\n\nComment: Great answer! It explains why on my system (Mac Book) the result doesn't vary whether I compiled with: `-O3\n--target-cpu=native\n-fno-profiling-arcs`, or without `-fno-profiling-arcs`. In addition, it gives the details for the Linux side of Clang, and tells me where to look for implementation details.  Thanks a lot!\n\nComment: @NateEldredge, you are welcome.

I'm not sure of the exact mechanism, but that is guaranteed by the ISO/IEC 9899 specification and complied with in every C compiler I know.\n\nAnswer: The code is fast because the `data[c]` that are greater than 127 will appear earlier to the last part of the loop.\n\nTake a second array like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\n  for (int c = 0; c < 100; ++c)\n    data[c] = (c == 99) ? 1 : 2;\n\\end{code}\n\nIt is likely in Java it is fast because the compiler, the sort, inserts an instruction to store the value at the memory location once it is found, so as to avoid a cache miss.\n\n\\begin{code}\nint data[100];\nint j = 100;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\n{\n  for (int c = 0; c < j; ++c)\n    data[c] = (c == 99) ? 1 : 2;\n  j = j > 100 ? 100 : 2;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nI would guess that C does the same.\n\nComment: This is also what I would guess. The cache isn't supposed to operate on \"partially sorted\" arrays - it has to do that for the entire range of the array, so it has to sort the entire array. That results in a significant amount of work for the cache, but it should help to reduce misses.\n\nAnswer: I see  a few different possible mechanisms for why that might be the case:\n\nOne is that sorting might have reduced the number of instructions in the loop by making the loop invariant instead of covariant, and the covariant version might have been slower.  Sorting on an array might make that obvious by causing it to stop sooner.\n\nComment: It doesn't strike me that sorting *could* have made either case be faster, or vice versa.  Sorting has nothing to do with whether it loops for a fixed, predetermined number of iterations.\n\nComment: I am not suggesting it is a linear difference in cost.  I am suggesting that it is possible some sorting operations might be cheaper than others.\n\nComment: @Ben: If there is any caching, it might also be the case that it is optimized to use it for just a single instruction (e.g., `mov` in x86).  Of course I can't test a `mov`, but if there is a random, random access, `mov` may be optimal.\n\nComment: \"I see a few different possible mechanisms for why that might be the case\" This is all there is to it.  10s of thousands of programmers are working on microbenchmarks like this right now, trying to optimize for cache misses.  Why on earth would you think this would end with the optimizer just not doing anything to the critical data, thus making it no better than random data?\n\nComment: Why would you think this would end up with the compiler making the loop invariant?  Sorting a single element is a much smaller operation.  I wouldn't be surprised if inefficient coding was the cause of that; I'd expect this to change with some refactoring to fix the unneeded sorting.", "num_tokens_generated": 1491, "OGF": 0.364013671875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 35.93244171142578, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 350, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

There are more than 4 billion people who knows and uses Java, but no-one, except probably me (who also wrote a version in Visual Basic) use \"C#\".\n\nComment: i'm not sure what u are trying to say, \"no\" i haven't learnt c++ yet...\n\nAnswer: A first guess would be this line:\n\n\\begin{code}\n scanf(\"%2c\", buf1[0]);\n\\end{code}\n\nis supposed to assign character at address `char* buf1[0]`, but is probably attempting to read a 32 bit integer. The same applies to two other variables. They will probably all throw away 29 bits and you will most likely see the first byte they see. This could be '1', 'a' or '0'.\n\nComment: so, how do you know that all scans are for ints? Is there some default type? Or do you look in the documentation?\n\nComment: @MikeSeymour: Look at my response to comment, that `printf` can generate output of different type, also `printf` uses C-Style specifiers (as all `printf` functions with `C-Style` suffix do), that is `%d` for int, and `%s` for strings. If you want to pass string in the array, you `scan` `sprintf` (without the `scan` ). If you don't care about format specifier, you can use `scanfs` or just pass array and character to index (see also `scanfn`/`scanvf`/`scanfv` functions). Another hint is that all array `char` are by default of `signed` type.\n\nComment: Also, C isn't an 8-bit microprocessor, and if it were, it would have `bscanf(\"%2c\", (char*){b,})`, not `scanf(\"%2c\", (char){b,}).\n\nAnswer: It is probably because the addresses are not aligned. Try this\n\n\\begin{code}\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n\nint main() {\n    char buf1[][N][N]={\"100\",\"100\",\"110\",\"105\"};\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){\n        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++){\n            printf(\"%2c\", buf1[i][j]);\n        }\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: It looks like you mixed up the printf and scanf calls to read a number (which only take the size, not the type of a variable) with the ones that take a pointer to a variable (which allow you to read a \"normal\" size).\n\nMoreover, you should never use a char array in c, but the char* variable when you want characters.\n\nComment: you've missed my point.. i didn't mean that i used printf for numbers...\n\nbut i can't find out what is wrong with my scanf's though...", "num_tokens_generated": 1591, "OGF": 0.388427734375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 36.98025631904602, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 355, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The Democrats have 14 senators and 14 lower house representatives in office now but want to triple those numbers in the March election. They will be in a position to do so if they win three state senate seats in Victoria plus seven lower house seats in ACT and SA. The party is spending as much as $1.5 million dollars on election ads and is running a get-out-the-vote campaign which, according to one newspaper in SA, has cost as much as $200,000 in printing and postage. MONEY IN THE BANK: The money raised will, the Democrats say, be put towards further political campaigns against the \"vested interests\" of the political parties. But no one should be under any illusions. The Democrats are a small party and they have to spend a lot more money than is currently being suggested to make a political impact \u2014 the main reason for it seeking public funding in the first place. The 1998 election costs were $2.48 million for the Democrats' election campaign \u2014 which delivered 12 seats in Senate. That figure went up to over $41 for the most recent election, when the Democrats got no more seats \u2014 which now costs 2.2 per cent of its annual income of $2.2 million dollars in public funding. The Democrats, like all other political parties, can only afford to put money into their election campaigns if they can raise it from donors \u2014 just as the major parties do. DONATIONS: THE Democrats' annual report which was released earlier this month, and which was published by News Limited, shows that the donations from the 2012-13 financial year totalled $732,759.61 in cash and $122,832.80 in property. They also got some help from a fund set up by the late Senator Peggy Dwyer (in which she held $603,012.94 and which is now up for grabs under her will). That was paid back from their cash reserves. They also got various grants \u2014 mostly from the federal government. The combined total went in the Democrats bank account at the end of last year of $970,895.99. MONEY TAKE-UP: Now the Democrats have to put the cash to work. THE Democrats say they don't want to receive the public funding as it is \"unfair\". But, in fact, their position seems to be rather the opposite: they are willing to take what they can get. It is interesting how the Democrats can be so keen to spend more heavily upon their election operations and so willing to spend more cash to buy them. If the party wants to expand its membership base and influence by \"selling itself short\" \u2014 as it does in its election campaign \u2014 then let it get out there and raise money. WORD ON THE STREET: I have said this many times before but it bears repeating every now and then: the truth is that few people in Australia are prepared to donate substantial sums of their money to any political party or individual \u2014 save during election campaigns \u2014 because they feel a political party is going to use such money to fund personal political ambitions. THE Democrats' position on public funding is hardly in keeping with current political debate in this country. But while it is fair to say this is the case (and it would be equally fair to ask the Democrats to change their position), it is NOT fair to say that the amount of money the Democrats claim to be denied is actually being denied to their election operations. THE Democrats were, until recently, one of the richest political parties in Australia \u2014 at least in terms of funding by the federal government. But over the past few years it has fallen back. In the election just before the carbon tax was introduced (2010) it received $3.5 million dollars in federal funding. For the election the carbon tax was repealed and the Senate reinstated (2013), it got $1.9 million dollars. And then before the last budget hit (2013-14) it got just $1.35 million dollars \u2014 the lowest ever for a party of its size. The real issue with the Democrats' claim is that the total number of seats the party could be awarded \u2014 in future by the Senate and the House of Representatives \u2014 would be reduced by about 50 per cent. That, alone, is a very important issue which raises questions about how the government might proceed. If, as a matter of principle, it refuses to fund the Democrats, that means they would not be able to elect members to the federal government. And if they cannot elect members of the federal government, what is the point of them winning seats in the Victorian Senate again? Is the only purpose to be a force in some sort of anti-Government pressure group? WITHOUT MONEY: If the Democrats are serious about being a major political party in Australia \u2014 in electing members of both houses the federal Parliament, including senators \u2014 they are being very short sighted in their demand for public funding. If, on the other hand, you want to keep a party running purely on a shoestring, then you keep the money flow coming into the banks and make sure it doesn't go into the wallets of members and supporters. And then, again, what is the Democratic party going to do if the funds are not available from the federal government? It doesn't change the fact that it seems to know how to spend money to election purposes \u2014 at least when it involves \"buying up\" the votes of public servants in the Senate and local councillors and mayors and the like in the House of Representatives. It's what it does \u2014 and does well. And that is the fundamental problem the Democrats are facing in their current crisis. If the party wants to be in the position in which it can win the support of the public, then it will have to come up with more funds than it currently has or could ever hope to get. If the new public funding system is implemented that would, of course, mean the Democrats are losing not only much of their current cash reserves, they also lose the large amounts they will be getting over the next four years \u2014 the amount of which has more than doubled \u2014 which, to the benefit of them and to its detriment, the government is now giving away for free. But, of course, that was the government's political choice when it decided to take public money away from the Democrats.\n/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/dPnd3JwjTmseLbXvPkhRG/90747cf7-364f-4b25-801e-e206a7721ef2.jpg/r2_0_4999_2832_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\nDemocrats claim money shortage after $1.35m funding cut\nTHE Australian Democrats are in the dark about where they are going to get the money to run their federal election campaign next year \u2014 and their future political activities.\nIn the latest twist to the political battle between the Democrats and the government over last month's election funding cut by the Abbott Government, the Democrats made a \"representative\" claim of about $1.5 million dollars worth of damages \u2014 as a result of the government's decision to stop funding the current parliamentary elections in 2014.\nDEMOCRATS ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL: (l to r) Ms Helen Haines, Ms Zoe Daniels, Senator Lee Rhiannon, Ms Lyn Allison and Senator Andrew Bartlett. Picture: Stuart Rutherford\nLast Friday the Abbott Government released its proposed changes to the federal funding legislation -- which will end public money going to political parties like the Democrats for their election campaigns in the 2013-14 federal election.\nThe decision was announced by the Minister for the Interior, Senator Eric Abetz, in Canberra and the Democrats immediately jumped into the attack with a claim the government \"would be the only major party to be funding its campaign\".\nDEMOCRATS HQ: The Democratic Party base of office in Canberra where the election funding battle is being fought over. Picture: Stuart Rutherford\nA statement from the Democrats' national campaign manager Zoe Daniels accused the government of having \"one rule for them and another for the major parties\".\nThis, she said, was \"part of the Abbott Government's undemocratic pattern of behaviour and we call on Liberal MPS [sic] to stand up to their own government.\"\nThe Democrats said the government had cut funds for the election campaign because \"the party has a different philosophy to the major parties on several issues\". These included climate change, the future of the Senate, mining royalties, and political funding.\nGRAVEDIGGER: The Federal government has announced it won't hand over any funds for election campaigns next year - a move which the Democrats are saying amounts to a campaign of political persecution.\nThe party said the cut was \"especially surprising\" when it was announced on 21 May only days before the current sitting of parliament was scheduled to end.\nSuch a move meant the Democrats would be \"disadvantaged in the run-up to the 2014 federal election\".\nMr Daniels said he expected the Democrats' cash reserves to be \"eroded to a minimum\" by the time the next election campaign was launched.\nThe party's 2012-13 audited financial report, released last week, showed its cash reserves of $1.07 million dollars had fallen from $2.46 million dollars for the previous year.\nThe Democrats said they now expected their election funding will be \"well below the $1.9 million dollars funding last year, which enabled us to win five Senate and eight state Upper House seats and win back our federal party\".\nThey said they expected the new lower funding level to see them having to \"drastically reduce or end our voter-registration drives, and reduce the number of candidates who can stand in the election.\"\nThe Democrats said the new funding level was \"unfair\", given that it was a \"third of what had been put forward to the Coalition government in 2010 and a 60 per cent cut in comparison with our most recent levels of funding\". These were $3.5 million in 2010 and $1.9 million dollars for last year.\n\"We stand for democratic funding of our political elections by public funding,\" Mr Daniels said.\"It is not fair to allow the major parties to have their funding boosted by the government, but to cut a party which has campaigned in good faith in this parliament on equal funding.\"\nDemocratic senator Lee Rhiannon said: \"[The Abbott Government is] persecuting us. They have one set of rules for the big parties and a different set of rules for us.\n\"They're also failing to fund a party that is a major force in Australian politics, in the Senate and the Lower House.\n\"Through its public funding we were able to elect seven senators, 41 lower House MPs in New South Wales, eight in Queensland, two in Victoria, and one in Western Australia. That's a huge success story,\" Senator Rhiannon said.\nHowever, she said the Abbott Government was \"using us as a political football with which to attack the Greens\".\n\"The federal public funding of parties is about fairness. The Abbott Government appears to have no interest in democratic funding principles, instead it is prepared to use its own funding rules to further its political agenda.\"\nSenator Rhiannon said the Abbott Government would \"not even extend the same funding to the party that was the biggest advocate of his own election\".\nThere were \"massive issues that they campaigned on. We are the biggest party in the Senate - we are in the House of Representatives. Why wouldn't they [the Liberals] stand up for us and fight so we can continue to have the funding we need and win back our federal party,\" she said.\nMULTI-MILLION DOLLARS: The Democrats say that what's being given to one party at election time should be given to everybody.\n\"The Liberals should stand up for principles. They have a huge chance to do that.\n\"They made claims about a fairer way to fund elections when they were in opposition.\n\"One of the biggest issues they raised time and time again was public funding. They did this at State level. Now, as soon as they have power, they are prepared to ignore them.\"\nBut while the Abbott Government was refusing to fund the Democrats' election campaigns, the federal government is still funding their political operations with $984,538 in taxpayers' money so far this year alone, the Democrats said.\nMs Daniels said \"even if [we were] to withdraw from the scheme altogether, our cash reserves would still be greater than all parties combined in 2010-11\".\n\"Therefore, we would no longer be 'publicly funded'.\"\nThe Democrats said the only way their election campaigns \"could receive further public funding from the federal government is if they [the Libs] repeal the Public Funding and Disclosure Reform Act 2011 and replace it, as a priority, with our 2010-11 Fair Political Donations proposal\".\nFAIR DONATIONS: The Liberal Democrats say their proposals are for fair funding by government to ensure all parties - big and small - get public money at election time.\n\"The major parties must stop receiving taxpayers' money and be financially independent,\" Mr Daniels said.\nHe blamed the Liberal and Labor parties for the new electoral funding situation since \"the major parties supported a scheme in which the taxpayers are forced to provide funds to the major parties\".\nMr Daniels said: \"Both major parties have been calling for fairer political funding for a long time and now they get to test out their own rhetoric.\"\nHe said the Democrats now expected to be in \"dire straits\" at the next federal election unless there are changes to the legislation.\nAccording to the Democrats, \"It is expected that most other parties will also be negatively impacted by the Coalition government with many likely to lose access to funding all together\".\nThe Democrats said Senator Rhiannon had already proposed changes to the legislation \"to prevent the government's actions from undemocratically denying Australian voters a choice from the Australian Democrats and all the minor parties that are not funded by the major parties\".\nMr Daniels said the Democrats \"will now be reviewing the various party registration laws ... to assess the best steps forward\".\n\"But it is clear that the Abbott Government will have breached its own fair funding promises made in the election campaign; and the Democrats will seek damages for breaches of contract of up to several million dollars,\" he said.\n\"Australians overwhelmingly voted for a political system that included all Australian parties, not the major two.\"\nThe government announced that it would end public funding of political parties because \"this funding is unnecessary and is too open to abuse\".\n\"It is time we look after hard-working Australians, not self-interested politicians and their cronies,\" the Minister for the Interior, Senator Eric Abetz, said.\n\"The decision by my government to withdraw political donation funding from this Labor government is based on 10 years of Labor Party corruption, ranging from the 'cash for comment' scandal to overpayment of travel expenses of MPs and Senators. This corruption comes on top of repeated attempts by this government to introduce draconian and counter-productive campaign spending limits.\"\nSenator Abetz said the former Labor Government had repeatedly broken its spending limits and overpaid MPs and Senators to the tune of more than $103 million taxpayer dollars. The average payout was nearly $42,000 to individual MPs.\n\"Such abuse of taxpayers' money is one of the fundamental reasons why the Liberal National Party will not be accepting taxpayer funding beyond the current term.\"\nThe Democrats said their claim was brought against the Federal government via Senator Rhiannon and supported by \"all Federal Democrat parliamentarians and candidates ... in their official capacity as representatives of the Australian Democratic Party, a political party recognised by the Commonwealth as eligible under Commonwealth legislation to receive funding\".\nAustralian Democrats claiming $1.5 million in lost election funds\nTHE Australian Democrats are in the dark about where they are going to get the money to run their federal election campaign next year - and their future political activities.\nIn the latest twist to the political battle between the Democrats and the government over last month's election funding cut by the Abbott Government, the Democrats made a \"representative\" claim of about $1.5 million dollars worth of damages - as a result of the government's decision to stop funding the current parliamentary elections in 2014.\nThe decision was announced by the Minister for the Interior, Senator Eric Abetz, in Canberra on Thursday and the Democrats immediately jumped into the attack with a claim the government \"would be the only major party to be funding its campaign\".\nThis was \"part of the Abbott Government's undemocratic pattern of behaviour and we call on Liberal Members [sic] to stand up to their own government,\" said a statement from the Democrats' national campaign manager Zoe Daniels.\nThe Democrats said the cut was \"especially surprising\" when it was announced on 21 May only days before the current sitting of parliament was scheduled to end.\nThis move meant the Democrats would be \"disadvantaged in the run-up to the 2014 Federal election\".

It must have a header file (ex: List.hpp) which is the class definition for a linked list class. In your header file, give the class a destructor (class destructors aren't implemented in C++ until modern versions of it). Create your class (ex: \"class Foo\"), but don't do anything inside of it just yet (other than defining that class). The assignment should be your assignment class. You should be able to create objects of the class, and those objects should be able to destroy their linked list. In your implementation file (ex: \"List.cpp\") You should be able to write your constructor, destructor, and class methods (class only method are \"friend methods\" -- they are \"friend\" to the class) I know you want to do this in code rather than doing it in the IDE, but I want to know if this is the result of a \"Hello World\".

It is very difficult to be able to test your code in a way that can be used in production applications. You can create a C++ code tester class to make sure that your code will function in the environment you are using. In this blog post I will show you how to make a simple code tester that will not only verify the code, but will also tell you if any errors are found. This class can run against any class you have written, but it doesn't have any built-in functionality. It just provides a simple interface that checks the code and does not try to understand your code. It can also be used to test other parts of your code too. The class should be designed like this: The first thing you notice is that this class is in a class library. This means that I can reuse the code for more than one class in the library. So I will use the C++ class library. class TestCppClass { public: void run() { return true; } void run() = 0; }; This class has only one member function called run() and it is designed to test for errors. Once I run this test on my code, the class will print out all the errors it detects. This means that I can easily detect errors that I don't want to see. In C++ code this class is defined as follows: This is how the class is defined in the code tester interface. class TestCppObject { public: void run() { return 0; }; }; The tester interface is defined as: The tester class can test code and not code that is not meant to be tested. This is a useful feature because you don%[email protected]'t have to make the code tester class yourself and you can just write your own. So first I need the tester class, so I can write the tester interface. I also need my class to run the tester. So I have two different classes that I need to create the tester. And the first one is the code tester class. And this is the class that I will use later in the blog post. The class is called class CodeTester { public: class CodeTester::Run() { if (codeTester.run() == true) { return codeTester; } else { return false; } codeTester = new CodeTester(); // codeTester has to run. codeTester->run(); cout << \"Passed\\r\\n\"; return true; } void StartTest() { // start the code tester and start the code tester here. codeTester.run(); } void CloseTest() { // end the coding tester here. codeTester->run(); } codeTester->run( ); // call the code code tester.\nTesting a C Program\nC programming is a very tough subject if not done properly. This is the reason why we have to test our code. In this post I will explain you how to test your C programs. It is not as difficult as you might think. In this article, we will talk about what we call \"unit testing\" and what it means to you. This is an exercise for you. To go further, we will test this code below. This is one of the most common ways of testing C Programs This is by using static method of the class to test the object. This is the first of the five main test method types. This is static method. You can use this method to test any class as well as the class itself. The other types are static method and the other static method. What is the difference between static method and the other static method types. The difference is in the type. The other static methods are the other static method. The static methods are not static methods for the class but rather the class. I think we need to get back to the class now. In this case, we would create a class called Class1. This will help us test this class object. We have to do a little bit more work, but we will have to get back soon. And then, we have to write a little bit more code to do this. And then it will be a little bit more than that. Then, we have to write some code to test this object. This is the last step of this article, the class object. We have just created the object. So, in this part, we will create a object in this class. And then we will test it. After the test, we can do some more code.", "num_tokens_generated": 1253, "OGF": 0.305908203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 29.24473524093628, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 359, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The definition of a turbulent wake is a region where the aerodynamic force components generated by a body are larger than the viscous forces generated by the boundary layer. TURBULENCE TRAINING 02 - TURBULENCE IN LENGTHENED WINGS AND IN CURVED-FLAP WINGS. The turbulent wake of a NACA0012 airfoil is a region roughly 2 chord- lengths ahead of an airfoil separated from the airfoil by a flat-plate. When a flat-plate is added in tow of the leading edge on both of the airfoils the wakes develop into flat-plate wakes. Wake from a 12x12 airfoil TURBULENCE TRAINING 03 - TURBULENCE IN AEROFOILS WITH NO STAIRCASE. The flat-plate wakes, sometimes known as straight tail wakes, will be used here for illustration purposes. (a) The flat-plate wake is the normal distribution of turbulence for an isolated airfoil wake as shown by the red curve. Above and below the wake, the turbulence velocity varies slowly compared to the maximum velocity. Because the turbulence velocity is close to the minimum velocity in the boundary layer, the flat-plate wakes may not be suitable for turbulent boundary layer flow at the wing leading edge. The flat-plate wakes, however, are suitable for calculating wake interactions among many isolated airfoils. (b) If a flat-plate wake is moved away from the trailing edge but close to the leeward trailing-edge wake then the turbulence distribution will change. The normal distribution spreads upstream and becomes broader and taller. An asymmetric wake is formed and is shown by the blue curve. TURBULENCE TRAINING 04 - TURBULENCE IN AEROFOILS WITH STRAITCASE. An airfoil has a staircase cross-section and an upward convex (curved-flap) cross-section. An airfoil with the above cross-section and other parameters that produce the given effect will be called a \u201cstaircase-flap-curved- airfoil\u201d.

It is the purpose to take the water out of the soil on the surface to the lowest level. There are different shapes and sizes of tile. The tile used in this section is 8 by 6 inches and is laid by teams with machines. They lay a certain number of feet of tile in line. These are cut into 8-foot lengths, 1/4 of a 4-inch tile. A hole 2-1/2 x 8-inch tile is laid in the center of the hole, the other two sides of the hole are laid the same distance from the side of the tile, these are laid the length of the hole, then the ends of the trench are laid the same length as the top of the hole. These tiles are laid at about 2.5 foot centers in width. The next step after the tile is laid in the trench, the hole for tile in the center is filled in around the tile with 3-inch stone to set the tile firmly with the stones, then the other stones used for setting the tile are then laid in the trench. Two of these stones are laid each side across the top of the tile, and all sides about the length of 2 or 3 tile, are covered with 1/2 inch stone to keep from cracking the bottom of the trench. This is a drain tile that is laid. After the stone is laid around the tile, the stone is tamped by a rammer tamped until there is no air between the stone and the dirt, and a hole is made each side of dirt is put in to the bottom, and a board is used to lay 1/3 way across the holes, to prevent dirt from coming out, leaving the bottom open. Then, with a shovel, dirt is thrown in until water does not run out. When a job of 100 or 200 feet of tiling is done, every other hole is tested with a piece of board, and when the dirt is heavy enough, the tiles can be tested with a water level. This is when the dirt is put over the tile by the same amount all over the field and all around the hole. The tile is used in the holes in the field. The tile is used to let the water drain through the hole and into the bottom of the field so that no standing water will collect in the bottom of the field. It is the purpose to make a drainage ditch around the whole field to take the water under the surface of the ground. The same method is used both around gardens to take water off and the cesspool or drain for the septic tank to carry off the septic tank and sewage and carry off the solid wastes into the field and not on the surface of the ground as from the water closets. These are installed after the houses are put up, when the houses are put up they are in concrete and put in the form. The ditch is installed in these. An ordinary septic tank is built for both sewage and also for storm and flood waters. This is installed in the tank. There is no need for a drainage ditch as these give the soil drainage and the water is carried off to the field by the pipes to the septic tank or cesspool. There is no standing water anywhere after this work is done. The ditch is for the sewage and drainage work. The septic tank work is a little different as there is drain pipe laid in the house sewer, there are a number of joints and a number of clean-outs where it is necessary to clean the lines. The ditch is laid, then all is put in and all is filled. When cleaning this work up there is always water on the bottom. There is more soil on the field after the work than there was before. If more tile is used than the soil will let the water pass through it quickly. It is better to put in more stone on the bottom and put a larger hole in the field ditch to take the water, using stone about three times the diameter on the bottom as you use on the surface. The stone is laid in the trench then the stone to set the tile and to use on the bottom is tamped in place with a rammer. This is drainage work on farms. (signed) A. S. Bane. In this Issue.

Many new men have been taken on and other men have been moved to larger projects because they were of better quality and knew how to handle machinery and how to work with animals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that the minimum rate for farmhands will be increased. There should also be an increase in the minimum rate of wages for the construction industry and for the production and public utility industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that the wage rate for laborers and helpers in construction shall be raised to 72 cents per hour effective September 18, at which rate the minimum wage paid in the construction industry shall be not less than $9 per day. The wage rate of 80 cents per hour is being proposed for laborers and helpers engaged in the production and public utility industries, and a 90-cent minimum wage for such workers should be instituted. The farmhandee is working long hours for less pay than his laborer on the city project. If prices and wages are going up, and taxation is rising, then all prices and wages must go up proportionately. Farming in the past, and in the future needs a strong united effort to raise the standard of all things. The prices can't come up all at once, it will take two or three years to bring the prices up to the proper point. We all want to see the price-wage-price cycle break out, so that the cost for a home can be reduced. Prices Wage and Price Controls. The control of prices, the control of credit, and the control of monetary policy are only three phases of control which are undertaken by the new government. \"Too many people still want a government to provide bread and meat and milk when they should be feeding the soul of the people. When people find out that we have a government that cannot run the government efficiently they will be demanding something even more drastic. People are not willing to wait for anything and they want immediate results. Prices do not work in such a manner as to make everybody satisfied. When a man takes over a job which has been handled for 35 years he is not going to be satisfied with a 10 per cent increase of work. He takes over that big a position and he feels that he should be paid as much as he was paid for doing it before. To him 10 per cent is a very little increase. Now, he is making the same salary that he did in the past, and is expected by everyone to do much more work. He is forced to overwork, and so do most of them, and if he overworks as much as he should this government may run into a mess of trouble. And if the government does not run into a mess of trouble the workers are. These men must give out some of the best work they are capable of giving because if they work hard and do not, it will be hard to give them anything better next year. The government is not yet willing to take over as much of the industry so that prices can be controlled. The people who raise the wheat and corn are not interested in controlling prices because all they want is a chance to get more money for their product. If the prices had been controlled in the beginning, no doubt there would be a large number of mills, bakeries, and factories which would have had a hard time making out a decent profit. The bakers and the mills are the people who need prices controlled, but farmers and cotton raisers are the ones who would have to come in for a definite amount of money for a definite quantity of goods. They wouldn't mind the controlling of prices in the beginning. But if this is continued for too long there is bound to be trouble. This is the government which is trying its best to keep prices down to a reasonable standard, and although the people are getting angry because of the high price of gasoline they are also satisfied that the gasoline will go down to a reasonable level. The price of automobiles are going to go down in the next two or three months, because the new government is more efficient than the old government. And people don't like to see a government which is no good because it causes the people to get angry. This can do nothing for the people of America, but if it can control prices and get a fair deal for the producers of America, it will be a big step in the right direction. And if this government can show its people that it is working, then they will have to see it in a different light. All we can do is wait for the inevitable to happen to the best of our ability. Prices are something that we have grown to despise for lack of a better word, and they are going to be controlled to such an extent that they will be controlled. People cannot live without bread and meat and milk. People cannot live without sugar and butter and vegetables and fruits and such things as these. People will always want these for these are the necessities. Price-wage-price cycle: The problem of a fair price is a problem which is going to be solved in the next two or three years. Credit and loans will be made available to a man that can handle a loan. But the loans are not going to be given to a man that cannot handle it. And so we are getting back to a place where the people can get credit. The government has not yet gone into the financial field, but it has the men with brains to put credit in this country where it belongs. The government has said that it is not going to issue notes to buy a car, because it will be a lot of money that the government will be spending, but it has said that it is going to issue these notes to build homes and the best jobs to do this are in the building trades. The bank which was started by Henry Ford and a number of other prominent people, and which had a lot of power in it, is now going to be broken up and a very small number of banks will be authorized to begin business. People are getting tired of getting nothing out of the bank for their money is stagnant in their savings account. They want to get something back; they want to get a return on their investments in the banks. But it is very hard for the little country banks to pay a return for the people that leave their money idle in the bank. It is easier for one bank to pay a good rate of interest on savings because the cost of operation is less. But if all the banks had to pay the same interest rates, it would bankrupt a lot of small banks. So, the government has said that it shall pay money on savings accounts. And it wants all the banks to pay the same rate of interest. Now, if the government would let people know that it did have money stagnant in the bank, the people would say that the government didn't have the business there so why not let the private banks do it? That's what we are getting at, and it looks as though it can be worked out at the next election. The government has taken away a man's right to make mistakes with his bank account, and if it didn't take away the man's right to make mistakes, all the banks would close tomorrow. The government has been able to see through the clouds of speculation, and is working on a plan which will make it very easy for the people to know that their money is safe, and yet make it very hard for anybody to take it away from them. The government, through the control of prices, has been keeping the people at the same standard for a long period of time until it began to believe in a little bit of control. The government is going to say that prices are going to be controlled whether they like it or not, because it knows that a great many people can't make out the cost of living on some of the goods that they buy. This is why the government set up a price control bureau which is working on the whole economy of this country from the point of view of the producers of the country, because it is these people who will be hurt most. Prices of gasoline and oil. It was not long ago that all prices went down a little, but now gasoline has risen $10 from the lowest price it has been in this country for the past three or four years. And it started climbing during the latter part of October. Now, it will be in the $2.35 and $2.40 range, and it will keep going up because the production of oil has decreased. This has caused prices to rise. If production keeps decreasing and prices continue to increase it will force the people to buy the motor gasoline used in the automobiles for other uses than they purchased it for in the past. Prices will go to such an extent where producers will be forced to start producing automobiles which get a lot more miles to the gallon than do their present automobiles. Prices as a whole Prices have been at a high level for a long time, but it would be good now to have them drop somewhat to give the people some relief before the next election. This will make them happier. The government has given us a 25 per cent raise, but if prices stay as high as they are now, then those people who get that raise will be paying for a 25 per cent increase in the cost of living and it will not be very nice. The question will also need to be answered of what use is all the money that is coming into the country? The government is doing great things with this money, but this money should be used for other purposes, like the building of roads and the making of airplanes and the paying of soldiers and sailors and marines and all the other things that the government does with our money. The government is going to use the people's money to the best of its ability with, the most important thing being that this people shall spend as much money as it can. And when people do not buy because the price is too high, it hurts the country in a lot of ways. But if the people keep spending money, no matter the price, then the country will be all right. And when the economy of the country is working with all its parts, then the people of this country will have a better life. We like high prices, we like low prices, and we like everything just so. This is why the government has to see to it that it runs the government and the people with just enough control for the people to know that they can get along. (HARRY STILLMAN, Picturize Editor.)

Dust Collectors with Belt Cleaner and Dust Transport Filter. The filter system is a modular prefilter, a HEPA filter and a flange seal.\nCleaning with dust filter or suction bag\nThe basic requirements for dust-free production are a dust-free filter concept with adequate dust extraction, a filter system that is installed in the right places and regular maintenance. The HEPA filters used in our dust collectors have an efficiency of 99.995%, so they filter dust very well. HEPA fans are only used with a HEPA filter: these are no longer blow. If a dust extraction fan is to be used without dust filter, this must never be operated in a dusty environment without a suitable filter. The filters must be regularly cleaned to avoid clogging.\nThe dust extraction volume should be sufficient. If the cleaning frequency is too low, the filter may not be able to handle the dust volume. Suction bags provide the possibility of reducing the residual dust content. To do this, the collection bag is emptied and refilled at regular intervals.\nExchange of filter media and dust filters\nThe service life of the filter depends on the size of the filter and the amount of dust. The HEPA filter with an efficiency of 99.995% is refilled when it is contaminated with dust. Depending on the environment, a HEPA filter has a service life of around 10 years. The dust filter, on the other hand, is cleaned and renewed more often. The service life depends on the environment and the amount of dust (e.g. 1 year in the dusty workshop), the size of the filter to be cleaned and the condition of the filter. We deliver replacement dust collectors with filter modules. When ordering these additional parts, the corresponding filters can be reordered later (e.g. for a planned maintenance workshop). For dust extraction, a filter is already part of our equipment.\nThe filter performance depends on the area to be filtered and the amount of dust that must be filtered. The capacity of the filter system is determined by the extraction volume, which is, depending on the type of filter, between 1500 m3/h and 4300 m3/h. Depending on the filter type, it is also possible to filter a high volume through individual filters.\nTo ensure the filter system runs smoothly, it is necessary to clean the entire system regularly and, in the case of dust collectors, the dust bag. Avoid dust build-up by keeping the filters clean, and regularly changing dust collectors and dust bags.\nWhen connecting fans to the filter system, it is important to take into account the requirements for pressure relief from the filter side and the connection.\nDust collectors from the MK product family are dust-tight and do not require a pressure-relief valve. Pressure-loss fans can safely feed into suction systems, which, in turn, can be connected directly to the collection system. If the suction fan does not come directly from the collection system, a pressure-loss fan or an automatic pressure adjustment must be considered for the suction pipe, otherwise the dust filter system may overload or the vacuum cleaner may not operate normally.\nThe same applies to the feed inlet. The dust collector is always connected to the collection system via a flexible tube. A vacuum cleaner is directly connected to the blower with the help of appropriate connections. Since the pressure in the suction ducts does not have to be higher than the pressure at the blower outlet, the suction duct can also be connected to the blower with flexible hoses. A long suction hose is possible up to one meter in length. A second suction hose with a length of maximum one meter is permitted as a connection option if you want to keep the collectors clean without disturbance of production. The suction duct does not allow a high flow rate, so a longer hose should also not be very long.\nDust collectors and dust extractors\nA dust collector can be a filter or suction bag dust collector depending on the situation. When determining whether a dust extractor or fan is required, these points should be noted:\nHow important are the filter requirements?\nWhere does a clean working environment start in the plant?\nIdeally, dust extraction is already used in rooms that do only light cleaning.\nDust collector maintenance\nDue to the increased number of production tasks, the number of workshops in many companies is increasing. The continuous operation of machines, the increasing use of robots and the resulting higher volume of work result in faster and larger amounts of dust formation. As a result, greater dust removal is needed to maintain clean working conditions, especially in workshops.\nAs a result, more frequent maintenance work on pressure-loss and dust collector systems and pressure-loss fans is necessary for dust and dust vacuums.\nIf a machine causes too much dust, a pressure-loss fan will help to reduce the dust load on the system. For example, if a workshop has a lot of dust, a pressure-loss fan should be installed at the supply opening to a vacuum cleaner to reduce the quantity of dust. For small machines, there is a problem with pressure build-up inside the vacuum cleaner. On the other hand, the pressure-loss fan must be connected to the blower at the blower outlet.\nA pressure-loss fan is available in different sizes. The required pressure-reduction can be determined from a pressure diagram of the pressure-reduction system. With the pressure-reduction diagram, it is easy to see at which position the air pressure must be reduced in the vacuum cleaner. The size of the corresponding pressure-reduction fan is easy to find in the corresponding pressure-reduction group.\nIncorrect operating instructions can lead to serious misuse of equipment in dust-and-gas-sealed, clean-room machines. For example, a clean-room fan is not connected to the suction nozzle. If the fan is set incorrectly, it causes a ventilation current within the filter and dust is sucked in again.\nThe use of a separate suction device may damage the system if the correct suction technology is not used. For example, pressure-loss fans are used for simple suction. For a more complex suction system, a dust collector should be used, for example, when installing a fan in a workshop.\nThe use of suction technology should also allow simple maintenance work. Dust collectors, for example, are better suited for this. An additional air vent would be required at the same time. A pressure-loss fan, on the other hand, can only be operated with a duct.\nSuction hose for suction system", "num_tokens_generated": 1480, "OGF": 0.361328125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 34.11273527145386, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 365, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

On the contrary, dark blue or dark green eggs (color change) are undercooked. J. If an egg is rotten, it can be raw, but you can see if the eggs are not white. For example, you can quickly tell if a cooked egg is rotten by the egg yolk, but you can't see egg yolks. If the egg is raw, you'll see a white (transparent) or light gray egg white. But if you're cooking eggs, you can't tell if the yolk is white or blue. The egg will have a dark blue color, which indicates that it's rotten at the moment. K. How to know if an egg is boiled or undercooked? L. If an egg is raw, you can see if the egg yolk is white or not. For example, if a cooked egg is white, it's cooked, and if a raw egg is dark green, it is undercooked. Can be identified? 2. When cooking, you don't need to cook if the eggs are cooked and the egg yolk is white if an egg is not white. A. You can quickly tell if the eggs are cooked and not dark green by looking at the egg yolk. For example, if the eggs are cooked, the egg yolk is white with white white, if it is not cooked, the egg white is brown. If the egg yolk has white or dark green, it is cooked and if the egg yolk is not cooked or dark green (whitish or light gray) egg, it is undercook. But in practice, most eggs are actually raw (egg white is still white), but the egg yolk is black and the egg yolk is not white. L. When boiling, it is not necessary to boil the eggs, because the protein in the eggs dissolves when the egg is boiled (due to higher temperatures). This is why you use water to cook eggs.\nIn the hot pot world, I know I'm cooking eggs like boiling eggs, so it helps me find out how boiled eggs are eaten. I've put together all the information you need to make a healthy hot pot. It's a great way to get started in your home. Hot Pots in the kitchen are very popular and most consumers believe that a hotpot is like a cooked egg, but many of us will also ask what are boiled eggs? Is it the same? Here are the facts and details you need to know.\nWhat you need to know about boiled eggs is that they are both similar and different from boiled eggs. Both are cooked eggs that are fried in boiled water to give a crispy taste, but cooked eggs are cooked differently. I've put together some of the information you need to know and how to cook them as a cooked egg.\nA few weeks ago, we talked about a great recipe that came from my local deli, Hot Potato Salad (or Hot Pot), and how it tastes better than any salad I've tried. While it's not the hottest dish I've tried, I found it a great way to make my life a little easier for the day.\nIt wasn't until the end of summer that I realized I actually liked hot water. And the answer to that question is not at all difficult. You can cook and eat boiled eggs at the same time until you are satisfied with them. The difference is the way you cook them - with the boiling method, the food and boiling times are very different, depending on the food, temperature and other variables.\nThis is because potatoes, in particular, hold heat and have their own flavour. I have been cooking them for too long and I still can't get it right. My answer would be that you first soak the potatoes in cold water for 2 to 3 days, peel the potato skin off the pot and cook it with boiling water for about 5 minutes.\nThere are two methods you can use, firstly you can boil the potatoes in a saucepan and then grill them, like with the boiling method. Here is what I do, I put my potatoes in the pan, then the pot, then the saucepan, cooked them about 5 min and I have had this one for a while. There is no one right way for this, here is what I do and make sure the water is really boiling first.", "num_tokens_generated": 1307, "OGF": 0.319091796875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 29.964266300201416, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 368, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Firstly, although the theory is based upon the birds of Galapagos, and evolution of those species through natural selection, it is yet to be said that the Galapagos Finches were directly related to the main process of evolution. Nevertheless, through studying the Finches, Darwin was able to successfully come up with the theory of evolution, by showing that species of birds differ greatly when their surrounding environment is vastly different. It is only by studying the Finches that Darwin came to the conclusion that the Galapagos Finches were related to the main process of evolution, for it was by studying their surroundings, that Darwin identified the variations of birds, as well as by studying the differences between each individual. This is therefore considered to be one of the most influential factors regarding the theory, as it leads to more evidence of evolution occurring.\nThrough the use of natural selection and adaptation to surrounding environments, Darwin was able to come up with a theory of evolution. For instance, within a finite set of birds were many different species and variations in birds. By observing and studying the different populations of the small birds , it was possible to notice the many variations. This in turn led to the conclusion that the Finches were related because of natural selection. It is through the adapting to their environment that some Finches became so distinctive when compared to others.\nIn conclusion, Darwin\u2019s Galapagos Finches play a large role in the theory of evolution. They are a vital link to the theory, as it is without the identification of differences between each individual that it would be highly impossible for there to be any evidence of evolution occurring. This is therefore considered a strength and weakness to the theory, as by observing and studying the Finches, it allowed evolution to be identified by the differences in each species and within each species. In fact, through studying the Galapagos\u2019 Finches and its surroundings it is considered to be the very core of evolution. However, without evolution the theory would not have been possible, and it is Darwin\u2019s Galapagos Finches who lead the way to the conclusion that evolution occurred.\nAnne, I like the argument in this paragraph \u2013 just needs more evidence for the claims that this paragraph is making. As I said in the workshop, it\u2019s a bit hard to follow \u2013 I think. Could you make it a bit simpler.\n\u2013 \u2018By observing and studying the different populations of the small birds , it was possible to notice the many variations.\u2019 Please identify the bird: is it a \u201csmall brown bird\u201d? I hope not!\n\u2013 \u2018In conclusion, Darwin\u2019s Galapagos Finches play a large role in the theory of evolution.\u2019 Who is \u2018they\u2019? You mean \u2018Galapagos Finches\u2019? Perhaps this sentence should say, The evolution of Darwin\u2019s Galapagos Finches \u2026 \u2018?\n\u2013 I like the link you are making between the finches and Galapagos but you don\u2019t want to use it so much \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to be an information dump! Be very careful about this!\nAnne, you say, \u2018Through the use of natural selection and adaptation to surrounding environments, Darwin was able to come up with a theory of evolution.\u2019 I like your sentence so I\u2019ve retained it, with editing! I like your point about how natural selection has given rise to adaptation to the environment.\n1. Darwin\u2019s finches play an important part in the theory of evolution.\n2. They are involved in the evolutionary change of species.\n3. They are the link between the small changes and the transformation of species.\n4. The theory of natural selection explains their role in the evolution.\n5. The evolution of Darwin\u2019s finches is still affecting the world today.\n3. How would the continued evolution of dinosaurs alongside mammals and birds have affected the development of human civilization, and what impact would it have had on the current state of the world\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity? Would there have been any significant changes in the food chain, and how would this have affected the survival and adaptation of different species? 2. Would there be changes to food chains and changes to survival and adaptation of different species?\n1. How does the theory of evolution help us understand the world?\n2. How does the theory of natural selection help us understand the world?\n3. In what ways is evolution a continuous process?\n4. How does the theory of adaptation help us understand the world?\n7. Could there be any evolution in the world?\n8. Could there be any natural selection?\n9. Why not? What would prevent it?\n1. Do you believe in Evolution?\n2. Do you believe natural selection is necessary for evolution?\n1. Evolution is not a gradual process, rather it is a change in the gene pool that results in the development of new and diverse species. The process is also not constant as it does not occur when there an absence of suitable conditions.\n2. The environment plays a key role in natural selection. The finch\u2019s natural environment had different types of plants and insects and other animals. Hence, there were different environments and various types of finches.\n3. The finches lived in different habitats and were separated by their habitats, which caused them to develop into separate species. The different species evolved through the process of natural selection.\nThe process involved variation which occurred in different species, as well as the changes in environmental conditions. The finches were adapted to different environments, the differences in habitat resulted in the different types of finches. Some species adapted more than others and the finches that adapted better in their environments lived on.\n2. The theory of evolution is considered to be one of the greatest ideas in science that explains the current diversity of the organisms on earth. It was made necessary by an incident when Charles Darwin visited Galapagos Islands from 15th of September- 2nd of October 1835. The finches on these islands were different than those in Darwin\u2019s home island. The finches have different beaks depending on their island of origin and their beaks have been adapted so that they can use to eat specific food. This variation in the finches made Darwin ask whether the finches had migrated to these islands and then had evolved or had evolved from an original species that colonized these islands.\n3. In conclusion, the theory of evolution plays an important part in the understanding of the world and can explain the current diversity of the organisms that inhabit the earth. This is further backed by Darwin\u2019s finches, whose evolution is a part of the theory of evolution.\n1. Why is Galapagos Finches important in the theory of evolution?\n2. Is there any difference between the finches from Galapagos and those from Darwin\u2019s home island?\n3. Why are the beaks of the finches different?\n4. Can you give some examples of the different types of beaks of these finches?\n5. How do the different types of beaks enable the different types of food feeding of these finches?\n9. How do these finches adapt to their food resources?\n2. A finch is a bird, that is, it has the wings.\n1. The evolution of finches is what has caused the finches that live on Galapagos Islands, that are Darwin\u2019s finches (the original ones), to start growing different beaks, depending on which island it is situated.\n2. Yes, there is a difference. They have different colour, different beaks and the ones from Galapagos live more longer because they have no predator.\n3. The beaks are different as they have to deal with different food sources. A long beak is good when eating cactus, whereas a short beak is needed when eating seeds. This way they survive.\n4. Yes, I can name one. A medium sized beak, that is what the ones that live on the other islands have, in order to eat seeds. The Galapagos ones have longer and smaller beaks, in order for them to eat cactus.\n5. The long beak enables them to get all the food from the cactus. The small beak, enables them to eat seeds without any problem.\n6. Well, firstly, they would have to change the DNA in their bodies, if they are going to have a longer beak. A second option, they can migrate to a new island and evolve from there, which is easier.\n7. The current food sources will affect their evolution, as well as their new environment.\n8. Yes, with more food sources for a certain type of finch, there will be more evolution as well.\nThe finches that are the one\u2019s we know today, are actually the original finches, that lived on Darwin\u2019s home island. The finches that are on Galapagos Islands, are actually the ones from Darwin\u2019s home island that have evolved and have different beaks. This process is called natural selection. The ones that had bad beaks were eliminated, whilst the ones that had good beaks for their new habitat stayed.\n1. Explain why the theory of evolution is useful.\n2. What does finches have to do with the theory of evolution?\n3. Why are Galapagos finches important to the theory of evolution?\n1. \u2018The theory of evolution is useful, in order for us to understand the world , as we see different species of the same kind and we do not know how they evolved or how they came into existence\u2019. This means that the world is very complex and we don\u2019t understand it entirely, which is why we should look into, in order to understand how we got here and how we will get there in the future.\n-\u2018The theory of evolution is useful, as we see the change in certain species and we can understand how they became that. Finches are an example of it. The Galapagos ones have different beaks, as opposed to the Darwin\u2019s finches which have the same beaks, but a different colour. This is why finches are important.\u2019\n3. The finches are important because, they explain why Darwin\u2019s finches are different to the ones that he observed on his home island. The beaks have to be different depending on which habitat there is. The ones that are on Galapagos Islands have small beaks, because there is not much food on Darwin\u2019s home island. The ones that are on Darwin\u2019s home island, have long beaks therefore because there is more food there, like seeds. Hence, they are important because they can help further understand the theory of evolution and the change in species.\n1. Explain the relationship between finches and the theory of evolution.\n2. Does the finches support the theory of evolution?\n3. Compare the finches between Galapagos and Darwin\u2019s home island.\n4. Describe the evolution in different species through Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\n5. Explain why there is more birds species on the Galapagos Islands.\n1. \u2018The Galapagos ones have an advantage over Darwin\u2019s finches because there is a lot of food there. So therefore they are going to last longer\u2019. The relationship is that Darwin\u2019s finches are original finches that had to adapt according to their habitat, when they migrated to the Galapagos Islands.\n2. Yes, because there are no natural predators there, so they would evolve differently. Also, the food sources could affect it as well.\n3. Well they had different beaks, according to their habitat so, this is why one of the Galapagos has a longer beak and the other has a shorter beak, in order for them to get their food from the habitat that they are in.\n4. It changed the appearance of the finches and their habits, as they had to adapt to the change in their habitat (Galapagos instead of Darwin\u2019s home island)\n5. The birds species are different because there is a different food sources there, more than on the Darwin\u2019s home island. That is why there is evolution as well, as the ones that have adapted to that environment will live there.\n1. Explain the theory of evolution.\n2. What is the relationship between the theory of evolution and Darwin\u2019s finches?\n3. Give examples about the changes that take place through the finches during evolution.\n1. The theory is that different species of the same kind had to adapt according to their environment.\n-B) Darwin\u2019s finches \u2013 the original finches which have now adapted according to their new environment, Galapagos. They have different beaks\n-During evolution there are changes in the species, and the beaks will be the way to know how the evolution happened.\n3. The evolutionary changes that happened through the finches are the small beak, medium beak and long beaks for eating different kinds of food. On Darwin\u2019s finches, the beak is all the same, because they do not have different habitats.\n1. Do you believe in evolution?\n2. Which evolutions do the finches undergo?\n3. Why do the finches adapt differently in their surroundings?\n3. The Galapagos ones have smaller beaks than the ones on Darwin\u2019s home island, because there is food all over the place, which is why they have lesser beaks for them to be able to get the food. Darwin\u2019s finches have an advantage over the rest, as there are no natural predators, so they would evolve differently than the Galapagos.\n4. The finches adapt differently in their surroundings, because there is food over there, unlike at Darwin\u2019s home island. The ones that lived on their habitat, have small beaks.\n8. Do you believe in it and why?\n9. Why do the finches survive?\nHimmat Singh.", "num_tokens_generated": 3097, "OGF": 0.756103515625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 75.39851784706116, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 374, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

If you were to ask most people what they believe in, you would probably get a multitude of different answers. However, if you were to ask most people what they believe in a specific matter or topic, you would probably only receive a handful of answers. And even then, you would probably have to probe a little deeper to get a clear understanding of what that person believes. I believe that we cannot separate our beliefs from our beliefs because they are closely tied together. Our beliefs may often seem like opinions, but in reality, they are more than that. They are the basis of who we are and how we live. Even small beliefs have an impact on our lives, even when we are not aware of it. Sometimes we may think something is just a coincidence, but that\u2019s probably more of a belief that has been programmed into us since childhood. We cannot understand or appreciate how much of a role our beliefs play in our lives until we take the time to examine them. Even though beliefs are sometimes seen as a source of conflict, they are also a constant in our everyday lives. We use them to help us understand the world and make decisions that affect our lives, even when we do not realize it. So you might ask, what beliefs have I had that I thought were going to help me grow or move toward a goal? Or what beliefs did I hold that I thought were going to help me move from where I was at that time? Well, at one point in my life, I was convinced that I was going to the college of my choice, regardless of the fact that I was not in the right place and did not have the required amount of money. But, as I said, this was a belief. And as such, I had to live with it. However, I did not know what to think or do until I finally realized that I was putting my dreams and desires above my beliefs, which led me to believe that I should\nBudget (2020-2022) for the Fiscal Year 2020, 2021 and 2022 for the City of Victoria, Texas\nBudget (2020-2022) for the Fiscal Year 2020, 2021 and 2022 for the City of Victoria, Texas Budget 2020-2022 2020 and 2021 Budgets 2022 Operating Budget Section 3.80 (1) 314.002 Local government budgeting; 299.016 Property tax collection and taxation; 299.006 Local governing bodies; 11.003 General laws; City Council 299.016(a)(iii) 299.016(a)(xxx) 299.016(a)(xxii) Public Hearing- Budget Workshop Public Hearing- Regular 2.115(a) 3.80 Meeting; 7.110(d) 3.80 Public Comment; and 3.80 Notice: Meetings; 7.110 Public Comment: Public Meetings and Hearings.

There are many reasons people do not attend college. Many people are not interested in obtaining an education. Their parents or friends may not have been successful because they did not attend college. College is a lot of hard work and sometimes does not match your expectations as a career. There are other reasons why people do not choose to attend college. However, most people do not want to get involved with anything that they may not use in a positive way. Some people think they will not succeed with college. They may think that college education is too expensive or take too long to complete. Sometimes people get discouraged because they take too long to complete or are not accepted into a program. People may feel there is too much pressure on them when they get a degree in a certain field. Others may not be able to find a degree in an occupation that meets their needs. It is true that many people do not choose to attend college because of the reasons I have already mentioned. However, there are ways you can still attend college without worrying about all the pressure and expectations. The first option is to be involved with a career plan through a volunteer organization. Some companies hire students through a volunteer program to work in the student\u2019s field of study. The salary is based on the student\u2019s GPA and coursework. There are companies that allow students to work in their field while they attend college. These companies typically offer more benefits, such as tuition reduction and additional job\n\u201cCreed\u201d, Pages 91-110\nFall 2020 \u2013 English 1301 \u2013 Examination for the class\nCreation of the United States and the Re-Creation of the State of Texas\nCreation of the United States and the Re-Creation of the State of Texas The United States and the re-creation of the state of Texas began with President George Washington, an American revolutionary statesman and politician, who served as the first elected President of the United States (from 1789 to 1800), winning the First Permanent Continental Congress and then serving as its leader, and for some time, served as its president. He was the father of the first republic in the Western Hemisphere, making the Declaration of Independence, the drafting of the Articles of Confederation, the development of the Constitution, and many other major accomplishments during his presidency. Washington was one of four men chosen by the Continental Congress to serve as its president (the others being Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay), making him one of four men selected to oversee the writing of the U.S. Constitution. He was also one of 11 delegates to the Continental Congress from the United States and a delegate from the Continental Congress to the British government. The next American revolutionary leader to rise to political power and prominence was Thomas Jefferson, an American President (1785\u20131826) who served as Secretary of State, Minister to France, U.S.\nHow to Decide If You Want to Buy a Boat\nWhen it comes to finding the perfect yacht for your specific needs, whether you live in New York City, or somewhere else in the United States, it is important that you do your research, and have all of the right information before making a decision.

To begin with, it is worth mentioning the role of electricity in the modern world. It is believed that without electricity the modern world would cease to exist. Electricity and its multiple applications in our daily life and human activities have become so indispensable part of our world that we cannot imagine how it would be without it. Electricity influences every aspect of our daily life. The electrical outlet is one of the most indispensable and necessary objects and facilities in our home. We can use it to charge cell phones and other devices, watch television, or listen to music. Moreover, it is used to cool and heat, turn on the bulbs, and power different appliances, such as radios, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, and computers. Even in areas that seem to be unrelated to electricity, it has great influence, for example, in the health care system.

What have writers and thinkers done? In the 1980s, author David Brin's short story The Uplift War explored the theme of how we would cooperate (or compete) with intelligent life on other planets. There've been similar ideas, like Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near (2005). However, there hasn't been a lot of academic and policy-oriented work on this topic.\nThe first issue with the UFO story is that we don't have the data necessary to make any conclusive claims yet. NASA is currently developing methods for detecting extraterrestrial intelligence (i.e. alien life) in our nearby planetary neighbors but this process is in its infancy and could be years away, if not decades. (1) The second issue with the UFO story is that it is very dependent on the notion that extraterrestrial beings traveling through our solar system have come here for a purpose, that being to visit us. This might seem far-fetched but there is a growing number of scientists who think that at least one type of Extraterrestrial Life is here on Earth now. (2) I'll go into this a bit more in the next section but the bottom-line is that some ET intelligent life is coming to Earth and we need to make something clear - they may be here already - which means that they are interacting with us - which means that we need to be ready for that. At the end of this article you'll find a list of videos by a scientist who thinks that it's a matter of when - not IF. Some of his conclusions are also in the top 10 things that we can do now to prepare for Extraterrestrial Life on Earth (as is discussed in this post).\nIt's worth addressing the third issue - the most common objection to UFOs - which is that people cannot be seeing things that are flying from planet to planet and it must be all a conspiracy - a scam from our government. The problem here is that this is one of the least likely scenarios and also that you might not understand exactly what a \"UFO\" is. In general, the term \"UFO\" refers to an unknown object/phenomenon that people have seen but which cannot be explained via science. You can find \"UFO's\" on various websites and you can also ask questions that help you understand what the term really means (see the videos below). (3) This isn't to say that we will not see more objects in our solar system in the coming years, but in the meantime, I want to focus on those that are more plausible.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecrecycouk/ufo-research\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretcouk/ufo-research-and-ufocide\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YnM0DVXJGFYaZ1v2mZH9Q\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ufosecret.org/&ved=2ahUKEwjyv_Pv7MXqAhWGvYUKHYYiDnEQFjABegQIABAA&usg=AOvVaw0wmU1_8DhvKtYqBa6XLZD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4R5qW5cjQxJHU-6mXJ6Zg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YnM0DVXJGFYaZ1v2mZH9\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ufosecret.org/&ved=2ahUKEwjyv_Pv7MXqAhWGvYUKHYYiDnEQFjABegQAgg&usg=AOvVaw0wmU1_8DhvKtYqBa6XLZD\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ufosecretorg/&ved=0ahUKEwjyv_Pv7M\nUFO (Unidentified Flying Object) is a term used to describe unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). UFOs have been reported worldwide and are often described as objects that \"appear to be moving quickly and are changing direction or altitude over a short period of time,\" according to the U.S. Air Force. Since the late 1940s, UFO sightings have been reported by civilians, military personnel, police officers, scientists, and commercial pilots. In fact, many aviation companies and airlines have begun to monitor the skies for these unidentified craft because they do pose a serious threat to passengers. Although the exact causes and identities of UFOs remain unknown, scientists have proposed possible explanations for these mysterious sightings including weather conditions, unidentified flying objects, and other phenomena. Many people who have described UFO sightings have reported feelings of euphoria when they have shared what they have experienced with other people.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretouk/ufo-research-ufo-sightings-ufocides-and-ufo-surveillance\nThe Universe is full of planets. We know this from many observations that have been made by several different kinds of astronomers, both amateur and professional. So it seems reasonable to assume that there are quite a few more planets in our neck of the galaxy than you would expect. Some of these planets may be the same size as our own. But it is also likely that some are not. And some may be even larger than our own. Indeed, if you assume that most of them are quite similar to our own, then there is no reason why they should not be quite a bit larger than our own. If you then combine this with the idea that some of them are orbiting the same star as we are orbiting, then it is quite possible that they could be even larger than our own. Which is why researchers like me, who study exoplanets, are constantly searching for these. I think that the oddest thing about them is that they probably exist, because it is really difficult for a planet to be in orbit around the Sun yet still be able to eject its atmosphere. (1) It is not that hard at all for the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet to escape into space when it is orbiting a star but this is where things get difficult for exsolar planets. If you are to assume that something is large enough that it can orbit around another star, then the only other possibility is that it is orbiting around us. Which means that it should be at least twice as big as our own. But this would make it so large and so large that it would simply go out of control as soon as it got too close to us. We know from experience that planets do not like to get too close to planets, but it really seems as though ours does not. I could be wrong of course, but it does seem very strange that a large object would have an environment like that. One idea that many people seem to have is that exoplanets have an atmosphere around them which will then keep them stable in their orbit around the Sun. But there are many problems with this idea too. To begin with, it assumes that the atmosphere is homogenous. And if it isn't homogenous, then it could well have a density greater than the density of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, which is one tenth of a percent (1/10th of a percent). Even if this isn't a problem, if the atmosphere does not have the necessary density it could well keep the planets cool, which would also be a problem. I am also doubtful that the atmosphere does anything to alter the orbital characteristics of exoplanets. But even if it did, the atmosphere would still be very large and very heavy. So any changes to the atmosphere would have a very large impact on the orbit of the planets and there would be no way to tell that the planets were going anywhere different. For all intents and purposes, they would be the same planet as the Earth in that they are orbiting around the Sun just like ours. The reason that I do not believe that exoplanets have atmospheres is that we know for sure that large planets do not have atmospheres. And we also know that they do not emit much energy, which would be another thing that they would need. If this is indeed the case then it is very likely that these bodies are actually made of solid bodies. They are not in orbit around a large star but instead are orbiting around a very small star. And this would explain why they are so massive.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecret/ufo-research-and-ufo-surveillance\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecrutuks/ufo-research-and-ufo-surveillance\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretorg/ufo-research-and-ufo-surveillance\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretgk/ufo-sightings\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretjy/ufo-sightings-ufo-surveillance-and-ufocides\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ufosecretu/ufo-sightings-ufo-frenzy-and-ufo-surveillance", "num_tokens_generated": 2229, "OGF": 0.544189453125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 52.59102439880371, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 379, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
