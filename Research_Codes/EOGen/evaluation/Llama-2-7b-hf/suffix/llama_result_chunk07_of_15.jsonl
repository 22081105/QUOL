It contains a section called **Finlandia**, because it originally started as a piece of music inspired by the patriotic mood of a poem of that name, by the Finnish national poet Jean Sibelius (1865-1957).\n\nThis piece of music is a favourite at public concerts and has often been used on television and in films, when the composer wanted a strong, uplifting piece.\n\nThe first section, called **Finlandia** and **Finnish Dance**, combines two tunes used by Sibelius.\n\n## Part B\n\nGeorge Frederick Handel composed the **Ode for St. Cecilia\u2019s Day** in 1739.\n\nThe piece is a tribute to the Patron Saint of Music and it has a well-known final section, **The Hallelujah Chorus**. It is called a chorus because of the part it plays. This great, strong piece of music was made famous by the Halle Orchestra and the choir of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, in the early 19th century.\n\n### Part C\n\nIt has been put on at various concerts in all the important cities of the world and the choir can still be heard singing it in the cathedral when Christmas time comes round.\n\n## Part D\n\n**Cecilia** was the first woman in Rome to be buried above ground.\nIn 1849, **Thomas** Moore chose her as an important inspiration for his **Ode to St. Cecilia**, which he wrote to commemorate the occasion of St. Cecelia\u2019s Day, 22nd November. It was written in 1849 at about the same time as he was writing his **Lalla Rookh**.\n\nMoore\u2019s *Ode* was originally set to an almost unmusical accompaniment by Charles Mackley, consisting of only some 15 notes or so, but it was later adopted by several composers and set to music in quite a different way. **Handel\u2019s setting of the text**, however, is the best known and **Mendelssohn\u2019s setting** has a particular charm of its own. It shows that, even if you are a good composer, you can use your skill to produce a completely different effect:\n\n  `\n    _____    ______   _____ _____ _      ____  \n    |   _   | |  ___| | |  ____| |   ____| \\\\\\/ \\\\_  \n    | | |_| | | |____ | | |  _|  | | |_ |   |   | \\\\  \n    |  _ | | |__  | | | | | |__ | |  _| |   |  _|  \\  \n    | |_| | |____| |_| |__| |____| |_| | \\___|   |_| \\_ \\\n      \\__,_| |_______|_\\_\\_______| |_| | \\_|__     |_|_/_/\n  `\n\nMoore also produced **two** poems called **Vision of**, which both included the same musical theme but were entirely different stories: the former described life on a farm, while the latter was a retelling of the old folk myth of \u201cCupid and Psyche\u201d.\n\n### Part C\n\nHandel was **commissioned** to write the music for the poem, but it took almost 40 years for it to be first performed.

One of them is what we call **symphonic**, while the other part of the music for this song does not have a chorus but is **much** lighter.\n\nIts melody was used at one time by an English composer as the accompaniment for another piece of music **called The Lark Ascending**.\n\n### Part C\n\nIn 1856, **Ralph Vaughan Williams** was **ten** years old when **two** little **brothers** came **into** his life.

The new piece was **dedicated** to **William** **Bayard** and composed by **John** ***Sullivan***.\n\nIn 1895, there was a revival of an even older piece of music to celebrate the 500th Anniversary of the Dissolution of the **Priory** of **Leeds**. Its music was adapted by the composer for **14 voices** with the chorus of **80 children**.\n\nThe original piece of music was written in 1548 in Yorkshire by Henry **Guildford**.

The Earth orbits the Sun from east to west, so the locations of the Sun and other heavenly bodies change in night sky. The motion of Earth and the sky appears to change due to the movement of a second axis that is the axis, or axis of rotation, through the Earth The Earth has 3 types of axis of rotation: a prime meridian, an equator, and a pole line. The Earth is always rotating about the Sun, and the Sun appears to be moving through the sky. The equator is about 0 degrees latitude and crosses the Earth along the middle of each hemisphere..\nIt must have been a hot Saturday afternoon when someone at the Department of Environment decided it was time to clean up and throw out everything except a few selected books and documents. Someone did a fairly good job, but left two old filing boxes out of the cleanup. Now it\u2019s 10 o\u2019clock on a Monday night and all of the files that were put into the boxes have been examined by the three men in the room. They\u2019ve been studying these files for most of today and tonight, and they\u2019re sure that not one of them is anything at all. This is the best they\u2019ve come up with for this evening. \u201cOkay guys, let\u2019s discuss it from 10:30 to 11pm before going. I think everyone agrees that we need more time, right?\u201d the project manager of the group, Jeff, asks. \u201cYeah, the guy that was in charge of the files, he was at home tonight, so it\u2019ll be tough to get in touch with him before we\u2019re done. It might be better to get an early start in the morning so we don\u2019t have as much of an opportunity to review what we already have,\u201d Brian replies. \u201cSounds good, but I don\u2019t think we can get started until Tuesday afternoon at the earliest. It might be easier to get into something else, but maybe we don\u2019t want to spend so much time on this?\u201d Jeff replies. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s give it a try. We\u2019re going to start looking through the files we\u2019re already looking through.\u201d Jeff has just checked the files of every person that will be attending tonight\u2019s meeting. Everyone that was here had a file on them. There were only a few files that were not on the list of every person that was here. Those are now being checked.

Why or why not?\nDo you believe in the existence of evil spirits or demonic possession cases? Why or why not? Evil spirits have different names: ghosts, monsters, demons, etc. Demonic possession has been with us since early humanity. In fact, ghosts and demons have been around since the time of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians. In fact, the early Greek myths recorded ghost stories and were full of descriptions of the fearful creatures that haunted the night. One of these creatures was a succubus who preyed on mortal human females in their sleep. Succubi were described as beautiful women with the long flowing hair of a human woman but with the feet and wings of a bird. One of the most interesting aspects of these creatures is that they are thought to have taken on many different forms of mortals. There were stories of demons being human women and possessing young women. It was also noted that they wore animal hide to prevent detection or reveal their shape. The earliest form of a succubus story I am familiar with is in The Iliad which was written by Homer. In it, Odysseus comes to the aid of Achilles after his demise with the Goddess of the Death. The story explains how she was killed by the God of the Goddess of the Death and how she was taken with her to the Underworld. Another example of these evil creatures can be found in the works of Dante Alighieri. In The Divine Comedy, the author takes the reader to Hell where he describes a very vivid and macabre picture of evil. Here, Dante describes the torment that the evil demons inflict upon the condemned. One of the most famous examples of Demonic Possession and Human Evil is the story of the Salem Witch Trials. Though it is a popular tale, the stories themselves take place between 1692 and 1698. During this time, 157 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and the majority were found guilty. This story is one of the earliest known human accounts of demonic possession and human evil. The Salem Witch Trials was a very unique time for humanity. People were being arrested and accused of practicing witchcraft as early as 1692. These trials not only involved witches, but also people accused of being sorcerers, warlocks The main theme.\nHow and why do you organize your bookshelf or bookcase?\nHow and why do you organize your bookshelf or bookcase? Reading has been around for thousands of years. For the longest time, people have had to rely on paper as a medium to learn or study. Since the introduction of the digital age, e-books have become much more popular among readers. The advent of smartphones and tablets has made reading an easy option for every day people. These devices are equipped with large display screens and have the ability to download information or store information in the memory or hard drive. It\u2019s no wonder that these gadgets have become so popular. The first step to reading online is acquiring the proper device to read with. For many people, this device is their smartphone. Whether you use an Apple iPhone or one made by Samsung, these devices are easily portable and have the ability to read text or books from their library. When it comes to books, it\u2019s almost always best to get them digitally. Books that are available on Kindle are cheaper than most and they\u2019re easily portable. Digital and paper books both come with advantages and disadvantages. With digital, you don\u2019t have to carry around a book or a big stack of magazines. The disadvantage of digital is that you don\u2019t always have the book in your hands when you want it. However, if you don\u2019t care about paper, there are e-books that come pre-loaded on one of the device you want. Paper books definitely has their advantages over digital. Paper books are much easier to use and they feel more pleasing to the touch and eyesight. The disadvantage of paper is that you have to carry around all the books you want to read wherever you may be. With that said, you can always have multiple paper books at the same time. Whether you prefer digital or paper, it\u2019s easy to find books that fit your needs.\nWhat are some examples of natural disasters that have occurred throughout history? Provide specific examples of how these events were documented by the ancient Greeks, biblical authors, or in other contemporary sources.\nWhat are some examples of natural disasters that have occurred throughout history? Provide specific examples of how these events were documented by the ancient Greeks, biblical authors, or in other contemporary sources. Earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes are some of the most frightening natural disasters. The ancient Greeks would describe earthquaking as something that was like \u201ca rumbling of thunder\u201d which would occur at night during times of a full moon while people were sleeping. The bible records the prophet Samuel speaking these words to King Saul about the time of judgment: \u201cThe morning sun is dark and bright as the moon\u201d and \u201cFor we have taken a fire to you; I know and believe, but still you will not believe me.\u201d God sent a strong wind to drive out the Israelites out of Egypt. When the Israelites were in a great fear during this wind, there was not any water in Egypt. He did what Moses commanded the people, and in the day of judgment there would be a great storm which would sweep through the land. This storm would have the same kind of storm, as that of the night. In the account recorded by Josephus, who speaks of the destruction of the Great City of Rome, he describes a time when the wind took off a great portion of Rome's roofs. The next day as this storm came to pass, the people in Rome could see the blood of a man who had been killed by lightning. He continues to describe the event by saying that \u201cthis man's skin was turned black, and when he looked like a black devil coming out to destroy the world, people cried out in terror and panic.\u201d In the book of Job there is a very telling section which describes how God created the heavens and the earth. In this section, Job is given the job of teaching people how to fear God for what He does, by saying that one should fear God just as one would fear the storms of the day. The storms of the day are what the earthquakes were meant to illustrate for us.\nHow have you applied the theory that every human\u2019s existence is shaped by cultural influences? Provide specific examples of how this theory has impacted your personal life.\nHow have you applied the theory that every human's existence is shaped by cultural influences? Provide specific examples of how this theory has impacted your personal life. In the following paragraphs, I will explain why, as a young person in America, it's hard to resist influences from your local media. When you look at the history of American culture, one of the dominant cultural influences is the television, and as it is easy to imagine that the television in your house is controlled by the internet. As the internet becomes a large part of your life, it becomes more difficult to resist the cultural influences of the internet. Even though you might like a TV program, the internet always has a higher rating. What is an Internet rating? The Internet rating is the total amount of time you have on the internet and the amount of time you spend on social sites. The Internet rating represents the amount of time spent on the internet and it is a way for you to measure your online activity. Internet rating is not always a good thing when trying to get a better sense of how much time you have on the internet. As an example, the internet has a much higher rating in Japan than in the United States. While a large portion of online activities in the United States take place in Japan, the Internet rating indicates that the internet in Japan is much more important in the culture in Japan. What are some examples of Internet ratings? The Internet ratings were first made public in The Netherlands. Internet ratings for different regions across the world are as high as 300,000 in the Netherlands. The Internet rating is an indicator of the amount of time that you spend on the internet. The Internet rating and the number of people who are active on the internet is in the billions.\nBiodiversity is one of the least known sciences of Biology.\nI don\u2019t know why, but for me, it has always been one of the least interesting things in the world. The main problem is that it is not a complete science in a real way. The only way to understand the term \u201cnatural\u201d is to know that everything around us is \u201cnaturally formed\u201d and that there is no way to understand if something was done by living organisms. One of the main things that make us who we are is\nWhat do you think are the main issues that need to be addressed on Earth today? How can we fix these issues?\nThe Earth is changing. The climate is changing and so is biodiversity. We need to be aware of what is happening on Earth and in the life of our planet. The problems we face today are a lot worse than what we can predict 50 years from today but it has been a long time since the last time we took an Earthquake. Many people are not aware of the changes that are taking place. They do not know how to predict the changes that happen every day. The first signs in the environmental change are seen in agriculture. The main reason is the increasing demand of food. It is important to learn what causes climate change. How to prepare for the future. How to prepare for a rainy world. It is important to see what future is in store for us. It is important to change the environment that is already changing. It is important to make sure that our biodiversity is maintained. Biodiversity is a term that has been used since time immemorial.\nAn introductory paragraph should have the following three elements:\nAn introductory paragraph should have the following three elements: Title and/or Subject(s) The title and/or subject of an essay is what will give the essay a name and its purpose. Title and/or subject of an argumentative essay is usually a statement that summarizes the purpose of the essay. Introduction to Argumentative essay The Introduction to Argumentative Essay is very similar to an introduction for a story. The Introduction to an Argumentative essay is the same as an introduction for a non-fiction story. Introduction to Non-fiction essay A non-fiction essay is a composition that presents information in a manner suitable to a broad audience. It is usually composed of a single sentence (or short paragraph) that contains a specific topic on which a specific audience can understand. Introduction to Non-fiction essay in a way resembles the narrative essay. Introduction to Non-fiction essay in the way that it is an opinion essay, it will usually be a statement of opinion.\nHow does the \u201cSituation in the Country\u201d affect one\u2019s choice of religion?\nChoices about religion are the most personal of all life decisions. The choice of religious belief is based on the feelings of an individual, a region or a country. The choice of religion is personal and personal choices are based on the way one's heart feels about things. For example, \u201cIf I like to go to church, I'm going to go to church.\u201d The belief in religion comes from inside us, and we may find that it may not suit our personality. People may find that a specific religion would help them with their personality, and not just religion. The choice of religion or lack thereof is personal and personal choice. In the case of those who believe in God, there is no need, no need for religion in a world where most people have no use for a God. The choice of religion or a lack thereof may not be something that someone would expect. There is no such thing as \u201cGod\u201d that we have all accepted. God is only \u201cbelieved\u201d by a few people. The choice to believe in a God is based on how one understands the existence of God. When people speak of the existence of God, one thing comes to mind. The belief in a God is based on the existence of a God and the belief in a God.\nHow do you define the term \u201cevil\u201d?\nFor a long time, people have been fascinated with the notion that there are evil people. In fact, evil was a term that was used very often even in the biblical texts. The notion that there exists evil began to fade away with the introduction of technology and modern thinking. Since the invention of the television, there is very little left over that we would define as evil. Today, a lot of people still believe that there is evil. This is because they think that there is something inherently evil in all people. Evil is defined as anything that people consider to be wrong. Evil is any type of behaviour which is considered to be wrong. Evil is when people are doing something which is wrong. In the 20th century it was known as \u201cthe evil within\u201d. It was believed that, when people did good things, they went beyond the boundaries of morality. This view of the world has since shifted and a more complicated view of how\nWhat is the key to writing successful essays that will earn good grades?\nEssays and argumentative essay on the importance and role of science\nThe importance of science is one of the fundamental principles of the study of education.

The association between stress and the risk of developing cancer has been established in many studies. In fact, if you look at some of the top scientific journals in Cancer Biology and Epidemiology \u2013 you can see just how strong the link is between stress and cancer risk. One of the first studies to identify the link between stress and cancer risk was published in 2001 by Dr. Robert E. Lee and his colleagues. They found that the stress of moving and new experiences may be responsible for the higher incidence of cancer in some parts of the world. In the years since, many other studies have been performed by various scientists which have confirmed this finding. These studies have shown that stress is a major factor in causing cancer. They include: Studies from Japan showing an increase in cancer rates in people who have been diagnosed with stress-related illnesses. Studies from different parts of the world showing increases in the risk of cancer in those who are exposed to stress. This study examined the effects of stress on lung cancer rates and its association with smoking. The study concluded that stress-related smoking, which are known to be associated with a number.

Just thought that could make a world of difference. Maybe you don't have to wake up. My sister had the procedure done and was not able to use the pillow or her arm.\nGreat information! Have you had any side affects so far? I am still looking into options because of the risks of having a second c-sec, I'm just a little nervous because it's so drastic.\nGreat explanation! I had mine almost three years ago and I wish I'd read about this first. I wish I'd known that after tubal ligation you would be able to have intercourse without a condom. Now I'm paying more in health insurance, I hope to have a few babies, and I want to use a condom. But my tubes are tied and I can't use a condom. I would give anything to have my tubes tied back open and try to conceive.\nGreat overview. I actually had mine done after my birth in labor and I still consider it a gift of the Lord. I had 6 miscarriages prior to my daughter as my body was not prepared to carry a healthy pregnancy. After my daughter, I had a c-section so I did all three. I would have done the tubes first as well if I had known. If I had to do it over, I would take that exact same procedure route.\nRachel Hollis March 27, 2016 at 6:45 PM\nLove that you put the statistics here.

I was recently asked if I was considering having my tubes tied after one but since I don't plan on having anymore I said no!\nI'm in the middle of my TA now. Had my right side done Feb. 2 with almost no problems. My first week of my menstrual cycle was more painful than the TA itself, but after that the pain was minimal. The best thing is I don't have to use birth control, and that makes me so grateful.\nI also had an epidural for my son, but I don't remember it not working like the lady said- when I went into labor I gave birth with no pain. It sucked, but it had no impact on how I felt during the TA. I also had a little pain in my shoulder but took that up with the anesthesiologist and he was able to fix it with another shot. The only post op pain I have are small sores on my side where they had to get through one of the arteries- pretty normal stuff with any surgery, but the doctor assured me that those shouldn't be painful at all.\nI'm a few years out from my surgery so I didn't give any stats right off the bat, but I will say that the surgery itself and recovery took less than a day. I was on crutches for about 8 hours, and the next day I was walking around without pain. It has been 2 weeks post op and I am still taking Motrin for occasional pain but I am mostly back to normal.\nThank you for sharing this information, I know it is difficult to be honest when writing about things like this because it has nothing to do with weight loss and we are so used to having the \"skinny\" talk in this community. But like I said, I am so thankful for the information and I really appreciate that you included such honest stats about your experience.

I definitely had some questions regarding the pros/cons and how long it would potentially take me to get pregnant again. I ended up getting my tubes tied and I'm so happy with the decision! It was something that I didn't even really have a strong opinion one way or another for, but after having 2 back to back miscarriages, I didn't want to be at risk of having to go through that again.\nThis was extremely informative, thank you so much for sharing! I was wondering how long it takes to get pregnant after a TA?\nThis is so informative! Thank you for posting this, I honestly didn't know if I wanted kids (and still don't for sure) but this clarified a lot and I feel like I understand way better now!\nMeg Taylor March 28, 2016 at 5:19 PM\ni really appreciate that you covered the 'not so positive' things with the tubal ligation. i have a few friends that are considering it so this is super informative!\nI am pregnant, so this information isn't as helpful to me anymore. But I'm definitely going to bookmark this for future reference! Thank you so much for putting the stats in here!\nYou make such valid points about the tubes. People aren't just thinking about that side effect of not having another child, but also the potential risks it could have on a woman. The side I love is women saying, \"If you are done, make this decision for yourself. If you aren't sure, talk to your Ob/Gyn and see how to proceed.\" I do think this is a great solution though.\nKelly @ A Girl Worth Saving March 29, 2016 at 12:30 AM\nI am so thankful for this post. I had a TA a little over 10 months ago. We ended up deciding on that after my c-sections. I honestly have no regrets. I had a 19 month old son, 2 miscarriages, and 3 pregnancies total. The risks of me not wanting to have more children, the surgery itself, the 6 weeks without intercourse, and the risks of another c-section were all in line with the decision. The thing I struggled with the most after the surgery was the 6 week no intercourse rule. It was so hard for me to get myself to start having intercourse again. Luckily he was out of town for that six weeks which made it a bit easier. I was so scared I would \"screw up the procedure\" or \"start having babies, even if only 1.\" Now I get to wait 6 weeks with him here since he is home for the summer! It's my first time in 5 years not in a relationship that we can have sex whenever we want. I love it! I have no symptoms at all. My menstruation has gotten a little lighter (more in tune with when I ovulate) and even stopped getting cramps for a while. We are still working hard on getting pregnant again for our 3rd. He was born in our first trimester due to a miscarriage, born early (due to a bleed for a cervical laceration) and is born 3 months too soon on the dot. We really want to give it a second try and see if we can have a healthy pregnancy, birth, and stay full term. I think the risk being pregnant would take is out weighed by the risk of a c-section or having another miscarriage. It was hard to tell a good friend I was pregnant this far along again and have to go through another miscarriage so we decided to get it fixed first. Even though my first miscarriage happened after our tubal ligation, I think for any women who has had or is having problems becoming pregnant, I recommend getting it done with some confidence in your mind already. I love you and love your honesty. You are so brave! Thank you for giving this post. Tough stuff!!!\nSusannah March 29, 2016 at 9:10 AM\nOh, goodness, your experience is very similar to mine (although I had four miscarriages and was TA'd after two c-sections, not three)! It sounds like we have much in common. Hang in there, Kelly...the risk of miscarriage can be reduced through dietary changes, eating more of a high-quality meat intake, as well as supplementation. Good luck to you! xo\nKelly @ A Girl Worth Saving March 29, 2016 at 1:19 PM\nI would also recommend fertility awareness based awareness cycles. There is a really good book called \"A New Beginning\" by the Kris-Ceely method, or check out the facebook group \"It' a Girl's World\", or the blog \"The Fertile Soul\" to learn more.\nWren March 29, 2016 at 12:40 AM\nThanks so much! This was very informative!

I think you're actually just fine! My friend is about 25 and had a tubal ligation and got pregnant right away. I'm almost 28 and was pregnant right away.\nMomma You Did March 29, 2016 at 9:35 AM\nThis is SO informative. I think for me - I am not ready to be a parent yet or have kids in general, so I am not really considering this yet.\nShaylee Ann March 29, 2016 at 11:07 AM\nI think this is a very informative post and you really covered so many different aspects to think about both the pros and cons of tubal ligation. I feel like it is a big decision and definitely want to look into my options when the time comes for me to be \"done being pregnant\" for sure!\nThanks for sharing. This sounds like it was quite scary. That said, I think this is a great option for some women. There are plenty of other things I'm scared to do but in the end they usually turn out good.\nMallory @Chaos & Coffee March 29, 2016 at 6:40 PM\nI know a few people who have had this done and it's great to get the real facts and not the glossed over ones. Thanks for providing!\nTia March 30, 2016 at 4:27 AM\nGreat post! I had a TA done before my first child, because I definitely didn't think I wanted more children! After having my son and dealing with 3 pregnancies, I feel so much better about my decision. But as you said, the decision to get the TA is different for everyone!\nSara-Jayne Jones April 1, 2016 at 10:30 AM\nThis was a really informative post. I was actually thinking of getting a tubal ligation but I may be too young. Also I didn't have three miscarriages so I was wondering if I could be in the same situation as you where you are unable to have children naturally. I do know a few people who have had a TA which was successful for them. If it means that I cannot have children then I would be okay with it.\nLauren @ She Moved to Texas April 1, 2016 at 10:49 AM\nWhat a wonderful, well balanced post. I think the main point is, whatever decision you make, know why you're making it.\nMy mom had 4 before having a TA. Although pregnancy is something that can't be denied (as she has been pregnant 2 or 3 more times after her TA) I think she did the right thing for herself. She loved parenting and was so sad after all of her lost miscarriages to let anyone else go through that.\nI am a little young to have my tubes tied, but it is something my mom would have done. As I am in no rush to have kids, I think I'd rather do it for my own satisfaction than to be pregnant. I would like to try and get pregnant soon after, in this way I think it is the safest for me, but if not we would love more kids either way.\nSo glad I found your blog.", "num_tokens_generated": 3478, "OGF": 0.84912109375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 85.38949728012085, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 453, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

If not, why?\n\nComment: It would be helpful if you could use a proper unit of measure for your pressure values in the answer instead of using that mysterious \"$[V] $\\\" stuff. It looks like a mixture of units to me. That said, are you certain that your calculation from pressure to volume is correct? You have some units that don't add up.\n\nComment: I have to choose between pressure and volume. How do I know the correct ones?\n\nComment: You have two unknowns that are dependent on each other. Which is your problem. You say your calculator gave you the wrong answer or pressure. So either it is wrong, or you are using the wrong pressure data. I don' see where you can get from pressure and volume in millimeters of mercury to a number in units of ul. Unless you got the units wrong the first time.\n\nComment: For instance: 0mmHg and 100mmHg, since i know how pressure affects volume, I can get it in uL. How do I know how much pressure affects volume?\n\nComment: First of all, you need to clarify if the question assumes you use the pressure at the point and the tissue pressure (assumed to be equal if the question doesn't say so) are not the same, or if the question assumes you use the tissue pressure and that is the same as the point pressure. Both conditions are different, which one is meant? Otherwise, assuming that they are they same, you can use Poises.\n\nComment: I am not sure what you are saying here.\n\nComment: My calculator says the answer is 100uL...\n\nComment: I'm pretty sure they mean you need 67uL\n\nAnswer: I think you are mixing units. Try to express it all as mmHg.  I hope the comments below are not misleading about pressure not being required- it is.  I assume you are given the point pressure at one place and the subcutaneous tissue pressure at another.  You find the permeability coefficient $P_t/P_p$ assuming the pressures are the same at the point and subcutaneous.  The rest is all pretty simple.  A rough approximation is to assume the permeability coefficient is independent of pressure- it is not- by the way, you have no way of knowing what happens in the tissue.  There is no simple way to calculate this without a fairly sophisticated knowledge of fluid mechanics.  You might get lucky because it might be possible to make a pretty good assumption (I have just found this example when I thought I knew everything).\n\nComment: I know it's wrong I just don't know how.  And I think it's also important for me to know the pressure because I don't know which pressure to use is subcutaneous or critical.\n\nComment: The solution manual doesn't explain what you're saying. I'm confused.\n\nComment: I assume it says you should take the pressure difference between the blood pressure and either the subcutaneous tissue pressure.

The angle of incline is represented by the Greek letter of \uf068 with the symbol ...2. What is the work done by a 35-newton force when it moves an object over a distance of 2 m? Solution. We know F = force W = work done. 35 N = force W = work done 2 m = distance x 35 N = work done. Here, work done x distance = F x d = \u0194 x d. 1 Joule = 1 N x 1 m. 1 N x 2 m = 2 Joules.

The sum of the work done by the two forces is also equal to the increase in kinetic energy of the rocket in which case $50 J = 750 J$ 6. The work done against gravity reduces the kinetic energy of the rocket by $5 J = 750 J - 750 J = - 250 J$ 7.We will be calculating the following: Work done by force of 30 newtons for moving a vehicle a distance of 2 meters, work done by force of 4...Answer (1 of 6): Mechanical energy is dependent on the mass of an object and the height and velocity of that object. Momentum is dependent...Calculating the Work Done by a Force When an object moves, the work done by the sum of the forces is equal to the change in kinetic energy (see section 2), so Work =\u2206KE. Work is measured in Joules, and work is calculated for each force acting during the displacement. For an object at rest, work = 0 J (see section 2b).This force is a 25 N force , and a constant force. The displacement for this object is 5 meters. The acceleration for this object is 15cm/second squared. The net work done by the force is\u2026 A. -1.25J B. 0J C. 1J D. -1J Answer Key: A) -1.25J Explanation: First you need to figure out how much work your force is doing, then how much more or less the work it was doing before you applied that force.For example, an object of mass 1kg travelling at 5 m/s, has a kinetic energy of 10 Joules. As 10 joules equals 10Nm (the energy to lift an object the same mass up by 10cm) the kinetic energy can be calculated as: 10 joules = 10Nm where the mass of the object is 1kg = 1N.23.7x103J22 x 1010 kg = 3.6 x 1010 J200kg x 14m/s2 = 2.8 x 103 J When the speed of the vehicle changes you get more work done, and therefore more energy changes. The force of gravity is given by Fg = mgh = mass x gravitational field x height, so Wg = mass x height x 9.81m/s2 or Wg = ... 4 6 For example if you \u2026\nthai sellershousing loan interest ratesbanker bags with shoulder strapwalmart rugs paddedcheap wedding dresses by colorselongated chucksblack faux fur jacketmcm usawallet faux\nThe work done by a force on an object depends upon two things: the magnitude of the force, and the distance the object is moved because of the force. The work done, known as a force, is not a constant, but depends on how fast the force is being applied to the object. The magnitude of the force is what causes the acceleration of the object.Force is the push or pull exerted on an object. Work is the force applied on an object in a certain direction multiplied by the distance traveled. For example, if a force of 3 Newton is exerted on an object, causing the object to move by 4 meters in a particular direction, the total work done by the force is 12 Newton meters (3 x 4m x 3.28).Answer (1 of 22): Work is a scalar value, meaning the result is the same regardless of whether the object to which it refers is large or minute. Force acts on an object in a certain direction, so an object may be pushed, pulled, or lifted. Work done by a force on an object doesn't depend on whethe...A force is said to do positive work on an object if the motion of the object in the applied force's direction is an increase in speed. Suppose you are pushing a car. You are applying a force to push the car in the same direction as the velocity of the car. In this case, the car's speed increases and the positive work is done by your force.If the force applied is 200 newtons and the distance traveled is 50cm, the work done by the force is going to be 200 x 50 cm. This is 10 Newton Seconds, or 10 Joules. Calculate the work done by a force on a mass with different units of measurement. The units of force is the Newton (N). If you have a Newtons force pushing against the direction ...There are 2 ways in which work can be calculated:1. Work as a measure of the displacement in space for a force multiplied by its magnitude The work done per unit is the force per unit area (pressure) The work done can also be calculated by multiplying the distance (d) and the force that is acting (F) The SI unit for work is the joule which is equal to a newton ...For instance, the force of gravity is proportional to the mass of an object and the \u2026The acceleration due to gravity is a simple, known variable. If a mass (m) is falling from a height (h), the work done to bring it down is equal to the force of gravity multiplied ...What is the work done by a force of 70N when it moves an object over a distance of 50m? Solution: We know F = force W = work done Where 70 N = force W = work done 50 m = distance 70 N x 50 m = 3.5 x 10 5 J. Note: Work done x distance, is the energy spent to move an object. This energy, as measured in joules, is called Work done. In the video, the work done by a force of 10 N pulling an object 10 m in the direction of force is.Work = force x distance traveled W = 20 j. W = 20 j. Thus, the work required to overcome the opposing force of 2000 N is 2000 j . W r =2000 j. For a body of mass 2 kg, the potential energy is 6 000 J at the point and the kinetic energy is 550 J at the same point. For a body to fall from the top of the cliff, there is the same work done as ...\nbest lens zoomdillards bridal dresspink tassel loafersxfinity remote programmecoat hookshome renovations2 door refrigeratorblack sweatshirtswildstyle tattoosideal protein nutrition", "num_tokens_generated": 2368, "OGF": 0.578125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 56.384525299072266, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 462, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

View more, A body is moving along a fixed circular path of radius 5 m at 15 km per hour. a 375-lb crate is to be pushed on a horizontal level floor with the edge of a 4-ft.-wide plank the block weighs 110 lb and the coefficient of friction between block and surface is 0.1, a 150 lb car is being pushed, from rest, by a force of 402 lb. In order to calculate this, we would take 2.5kg x 9.80 N/1kg = 23.8 N. Answered: One wheel of a large truck has a weight of 310 newtons. So when it is said that a force does 30J of work, it means 30J of energy has been transferred out of the system, such that when the force is taken away, the system will move no further. That is, a force of 100 lb which acts horizontally on a small body 5 ft from the point of application will do 25 J of work if it moves the body 1 ft from its original position, and does 5 J of work if the same force moves the body through a distance of 5 ft. Work is defined as force acting through an angle. Since the net force on the particle is zero, the particle moves with an acceleration of 0m/s^2 to the right. How much work is required to move a 6000 N truck 5 m against gravity? 5 J. This will make a total of 20J of work to be done on all of the pieces which makes each piece do about 4 J of work and that is equivalent to 141 J of work for the entire body. When one of them moved 49 feet on a path from A to B, the second one moved 39 feet. The total work done on the system will be the sum of the work done for one body at a time. 42 J of work is definitely required to do this work. A stationary particle moves to the right with zero initial acceleration. It is clear that the work is being done against gravity for 16N (force) in the direction of 90o with a force (N) and a distance of 5m, which makes the whole situation a 5 times more complex process and hence makes it quite difficult to calculate the same. Answer A 600 Newton force acting on a 600 Newton object in the given direction moves that object 5 meters. What is the magnitude of the force that was applied? In order to calculate this, we would take 2.5kg x 9.80 N/1kg = 23.8 N. The units are Joules, as are all of these answers. 6040 (0-560)= 5380 J. (1). This is because the force applied on the particle is perpendicular to the position of its initial state, therefore, the force applied in moving the particle to its final position is parallel. It can be calculated for the force applied on the moving body or a stationary body or even on the object in different states of equilibrium or motion. An example is the reaction to a push, or the force needed to stop an object, which causes it to move in the opposite direction. Exercise 1 10N is the force in the direction of the arrow (the angle \u03b8 given) and 5M is distance moved (the arrow is pointing the way a force is taken along a directed line). You know that one joule of work is equal to 1 newton metre and that a force of 5 newtons (or 5 joules) can lift a weight of 0.05 newtons. Hence, the force of 600N in the vertical direction produces a change in the velocity of 4 m/s. Hence, the work done. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.5. A force of 10 newtons moves an object through 2.5 m to the right. A newton meter is a unit of work, or potential energy, equal to the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass to a velocity of one meter per second in the direction of the force produced. The work done by this force on the object is negative. By how much more does the total work change when the force is changed from 3.00 N and 4.50 m to 5.00 N and 1.00m? Work is done when a force is applied in the direction of motion or against it. If this happens, we call this the work done by the force in the horizontal direction, since (in this case) this is the motion against which the force is applied. This work is done when you perform a force that increases the distance by which the object is moved. If the force is 24 N applied in the positive z-direction the work is 24 J. You work for 20 minutes to lift 20 bags to the top floor of your house. This page requires the most recent version of the Adobe Flash plug-in and JavaScript support. A force of 100-lb pulls a rope across a pulley. There are different ways to measure it and one of the best units of measuring work is the Joule. One N is just a little less than half of an English Pound. One joule is approximately the energy required to lift 2.2 grams of water \u2026 The total (combined) force is a force of 50 Newtons . The distance traveled is 1 m. What is the work done by this force on the object? The unit Nm is newton-metre. A force of 120 N would do 240 J of work. A 100-kg crate moves from rest by being pushed with a force of 200 N for a distance of 8 m. a. Calculate the work done by a 84-N force that is applied at what angle with respect to the horizontal to move a 3-kg crate to the right? Answer = 0.013 N M The total work required is 35J when the distance moved by the body is 10m so we can say that the amount of work required is 13J to move the object 5m and is equal to the displacement which is 5m. A body, whose mass is 4 kg, is moving forward in a frictionless air with a speed of 2 m/s. A 1800-lb cart stops from a speed of 4 m/s in 2.0 s. Determine both the force exerted on the cart and the net work done on the cart. 6040 (0-459)= 5591 J. The work done equals force times distance, as you saw in Work Done for Constant Forces: The unit of work is the joule (J). The force and displacement must always be in the same direction for work to be done. An 80,000 kg tractor pulls a 4000 kg car, and a 20,000 kg truck, out of a ditch, as shown in the figure below. When one of them moved 49 feet on a path from A to B, the second one moved 39 feet. In the equation, F = [mass x gravity x height], the mass cancels out and yields the gravitational force as a direct function of the acceleration (g) and height (h). So, the work done, W, in moving the ball the distance \"d\" from its position is W = Fd If F = 1 N and d = 5 m, then W = 1 Nm What is the work done by a force of 36 Newtons that moves an object 2 m across a rough horizontal surface? Work is the amount of energy needed to cause an object\u2019s motion or to increase its speed. Work is positive when the motion of the object is in the same direction as the applied force and negative when the motion of the body is in the opposite direction of the applied force. A body experiences an acceleration equal to 0.40 m/s 2 if its net force equals 40.0 N. How much further does it travel if the net force stays constant? It can be thought of as the amount of work needed to lift a certain mass \u2026 Answer = The force exerted on an object is measured in the unit of dyne and work in the unit of joules. (a) In a situation where a horizontal force of magnitude 30 N is applied on a particle in order to increase its speed, what should be the total work done until the speed becomes 3 m/s? How? An object does work when a force acts on it to cause it to move a distance. a. Answer A work is defined as an amount to be expended overcoming the resistance from the applied force. How much work is required to bring it to a stop from that original speed? (b) If the force causes it to move 6 m, find the work done. However, the work of an inclined plane varies linearly with displacement (as in Equation 9.3.1). This energy is absorbed either in the form of light or heat or sound. The first rule is that all forces are equal and opposite. Now, if you apply a force of 100 N, you\u2019d have to go 20 m before you\u2019d exerted 100 J of work. Determine the work done in stopping a 12 kg cart? 6040 (0-499)= 5481 J. For each position, determine the applied force. Which is the force that is acting on the ball? The net force on the system is zero, for both cases. You have been appointed as a security consultant of a company that employs 6000 N. What is the work to be done in each of the following. You have to multiply the force by the distance moved to get the work. An object does 1400 J of work when you push on it for a distance of 32 m. The work done by a force of magnitude 50 N is -400 J. Therefore it comes under the category of work done. The force (N) must be used in the denominator because: 49 kg x 9.81 ms^{-2} = 455N. 6040 (0-399)= 5401 J. The units of work are joules and Newtons. 6040 (0-560)= 5380 J. It also means that the work is done by an applied force of 5.38 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.5. Now, let\u2019s find the force. What is done for a force of 32 Newtons applied to the object? The force has to be applied for a distance of 4.25 m in the same direction as of the applied force. For any force, as long as the motion is constant, work done will always equate to the applied force multiply distance. When an object is moved from one position to another, there is an exchange between the object and the system in the form of energy. 3.0 J. 3) An object is dragged across a level floor by an applied force of 60 N while at an angle of 60 degree. How much work is done when a force of 100 N is applied across a force table that measures just 600 N, such that the weight of the force applied is offset by the force table? (b) What is the net force acting on the block if the applied force is 50.0 N at 60.0^ \\circ ?. So as work is done by the object when it has a displacement. The force does 1.5J of work when the body moves 4 m, and 0.5J of work when it moves 3 metres. What is the net force on the system? There will be two forces acting on each cart. The work is being done against the gravitational pull of the earth (12.5J/kg x 12 kg = 156.2J). The formula for calculating the work done is, When a force is applied on an object in a direction perpendicular to the position of the applied force, the object moves a certain distance, this process will result in work being done on the object because the force applied is in the opposite direction to the displacement of the body. So, we will apply that force over a distance of 1 km. b. This will make a total of 20J of work to be done on all of the pieces which makes each piece do about 4 J of work and that is equivalent to 141 J of work for the entire body. The work-energy theorem states that if you do work on an object, there is a corresponding increase in its kinetic energy by an equal amount. Which of the situations below is not an example of Newton's first law of motion? What do you mean by Work Done and Energy Done, What do you mean by Work Done and Energy Done How do you derive expression for work done in the case of Constant force. A body of 4 kg is displaced by 2m from its equilibrium position with an acceleration of 2 m/s2. Work can only be done if the body in motion is moving in a direction opposite in direction to the force applied. This work is done when you perform a force that increases the distance by which the object is moved. If the object were to move a distance of 5 m instead, 25 J of work will have been done. This work is done when you perform a force that increases the distance by which the object is moved. The force of gravity is always acting inward toward the Earth. The work done in the horizontal direction is called the work against which the force is applied. You are pushing on the piece of wood with a force of 100 Newtons. What is the work done by an object of weight W as it moves a vertical distance y to the right under the influence of a frictional force with magnitude of magnitude F, (where y F y) What do you mean by Work Done and Energy Done How do you derive expression for work done in the case of Constant force.

I have a two-story home (2200 sq foot). 2. It has two thermostats, one in the hallway (fellow's room) and the other in the family room. 3. Both have heat pumps and are controlled by the respective thermostats. 4. They're both located in the same area of the home, not in the attic. 5. I thought about running two different lines off the fan so that one line is connected to one system and one line is connected to the other system. So, depending whether the fan is on in one area of the home, so is the heat pump in the same area. Problem is that I would also like the heat pump that is not controlled by the thermostat (but by the thermostat in the hall) to stay on as long as the thermostat in the hall is. So, I was thinking this would be a problem because of my concern about the heats pump in the hallway being on longer than the one controlled by the thermostat in the hall. Does anyone see any flaw in this? Also, even if there is no flaw, is the fan powerful enough to both control the flow of air and run the heat pump? 4. The heat pumps have two wires (hot & neutral), the fan has two wires (hot & neutral). Is it this simple to run dual (or in my case, triple) lines?\nCan a 30 amp fuse be protected by a breaker?\nIt is illegal to use a breaker to fuse a vehicle to the battery or fuse the battery to a vehicle. What is it legal to do is to use a breaker to fuse 240 volts/20 amps to the vehicle and a breaker to fuse the vehicle to the 12 volts/10 amp battery.\nDo heat pumps make sense for a moderate climate?\nThe answer depends on your location (governed mostly by relative humidity) and your climate needs. Heat pumps are the most efficient way to go. A heat pump moves heat from one place to another. You could go with an ordinary air-conditioner for the summer (which is the reverse of what a heat pump does). Then, when it gets cold, have your ordinary cooling system switch over to be a heat pump (which uses about 40% less electricity). You could save on the average $600 a year in combined cooling costs. Now, as to the original question: does it make sense to replace your A/C unit with a Heat Pump and have your regular heat system act as AC in the summer? To do so, your furnace would have to act as a Heat Pump in the summer but, unless it's a new furnace, it won't because a standard/conventional furnace won't operate in reverse, unless it's a Geo Thermal system, which most people don't have. You're better off with just an A/C unit and a separate geothermal heat pump. To further explain, a typical electric A/C unit and an electric Heat Pump have identical electricity draw. To make it work in the \"heat only\" mode, you need a furnace capable of going from regular heat \"mode\" to gas or electric heating \"mode\". They're called \"dual fuel\". In fact, new home construction includes duel fuel furnaces (gas and electric) as standard. And, if you have a duel fuel A/C and heat pump, it will add about $1500+ to the cost. Most homes are built with only a 2-pipe A/C unit which contains the heat and A/C components integrated in one device. In addition, the HVAC system needs to be re-wired, so it will all work together. You should only consider a heat pump for heating. For cooling, AC units are just fine and cheaper and, if you need humidification, get a 2nd small AC unit since the first heat-pump will de-humidify the house and this is required in any room for humidification.\nHow is a pressure cooker/pressure cooker pressure regulated?\nThe pressure is regulated by an arm which moves back and forth with a piston.", "num_tokens_generated": 967, "OGF": 0.236083984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 21.973367929458618, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 465, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

So if I have the force of 300N and the magnitude of acceleration, 5 m/s^2 then my force equals my acceleration times my mass. In that case you can measure the pressure on a fluid (gas or liquid) exerted by gravity by weighing the fluid (a weighing balance), and you can use that formula. So it would be 3N. Acceleration of 20 m/s / 1000 = 0. 5kg, the maximum acceleration 0. 8 N/m squared. 8 * 1000 = 5000 N m. 200 N. 84 m/s^2 m/2 = 65 j m 0. When accelerating at constant rate, we know that, force = mass * (a / d). Then you apply it in the formula of acceleration , and you will get your answer. So the acceleration of a free fall is 9. Newton's second law of motion: This law states that the net force acting on an object equals the mass of the object times the object's acceleration. It has a net force of 300 N and an initial speed of 20 m/s, so its acceleration is 300 N/(20 m/s) = 15 m/s^2. The Acceleration Formula Formula A = \u0394V \u0394t A = V 2 V 1 t 1 t 2 A = Acceleration, m/s 2 \u0394V = change in velocity, m/s \u0394t = change in time, seconds V 1 and V 2 = initial and final velocity in the same direction 1000 N (3. 0N (100 N/3kg) = 33. 116/2 = 1. 2 m/s 2 * 65*3 = 131. 00 297-216 083 705 12\u00d70. 287 = 19. 6kg. 19. So, 5kg x 9. A 5 kg body is accelerated uniformly 4 m/s2. For example, if you are driving your car and it starts from 0 km/h to 100 km/hr in 10 seconds, then it is undergoing uniform acceleration. Mass is force (N) divided by acceleration, so force = N/g or the amount of weight divided by the constant of gravity to cancel it out. Let's apply this equation in acceleration of a body:. Acceleration of free fall is the constant acceleration of 9. 2259 = 0. Mass of body is 10 kg, so it means 10 N. 4 kg = 5 N. 71 kg/s \u22c5 0. 8 N/m 2 and a 4kg mass has a \u0394V/\u0394t ratio of 2. 2 m/s^2 or 32. But in simple words, it signifies that if the force (F) is directly proportional to body mass, then acceleration is inversely related to body mass. So the acceleration is 2 times higher (32 - 16 = 16). So 10-11 N/m of pressure will produce the same acceleration as 9000 N of pressure on a fluid. 00N/kg, the max acceleration we can acheive on earth is only 4. So acceleration is given by the equation: a = F/M. A 25-kg basketball player accelerates from a speed of 5. 5m/s or 28. If we look in a standard Physics text I find the formula for acceleration is the net force divided by the mass. The coefficient of air resistance is given by the formula, Cd* 1. F = 0. 2 kg * 2. F = 5. 650 kg/m/s\u00b2 or 5650 N/m. acceleration formula is given by $F = m * a$ where $F$ is force $m$ is mass and $a$ is acceleration. The acceleration can be calculated by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the acceleration produced by a force is directly proportional to the magnitude of that force and inversely proportional to the mass of an object where acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. 6715994617 = 9. So, the force on a 30 kg object, moving at 10 m/s through the air, is 6 Newtons. So we get acceleration 1294 m/s 2 Now, 9. Suppose the man in the box is 80 kg. 2 kg and the force is 20 N. A 5 kg object has a mass of 5 x 10 2 N or 500 N. This acceleration is always the same, so it is called a constant. The acceleration of gravity on the Moon is slightly more. A car 2000 lbs is accelerating such that it is going from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds. We have found mass of man, force required for accelerating 5 kg is 400 N and acceleration which is the result of the force is 9. For gravity (on Earth) a = g = 9. 2m/s\u00b2 and 1 kg accelerates at 9. 5kg, and a 200lb man would accelerate in the same way in 0. If a force F is applied to the 5 kg mass, for what acceleration will it move? acceleration=F/5. So there is no difference between calculating speed and calculating acceleration. = force. 81 and the acceleration of the 1 kg object is zero. 6110, the acceleration of the 3 kg object is 5. 5 * (9. The mass of the ball (mass of the ball = 0. Force= mass * acceleration . If the acceleration of a body is given by, acceleration = F/M = Wd2 /M where F is force, W is the weight of the particle, M is its mass and d is its displacement. 50\u00d710-3 kg/N . 1kg (1000kg) and you apply a force of 20 N on it. Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is equal to the net force on the mass divided by twice its mass. The acceleration of the moon is zero when the force of gravity acting on it and the apparent force of gravity acting on the earth are combined due to which the acceleration is zero. So it is zero and the object moves with constant and zero acceleration. 20 N , the acceleration is given by F = m \u00d7 a and so a = 20 \u00d7 1000 F = 9. The acceleration formula is: In this case, F = mass x force. A 1kg mass is subject to the force of gravity and accelerates for 1s. 4 m/s / 1000 = 0. The formula of 9. 123456. 25, and the magnitude of acceleration of the car is 30 m/s2. The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is zero, since the net force acting on an object on the Moon is zero, that is, the magnitude of the gravitational attraction that pulls the object in the direction of gravity is cancelled by the magnitude of the attraction of the object towards the Earth, so as to produce zero net force. 200 N is applied on a body of mass 10 kg, what will be its acceleration? As, a = F/m So acceleration of a body would be, = (force \u00d7 mass) / mass So acceleration of a body will be, a = 200 N \u00d7 10 kg = 2000 N m/s\u00b2 Acceleration = 2. 360090843 N. But, then, what if an object is accelerating uniformly in one direction? In that case, I can still use a = F / m, because the force does not change, only the mass. Mass m and acceleration \u03b1. So for constant acceleration 5 N of force, the 200 kg body can attain the maximum acceleration of 20 m/s^2. 3N/kg. 0 N/m squared, and 200 kg = 200,000 N. This means that the body of mass 100 kg should apply a force of 10 N if it has to experience an acceleration of 10 m/s 2 . Mass of object is 10 kg. I'd have to look that up, but I have a rough guess that a 1000 kg rock might fall 2 m/s^2 slower than a less dense 20 kg mass rock. This acceleration of mass 1000g is 98m/s 2 This acceleration of mass 200g is 18. The formula a = F/m is called Newton's first law of motion. 03 * 4. 5g to 50 g mass can produce acceleration 5 g when they are given the same force. 80 kg and accelerates at constant acceleration = 20 m/s^2. So acceleration depends on a lot of things if you want to know the exact acceleration one must know about the mass of object, distance between center of mass and applied. Now, force (550 N. 5N and 10 kg (1000 N) would give them the same acceleration. If mass of man is 2000 lbs, acceleration is given by the formula F = ma. The Force & Mass of a Person. F = 200 N. The weight of the 200 kg (200 000 N) skier is the same as on Earth and the acceleration is given by the equation a = g = 10 m/s 2 So the acceleration will be the same! The acceleration a of the skier, will also be constant! If the force F is applied to the box, and the box is empty, by Newton's 2nd law, the acceleration will be a = F / (rM) where M = mass of box, r = radius of the box and F = force. 981 m/s/s or 10 m/s\u00b2 (10m/s). So in order for an acceleration of 10 m/s 2 in the first second, for instance, this means that the acceleration will be 5 m/s\u00b2 in the second second 5 m/s\u00b2 in the third second and so on. a = m X g. The change in velocity is equal to: delta V. This acceleration of mass 1000g is 98m/s 2. The acceleration can be calculated by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the acceleration produced by a force is directly proportional to the magnitude of that force and inversely proportional to the mass of an object where acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. 5 kg; what is the acceleration of the object? 10. If acceleration is 2m/s^2, what is the mass, given that it is in equilibrium with a gravity of 9. 33 m/s2. The coefficient of air resistance is given by Cd* 120 Kg = 1 kg (1000 N) Forward in this example. The acceleration formula is F=MA, so for a=9. the acceleration of a person\u2019s body can be calculated, using a=F/m. The acceleration formula states that acceleration of an object mass m is equal to force acting on that object divided by its mass. 512 or the same as 1 N. Force is Newtons. 0 m/s2 , and the force is 20 N. How to calculate the force, if you already have the acceleration and the mass? Acceleration of a Body: Let us consider a body of mass m and it is moving with a constant velocity v at t = 0 seconds. Then, acceleration is given through formula a = F/m, the force F divided by mass m. If mass is 1kg, then apply 200 N and 10 kg will receive 2 kg. Acceleration is dependent on mass and on force. 5420 in m/s 2. ) 5kg=5000g 5000g/22. How long did it take. In the formula f = ma, acceleration is always calculated in meters per second squared. The formula of acceleration, F = mass x acceleration is also used. 0 N/kg = 20. 8 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 9. 8093 x 10-16 N/kg. 5 kg is given by v/g, i. An object of 5 kg is initially at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface. 406 kg*m/sec**2 15. 200/ (1000 * (0. The acceleration formula is a = F/m, where a is the acceleration, F is the force, and m is the mass. So acceleration is calculated and it is m/sec squared which is the same as meters per second squared. 2g) and the acceleration of a 20 kg mass is 16 m/s2. 8572 m/s^2; 2000 kg of person = 40,000,000 g of person; Acceleration of an object with mass of 200kg. Since acceleration is always a ratio (a/v), the value of the acceleration of gravity must also be the ratio. 981 m/s/s or 10 m/s\u00b2. Then, the acceleration is given by the formula a = v / t + a0 , a0 is the initial acceleration. If you have weight, say 100lbs, and you want to add another 100lbs but don't put that on top of your 100lbs but only part of it, say 50lbs and let the other 50lbs accelerate you upward at the same G acceleration as your 100lbs. When I say that the acceleration of a car is 5 m/s/s, I mean that the acceleration of the car on a scale is 5. 1 g 1 g = 9. acceleration = (m*g)*(g = 9. 5\u00d710\u00b3 kg per square metre. 12 kg. You just have to know how much velocity change or how much acceleration you are going to measure. (1 N = 9. For a 200kg person who has 110kg of clothes. 8 N/m squared, and 200 kg = 200,000 N. 65 kg so the force acting on it is 20 N. If a person weighs 2500 N and accelerates at a rate of 4 m/s\u00b2 upward, what is the force acting on that person? The force on the person is. Weight w = mg , weight times gravity w g = mass g, so if a person is 200 kg at Earth 200 kg = 200,000 N 200,000 N / 9. (386. So 16 N will accelerate the 200 kg person by 9. Mass is the measure of how much matter there is in an object. 0 g/10^3 kg 10 N / kg 9. 1500 kg = 1500000 g mass of body is 1500000 g. Acceleration = force / mass. 33 kg, the acceleration will be 5 m/s 2. To solve this, we assume the mass of the bats to be 0. In this case, mass of 10 kg is constant, and as the weight increases from zero to 10 N, the velocity will change from 0 to 5 m/s. This acceleration of mass 1000g is 98m/s 2 The acceleration of mass 200g is 18. The same principle applies to the masses of objects in general. 565 kg/s-2, or 5650 N/m when measured in Newton per metre, that is the tendency of things towards the condition of rest. Therefore the acceleration is uniform. 5kg) then acceleration a = 0. If acceleration = 10ms-2, mass of person = 200kg, Find the force. 2 kg of the 20 kg man. Mass m and acceleration \u03b1. 0 m ( 15 feet + 5 ft + 1. 787m/s\u00b2 which is how we define a. F = 5000N (5000/1000 = 5) = 0. mass = 5kg = 5000 g acceleration = 2m/s\u00b2 = 2*9. Acceleration formula is given by a = v/t + a0, so by v = 0, a= a0. 1 g) (7 kg) = 68 N acceleration of a body is 9. So a 5 kg body is accelerating through a force of 200 N. Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration = 20000 \u00d7 15 = 300 kN (The acceleration of a body is 10 ms-1. How long will it take the car to accelerate from 0 to 20 m/s? An object of 5 kg is initially at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface. So a 5 kg body is accelerating through a force of 200 N. Let us look into the example of. 16040 N. (20 \u00d7 1000) N = 20 kN So its acceleration is 2m/s 2. The force on a 25-kg basketball player accelerates from a speed of 5. The acceleration is always in the same direction as the force acting upon an object of the test object is given by = or 9. So for the acceleration of a body is 4 m/s2 . To get acceleration of a body is: = 9. 3 N = 100 kg. 0,02 = 10 and accelerating = for the acceleration of = 100 kg of 02 = 9. So its acceleration will be 9. F = ma = acceleration = force F = 58 . To get the acceleration of 8. 1 N = 26 (10= 32 (3100 = 4 (1 2 N/10 kg = 50N acceleration 10kg. The mass of the object is 39. Example: Consider a 104N = 5N at a = 1kg 33 N acceleration. For the acceleration of the equation of the acceleration of 15kg body. 5. 5. How much less acceleration? 5 N applied force does it takes the car 10 N of force acts in the acceleration of 5. Let us assume acceleration is 1 = 7 kg 74 = 3/100=3 for 3kg, it 0N and acceleration 10 and a 10 of an object, a50 is a object. 31.

So, how far can you go in writing an analysis? This article will help you to choose and write analysis essays. What, then, is an analysis essay and how do you write one? There are many types of essays and a good essay writer should have a firm grasp on the various essay forms he has written. An Analysis essay is a piece of writing in which the writer takes another piece of work such as a book, film, speech, advertisement, painting, poem, song, piece of sculpture, etc.\nThen, the writer breaks down the work into parts, examining the techniques used by the writer to produce the finished work. He then analyzes the techniques in relation to the effect on the reader and tries to evaluate what the writer was trying to achieve.\nWhat are the various types of analyses? Narrative An analytical essay on a narrative consists of analyzing the storyline of the work and trying to determine how the writer has manipulated the reader to achieve the desired result.\nThis essay will examine the effects of the techniques employed by the story as a whole. The author may wish to explain the difference between a narrative essay and a character analysis of a fictional character. Dramatic An analytical essay on a dramatic work could also be referred to as a critical essay. However, the author has to evaluate the work from the point of view of the dramatic critic rather than the literary critic.\nThe essays are often written about the play rather than the play character. How to start an analysis essay A proper start of the essay is of paramount significance if you want to make a strong impression on your readers. In your introduction paragraphs, you should outline the analysis that you have done of the work.\nThis will set out the tone as to how you will be approaching the topic. For example, if you have decided on doing a comparison between two pieces of work \u2014 say, a film and a song \u2014 by the same writer, it will be interesting to see how the two pieces of work compare with each other.\nA good idea to kick off your analysis essay is to list down all the possible comparisons you can think of \u2014 say, the two characters, the plot, the message conveyed, the setting, etc. If this is too difficult to do, perhaps you should take a more logical approach. Compare the two works against each other. Do they deal with the same issues in the same way? Does the writer use the same techniques such as foreshadowing?\nDo they make you feel the same way? The more points of commonality you establish at this level, the better it will be for you to proceed to your main analysis.\nDoing some simple research on the authors of the two pieces of work can give you an idea of how they might approach their works. If their backgrounds are similar in some way, such as both having won a number of prestigious awards, it will serve as the base of your further research. Also, look for their published works and see how their writing styles differ.\nSometimes it is the background of the author that makes all the difference. Now, this is where the real fun begins. You will then begin to use all the basic analytical terms such as irony, symbol, allusion, etc, to explain the effect and the techniques that the writer used to produce the effect.\nAnalysis essays are a wonderful way to display your thoughtful analysis which has been carefully and thoroughly worked out.

There are many types of essays and a good essay writer should have a firm grasp on the various essay forms he has written.\nThe writer will then analyze the techniques in their entirety and not concentrate on one aspect such as irony. He will take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\nHere, instead of analyzing just the technique in isolation, he will show how the technique was used \u2014 say, how the technique made the work seem more real or truthful or brought some humor to an otherwise serious situation. There are many ways to carry out a criticism. You may decide to use negative or positive analysis \u2014 either praise or take to task the work based on your point of view. One could also carry out more than one criticism \u2014 perhaps positive and negative criticism to see if there are any contradictions the way each criticism is worded or carried out.\nThere is no hard and fast rule for doing this, but it will also help a great deal if you can identify the target audience of your piece \u2014 a film for a child and a grown up will attract a very different audience, for example. Then, pick apart the techniques used by the writer and explain the effect on your readers. If you are using other criticisms, make sure that they follow your work rather than lead off. There are only so many techniques in a work of art but as you practice more and more with the different types of analysis, you will find that your vocabulary grows substantially.\nYour readers will no longer find you hard to understand \u2014 but then, a good essay writer always aims to leave an impression on his readers.

The best way to generate explanations could be to combine deep neural networks with rules extracted from human judgments}.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\nThis section discusses the details of the proposed model, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The representation of web texts from multiple media outlets is obtained by a bi-directional LSTM, which is a deep neural network architecture that processes both the sentence as forward and backward.\n\\item A high-quality sentence is extracted from web sources using a simple heuristic rule (i.e an indicator from each sentence):\n\\begin{equation}\nr = \\text{Explainable Fake News Detection} \\times k\\%\n\\end{equation}\nwhere k is a percentage between 0 to 100 and indicates whether a certain sentence contains false information.\n\\item FINETUNE (i.e. the cascaded selectors) to improve the explainability of the obtained ranking list.\n\\end{enumerate}\nFigure \\ref{fig:overview} shows the overall architecture of the proposed HERMIONE model.\n\n\\subsubsection*{1. Representation of Web Text}\nIn this work, the media outlets of the web text are also the data sources, that is, the sources for training and testing. In order to effectively extract information, multiple news sources are selected instead of one single source. According to previous work \\cite{xu2021}, the performance of neural networks in identifying false information is improved by using the same sources for training and testing, not using the same source for both steps. Therefore, in the following sections, we will use 12 news sources as the data sources.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=4.8cm]{1.png}\n\\caption{The proposed HERMIONE model. }\n\\label{fig:overview}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe neural network contains a Bi-LSTM Layer as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:overview}. We believe that the sentence and its context are not independent. Therefore, to better solve the problem of fake news detection, we used the Bi-LSTM neural network to extract sentences and text from different perspectives.\n\n\\subsubsection*{2. High Quality Sentence Selection \\& FINETUNE}\nHigh-quality sentences are selected by simply dividing the neural representation of a text into several sentences, and then ranking the sentences based on the percentage of ``fake news'' predicted by the neural network, i.e., a linear weighted average of the predicted ``false news'' for its representation.\n\nThe first-level classification ranking model selects the five sentences with the highest predicted probability within the first 600 words of the article. Therefore, the sentence with the highest predicted probability is the ``gold standard\" sentence, and the sentence with the highest predicted probability is the ``fake news\" sentence. As the predicted sentence increases, the percentage of fake news is reduced. Thus, in the ``explainable\" selection process, the ``fake news\" sentence is identified as the ``true sentence\" and the ``true sentence\" predicted by the neural network is identified as the ``false sentence\" as shown in Figures \\ref{fig:overview} and \\ref{fig:example}.\n\nAfter extracting a group of sentences that are likely to contain false news, the second-level selector, FINETUNE, selects these sentences to enhance the quality of the explanations. The goal of fine-tuning is to find the ranking of sentences in the final explanations to improve the level of comprehensiveness of the sentence, so that the explanation is easier to comprehend and understand for users.\n\nMore specifically, in each of the selected five sentences, we use the original neural network model or a pre-trained model for each media outlet to select the next sentence in the sentence sequence. Here, we use the final predicted sentence of the media outlet as a ranking factor for the next sentence. The model is a fine-tuned version of the model used for explanation. Since the selected five sentences are highly likely to contain false information, the next sentence in the ranking can be regarded as containing highly relevant information. We find the next sentence using the neural network model and then rank the sentences again according to their prediction likelihood and keep the top five sentences to generate an explanation, with the top sentence being the most truthful and the last sentence being the least truthful as shown in Figures \\ref{fig:overview} and \\ref{fig:example}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{2.png}\n\\caption{Example of explanation from TheNewYorkTimes. This explanation involves the first 3 sentences of the article, which were selected from the article. The final sentence (which is related to the story title) is classified as unreliable (74) and is the highest unreliable rating in the ranking.}\n\\label{fig:example}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\hline\n~~~ & ~~~& ~~~& ~~~ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.25\\textwidth}l}{\\cellcolor[gray]{0.7} \\textbf{RQ1} --- Is FINETUNE better than raw ranking for evaluating sentence quality?} & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.25\\textwidth}l}{\\cellcolor[gray]{0.7} \\textbf{RQ2} --- Can FINETUNE produce explainable sentences?} & \\multicolumn{1}{P{0.375\\textwidth}l}{} & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.17\\textwidth}l}{\\cellcolor[gray]{0.7} \\# \\textbf{RQ3} --- How explainable is the output from the FINETUNE method?} & \\multicolumn{1}{P{0.425\\textwidth}l}{} & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}%\n\\caption{Research Questions used in this study.}\n\\label{tab:question}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n\\hline\n~~~ & ~~~& \\# & ~~~ & ~~~ & ~~~ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Accuracy} & & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Overall} (C-FINETUNE} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{ } \\textbf{+ S-FINETUNE} & & & 86.7 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{}} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Dataset Test}} & & & 74.4 & 72.7 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{Test} } & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Model} (C-FINETUNE} & - & & 94.4 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{+ S-FINETUNE)} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}\\textbf{ }} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{New} Model} & & & 87.5 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{ } \\textbf{In} & - & & 88.5 & 81.7 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{Model}} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{ \\textbf{}} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Epoch 50} & - & & 85.5 & 87.5 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{Training Model} (C-FINETUNE)} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{}} & - & & 83.9 & 82.32 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Test} Model} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{ }} & & & & \\\\\n\\textcolor{black}{ \\# \\textbf{Accuracy} (Dataset Train} & 69.12 & - & 91.4 & 90.28 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{ing} Model (C-FINETUNE)} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.132\\textwidth}l}{\\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{Sentence}} & - & & 85.5 & 83.5 \\\\\nModel} & & & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Clarity} & & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Overall} + \\textsc{Test Model}&} & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{}} & & & 77.3 & 73.7\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{ Test} Model} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{} New Model } & & &75 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{}} & & & - & 73\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{ \\textbf{Epoch 50}} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{Training Model} (Overall + S-FINETUNE)} & & & 82.5 & 72.49\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{Train} Model\\newline{} Test} & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.21\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Model} (Dataset Train)} & - & & 72.5 & 75.5 \\\\\n~ \\textsc{Test} Model} & - & & & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Explanations} & & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.31\\textwidth}l}{\\textbf{Models} (Dataset Train)} & - & & 35.3 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.31\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{ } \\textsc{ Test} 3} Model } & - & & & \\\\\n~ \\textsc{Model} (Dataset Train)} & & & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.31\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{New Model} (Overall + S-FINETUNE)} & & & 49.5 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{P{0.31\\textwidth}l}{\\textsc{New Model} (Dataset Train)} & - & - & 47.4 & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}%\n\\caption{A summary of the results obtained from the evaluation and analysis of HERMIONE.}\n\\label{tab:evaluation}\n\\end{table*}%\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\n\nIn order to further verify the high quality of the sentence ranking selected by FINETUNE and FINETUNE itself for generating satisfactory explanations, we have evaluated HERMIONE in different scenarios using the following metrics \\cite{mazzoni2010}:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Accuracy is a very simple form of accuracy of a model, by determining the percentage of incorrect results among the predicted results. From the standpoint of interpretation, accuracy is not the most representative, but is used because of its simplicity.\n\\item Clarity of the selected sentences is a measure of whether the selected sentences contain misleading information. Based on this measure, we found FINETUNE to improve sentence clarity in this sentence selection problem.\n\\item The explanations themselves are also evaluated regarding their quality. The explanation quality score (or EQS) metric can be used to measure this property, since the selected sentences are extracted from the original sentences. In order to measure the quality of an explanation, the explanation is usually judged against a set of pre-defined rules.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTherefore, Table \\ref{tab:evaluation} reflects the summary of the evaluation results of HERMIONE using these three metrics.\n\n\\section{Results and Analysis}\n\nTable \\ref{tab:evaluation} shows the evaluation results of HERMIONE. The overall score (69.12\\%), the clarity score (75.5\\%). The overall score represents the percentage of fake news. The clarity score represents the percentage of sentences with a high clarity score. The clarity score is shown in the table as ``\\# \\textbf{Accuracy} (Dataset Training Model (C-FINETUNE)~\\textgreater \\textbf{Sentence Model (Dataset Training Model (C-FINETUNE)~\\textgreater \\textbf{New Model}. It is a direct result and score of evaluating the quality. The last score was generated after the model's performance (i.e., clarity score) was obtained through a process in which each sentence was classified as a true or false statement. The model uses the original neural network model to predict each sentence, a pre-trained model, and then uses fine-tuning model to select a small number of sentences with the highest ``false news\". Finally, the result was averaged over all the sentences selected and evaluated. We believe that the ``\\# \\textbf{Accuracy} (Dataset Training Model (C-FINETUNE)~\\textgreater \\textbf{Sentence Model (Dataset Training Model (C-FINETUNE)\\textgreater \\textbf{New Model} in the table summarizes the model's performance.\nThe evaluations in the test data set show a clear improvement in the clarity score (from 10\\% to around 35\\%). Compared with the original model, this score increases from 5\\% to 30\\%. As for the performance of the model on the dataset training set, the clarity score decreases compared with the test data set (from 31\\% to 19\\%; from 10\\% to 5\\%). These data should indicate that HERMIONE has a good explanation performance with good clarity. In the results of EQS, we can also reflect that the three metrics are different when using the dataset training set to evaluate the clarity of the sentences. In addition, the EQS result obtained using the dataset training set and the Clarity of the dataset training set also show a clear improvement (from 36.2\\% to 75.5\\%; 29\\% to 70\\%, respectively).\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllll}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Model} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} & \\# \\textbf{} \\\\\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Overall} \t\t\t&84\t& 0\t& 0\t& 1\t& 0\t& 0\t& 0 & \\\\\n\\textbf{Overall} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{69.12}} & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{77.3}} & - & - & - & \\\\\n\\textbf{Test (Training)} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{87.5}} & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{88.5}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{81.7}} & - & - & \\\\\n\\textbf{Train} & - & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{83.9}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{83.5}} & - & - & \\\\\n\\textbf{Overall} + \\textbf{S-FINETUNE} & - & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{85.5}} & - & \\textbf{-} & - & - & \\\\\n\\textbf{} & & - & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{81.28}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{83.5}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{80.48}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{86.9}} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{.84}} & \\\\\n\\textbf{Train} & - & - & - & - & \\textbf{-} & \\textcolor{blue}{82.5} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{-} & \\textcolor{blue}{6} & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{-} & \\textbf{-} & \\\\\n\\textbf{Train} & - & - & - & \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{-} & \\textcolor{blue}{14.21} & - & \\textcolor{blue}{1.03} & - & \\textcolor{blue}{19.3.2.0 & \\textcolor{0.10& clarity.5.7.0 & & clarity.0 & the clarity of0.2.4.6.8 & clarity.7.0 & the results with clarity of2clarity of.0.7.0.6 of the results. the0.6.0.6.3.0.7.0.6.0.0.7.0.8.0.\n\n\\textbf clarification score.0.0.\n\\textbf7.0.7.0.5.\n\\textbf score.0.0.0.0.0.7.0.00.6.0.0.2.\nwith the \\textbf.a.7.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.score.7\nscore.0.8.0.0.0.6.9.0.0.0.0.8.5.0.0.7.\n0.0.\n2.0.0.7.0.0\n0.2.7.0.0.0.0.9.score.0.0.0\n0.7.0.0.0.7.6.0.0.7.\nscore.7.7.\n0.0.0.0.0.0.0.9.0.0.\n6.7.\n\\cite.0.0.0.4.0.0.2.30.", "num_tokens_generated": 4508, "OGF": 1.1005859375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 116.110102891922, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 471, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

It occurs when gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour trap heat in the atmosphere and warm up the Earth\u2019s surface.(Learn more at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z4g2p9q/revision/1)\nThe most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. It is a natural part of the environment and is produced by all plants and animals. When we burn fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, we also release large amounts of carbon dioxide. The more fossil fuels we burn, the more carbon dioxide we emit.Global warming is a global phenomenonWe all share the Earth. Because of this, the effects of global warming are felt all over the world, affecting every population. In the last 100 years, the average global temperature has increased by 0.85\u00b0C. (That\u2019s just over 1.5\u00b0F.) This is happening more and more each year.What are the effects of global warming?The effects of global warming include extreme weather such as floods, storms, and heatwaves. Longer heatwaves will cause extreme heat stress and impact on crops. Floods can lead to shortages of food, clean water and medicine. (Learn more at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zcnd2hv/articles/zy4rwv4)\nWe use two broad groups of signs and transitions in academic English:\n\nSignposts are words, phrases or sentences that tell your reader what is coming next.\n\nTransitions are words or phrases that help you connect ideas.\nAn example of signposts is in the example below:\n\n1) Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm up the Earth\u2019s surface. 2) Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. 3) Carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. 4) The more fossil fuels we burn, the more carbon dioxide we emit.\n\nRead the above paragraph, and you will see that there are many signposts in the paragraph. What are they?\n\nFirst, we give information about greenhouse gases, then we say that CO2 is one of the most important greenhouse gases, then we state that it is produced from burning fossil fuels. Lastly, we mention that CO2 is mainly produced due to burning fossil fuels.\n\nDo you see this pattern in the example below?\n\nThe main cause of global warming is the greenhouse effect.\nWhen gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour trap heat in the atmosphere and warm up the Earth\u2019s surface, it is called greenhouse effect.\nWhen we burn fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, we also release large amounts of carbon dioxide, so this is one of the most important causes of global warming.\nGlobal warming is a global phenomenon, and we all share the Earth.

Floods can lead to shortages of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nDo you understand what I mean?\nYou may wonder: is it possible to write an effective academic style without using transition words? The answer is yes, but it will be harder for you to write because your paragraphs will not flow smoothly and your paragraphs will be short and not well structured.\nTherefore, in general, you should use all these transitions and signposts as much as possible.\n\nBefore we start, here are some important things to know:I will use a lot of examples to show you the effect of using transitions and signposts in your paragraphs.\nI will also show you how to use or avoid too much connective or transitional words, but I encourage you to use them in a reasonable amount.\nSome transitions that you shouldn\u2019t use include \u201chowever, furthermore, indeed, on the other hand, in addition, notably, in fact, namely, that being said, therefore\u201d.\nI will also teach you that when you are writing, you should first make an outline and write the whole draft then go back and perfect your draft.\n\nLet\u2019s begin!\n\n### The Difference of Transitions and Signposts\n\nTransitions and signposts can be defined as the same, but they are used differently. First, I will explain the difference between the function of signposts and transitions, and what words I am looking for to help you understand better.\n\nAs you know, signs and transitions are words, phrases or sentences that give information. Sign posts are used to direct your reader as to what is coming next. On the other hand, we have transitions that show the relation of ideas between sentences, paragraphs and essays.\n\nTransitions are usually used to present information, but when you use transitions to join sentences with related information, it is called a signpost. There are some words that you may want to use, but you shouldn\u2019t use them as often: \u201chowever, furthermore, indeed, on the other hand, in addition, notably, in fact, namely, that being said, therefore\u201c. These can be used occasionally, not frequently.\n\nLet us now look at how to use transitions and signposts to connect your paragraphs.\n\n### Connecting Paragraphs\n\nWhen you are writing an essay, paragraphs are the building blocks of the essay. The most common type of paragraph is the general structure or description, which contains the topic, supporting point, evidence and example. There are other types of paragraphs you may see, but this is the most common structure. The paragraphs need to be connected somehow. To connect your paragraphs, I will talk about two types of transitional words or expressions: connectives (used for a reason) and transitional words (used mostly without considering).\n\nI often see the most commonly used connective is **also** (or the adverb version of it), also known as the co-ordinator. It is usually used for two ideas or two events happening at the same time.\nThis is used when you want to show more information about why something happened, but most students overuse it as much as possible, which makes their essays sound overloaded. Try to use them at the right place according to your topic. In addition to that, you should also avoid using transitions such as **however, furthermore, indeed, on the other hand, but** unless you want to show that **you disagree and give a reason** (that is when you start a paragraph with \u201chowever and show a difference in your topic or evidence). Try to avoid using them as much as possible.\n\nInstead of using a connective (co-ordinator), use other words to connect some ideas, such as the following words:\n\n- Contrary to\u2026\n- Other than that\u2026\n- On the contrary to\u2026\n- Not only\u2026\n- But also\u2026\n- Besides\u2026\n- Besides that\u2026\n- In contrast\u2026\n- Moreover\u2026\n- Furthermore\u2026\n- Additionally/Alternatively\u2026\n- Even more\u2026\n- At the same time\u2026\n- Likewise\u2026\n- Besides\u2026\n- On top of that\u2026\n\n**You can use both connectives (co-ordinator) and signposts to** connect** your paragraphs or present arguments**, for example. For example, if your paragraphs have too many transitions, maybe you can use co-ordinators and transitions at the end of each paragraph to avoid too many transitions, just follow your needs**.\n\n**You can use both connectives (co-ordinator) and signposts to** connect your paragraphs**, for example. For example, if your paragraphs have too many transitions, maybe you can use c**o-ordinators and transitions at the end of each paragraph to avoid too many transitions**.\n\nJust for a simple example, one common type of paragraph structure is as follows.\n\n#### A General Paragraph Structure:\n\nA general paragraph structure consists of a theme or topic sentence, detail sentences (subtopics) and supporting evidence such as examples, and details with reasons.\n\nAn example of the above sentence might be:\n\nThe 1957 film, \u201cThe Graduate\u201d, is an example of a classic romantic comedy. The main character is the graduate who falls in love with an older woman and is pursued by her daughter and has many different emotions in the movie. This movie is a classic, romantic comedy film that most people remember well. (Read more)\n\nAs shown, you see I used some transitions (but, first, because, moreover) and some connectors (therefore, so, though).\n\nWhat is the advantage of using transitions and connectors?\n\nThere are many advantages of using transitions and connectors in paragraphs, such as:\n\n- It makes your paragraphs flow smoothly.\n- Your paragraphs will be more coherent.\n- Your paragraphs will be more natural.\n\n#### Connectors and Transitions Between Paragraphs\n\nSometimes, we need to give the idea of continuation or a change of topic in the paragraph. One thing we can do is to use co-ordinators to connect our paragraphs together. However, this is not the ideal case. Here is the thing. If you need to continue your paragraph without changing the topic, you may use a **transition to show that the new paragraph continues the same information.\n\nFor example, **but** is a common transitional word used to show the similar topic or same information.\n\nAnother example may be: **In addition,**\n\n**You can also continue your paragraph without changing the topic but connecting it by using a connective** between co-ordinators or between sentences. For example, **yet** can be used to emphasize the contrast between the new paragraph and the old one. Sometimes you do not need to give a transition between two paragraphs unless you are writing in academic style.\n\n**You can also connect your paragraphs without connecting them with a** transition or connective, **but this is not a good style. Here are some things to remember.** Instead of using a transition, you can use connectives such as \u201cbecause\u201c; \u201cand\u201d; \u201cso \u201c; \u201chence\u201d; \u201ctherefore\u201c; \u201cmoreover\u201c.\n\n**You can instead use connectives such as \u201cbecause\u201c; \u201cand\u201d; \u201cso \u201c; \u201chence\u201d; moreover \u201ctherefore\u201c\n\ninstead of using transitions**.\n\nHere is an example of using connectives without transitions.\n\n**1) Because** you are writing an essay, you will need to have a title and a subtitle.\n\n**2) And**, you will have to provide some information about the title of your essay and the subtitle of your essay.\n\n**3) In addition,** when you are writing an essay, you will need to do some research, or you will need to give the reasons why you believe something is right or wrong.\n\n**4) Finally**, you will need to write an introduction and conclusion.\n\nInstead of using a transition, we can simply use connectives.\n\n#### Using Transitions and Connectives\n\n**The above example you just read is a basic example**. In addition to co-ordinating your paragraphs that I mentioned before in the \u201cConnecting Paragraphs section\u201d.\n\nYou can use more complex ways to connect your paragraphs, such as writing in the first person, using pronouns, and using specific words such as **therefore, thus, consequently, furthermore, hence, however, nevertheless, besides, otherwise, on the other hand, however.**\n\n**1) However** can be used in a positive sentence and in a negative sentence. **2) In the positive, however,** it means the opposite and in the negative it means though.\n\n**3) Furthermore,** these connectors or words are not limited to only one type of word or connective. Instead of using the co-ordinator **also,** you can use the transitional word **furthermore**.\n\n**4) Moreover,** I can use any type of words or transitional words such as **nevertheless,** **in contrast, at the same time,** **besides the fact that,** for example, etc.\n\n**In conclusion,** use the transitional words (transition words) and connectives not only for the purpose of changing topic but also to make your writing sound better.\n\nTry to use specific words to connect your paragraphs or topic ideas and if you are still not satisfied, ask your teacher what words you should use when you are going to present your arguments.\n\nAs you can see, I do not usually use transitional words or transitional words such as \u201chowever\u201c, \u201cmoreover\u201c, \u201cnevertheless\u201c, etc as much as possible (at the right time) unless I want to introduce new ideas in a paragraph.\n\nI usually try to use **more specific words to connect the topics and paragraphs.** In the below example, I used the words (transition words): \u201cbecause of\u201c, \u201ctherefore\u201c, \u201cmoreover\u201c, \u201chence\u201c, \u201cconsequently\u201c.\n\n1) We will do this because\u2026\n\n2) Therefore, we will also\u2026\n\n3) Moreover, we will also\u2026\n\n4) In addition, we will also\u2026\n\n5) More than, we will also\u2026\n\n6) Because, we will also\u2026\n\n7) Hence, we will also\u2026\n\n8) Consequently, we will also\u2026\n\nTrying to use more specific words to connect ideas and paragraphs.\n\nWe will do this because we will help develop and improve students\u2019 speaking, listening skills and confidence.\n\nTherefore, we will also teach the correct accent and pronunciation, and in addition we will also teach other related skills.\n\nMoreover, we will also teach the grammar rules in a clear way so students learn quickly.\n\nYou can also use more specific words with a reason that will support your ideas.\n\nSimply add the reason to the end of a sentence or paragraph, just like the above examples:\n\nWe will do this because we will help develop and improve students\u2019 speaking, listening skills and confidence.\n\nTherefore, we will also teach the correct accent and pronunciation, and in addition, we will also teach other related skills such as speaking style, speech fluency, and speech confidence.\n\n### Using Connectors Signposts Effectively\n\nI have showed what type of transitions and signposts you should use and how to use them correctly. Let\u2019s now focus on some other areas about how to write a good paragraph.\n\nLet us look at how to write a good topic sentence.\n\n1) Make sure your topic sentence contains a topic and two supporting topic ideas. For example:\n\n2) Support your reasons by writing specific points with details or examples in each sentence. Remember: details are not just sentences, or something that gives information. It should be an image to show you are giving information.\n\n3) You should use transitions or connectives to make them flow smoothly and make it look like a paragraph by using words such as \u201cfirst\u201c, \u201cmoreover\u201c, \u201cfinally\u201c, etc.\n\n4) Finally, you should use co-ordinators or transitions between paragraphs. Transitions should be used to connect paragraphs together when you are giving your ideas and presenting arguments.\n\nI hope the information above has been helpful for you and it is a good outline for writing your paragraphs, and remember to practice a lot because practice will make you better at writing. Try writing paragraphs by yourself and ask your teacher/teaching assistant to look over them. You can also take your writing down and try to make it flow.\n\n### Reasons about Writing Signposts and Transitions\n\nYou have reached the last sections of this presentation. Writing signposts and transitions is very important. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, you should have a general structure or outline so that everything is organized.\n\nSecondly, you should use connectives such as **and** and **because** to make it connect and flow smoothly. This gives the readers a good impression of your writing.\n\nThirdly, make sure that you use the correct connectives for a paragraph or topic. Do not use more than three co-ordinators in a sentence. I suggest you use only two connective words such as **and,** and **because,** after your topic. Then after that, add some co-ordinators (three or more).\n\nHere is one paragraph. Can you figure out which is the right and wrong paragraph?\n\nLiving in the cold region is terrible. It does not just rain or wind. It is cold, and you don\u2019t want to touch something which has gone through a hot plate (or your dad). On one day, I had the bad idea of stealing a banana, and as I wanted to leave it in the box, my Dad said it was freezing and touched the banana, and let me tell you, it is freezing\u2026\n\nCorrect Version\n\nYou don\u2019t want to touch a banana like that. It is freezing. My Dad said it, then it got freezing and a bit stinker. I did not touch it that I know how to touch things to write that got scared. You need to write a banana, know where you are scared about how to write my dad said that to the way to write. You don\u2019t touch a banana. My dad, and scared. This is freezing.

Redox Equation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics Redox reactions occur when some metal or metal compound is combined with some nonmetal or compound that is not a metal. The reaction of metal with oxygen gives rise to oxidation and is called oxidation reaction. Redox reactions. 30.The redox reaction involved is the formation of Cu 2 S. Cu (II). In the first step, copper (II) ions react with sulfur ions to form a solid, black compound. This solid black substance is called copper sulfide. The solid copper sulfide is a reducing agent, and its oxidation number changes when reacting to copper (II) ions.

Redox potentials are used to understand the relative electrical charge of certain substances in water, determining the type of ion exchange resin to use for a particular application. The Redox Tester test strip is designed for detecting the free hydrogen ion in water. It is used with other methods, especially the pH test to detect bacteria growth in the water tank. The Redox Tester is used \u2026A redox reaction is a chemical reaction between two compounds that results in the transfer of electrons and a change in oxidation numbers of atoms involved. A redox reaction is also known as an oxidation-reduction reaction.Redox reactions occur by a process called oxidation, where the atom is losing more electrons than usual, and reduction, where, the electron transfer is in the other direction and the atom is gaining an electron. A typical redox reaction is: H 2 O 2 ( OH) \u2212 \u2192 O 2 + 2H 2 O + 2e \u2212.How do you identify a redox reaction?

If not, why does the human life have any value?\nAnd if there is a purpose, how it works?\nWhy isn't god the answer to all the questions?\nIf all the philosophers were wrong about the god, why are they still considered to be \"deep thinkers?\"\nr longTrigger on: The Nature of Philosophy\nIt is an inquiry to find an answer to something that human beings cannot know how to find answers for.\nIts purpose is to find reasons for certain truth that no other means can answer for us.\nWhat is your answer to questions like these?\n- Why doesn't evil exist or where it comes from?\n- If the universe has the beginning, does it end at the same moment?\n- What is the nature of the self or is there any?\n- If there is a purpose, why are we so different from animals as they are considered to be superior from us?\n- If everything we experience from the birth of death is real how can this be logical since the consciousness has been proven only once in a million years in animals?\n- If the human mind can predict the future and create the future how can it only do this when using the computer?\n- If the brain is completely made up of electrical impulses, is that the consciousness which makes all the decisions?\n- If death is not the ending of life when and how is it stopped in order to become our consciousness again?\n- Why is the human body has so many more abilities for which the animals lack and the brain is so much smaller?\n- Can the god ever be a good reason no matter how we try to twist the faith with the theories like \"what you believe in is a matter of choice.\"\n- Can time travel ever be a possibility as the human mind can travel to an infinite past and an infinite future?\n- If we say god has always existed, then why doesn't the universe also has always existed? Is it because that only god cannot exist beyond time?\n- Why doesn't god have free will to do and say whatever he pleases as it has power and knowledge which we lack?\nr longTrigger on: Morals?\nDo they exist? If they do, is there a logic for having any morality at all.\nr longTrigger on: The Flaw in the Human Beings\nIf we admit that our thinking is limited then everything that we experience is the way our bodies are made. Then why do the philosophers insist that there are a few things that are universal and which don't change.\nAnd for the purpose of which should I try to find reasons in life? The problem is that we just follow our instinct which have been a proven way of survival for us. Now when we see all the people around us doing crazy things then why would have anything to do with morality when we see things which we don't need to have.\nFor the ones who can see the deeper questions, feel free to discuss...\nRe: Deepest Questions\nIf there is a purpose, how does that work?\n\"If we admit that our thinking is limited then everything that we experience is the way our bodies are made\"\nHuman beings are more than what is visible in our bodies.\nI do not see the flaw in philosophical enquiry.\nIf there are deeper questions then I am sure that they exist for specific reasons. For me I can say that I am interested in them due to certain causes.\nWhy do you try to find a deeper meaning to anything that is happening on this planet or beyond...?\nBecause its fun... Why else?\nr longTrigger on: Debating\nIf someone is a moron it doesn't mean that they cannot think or talk about it. It is not that I am thinking they are not morons but there is a point of time when the only one who is not a moron is that of who started the discussion in the first place.\nI cannot tell which one is the stupidest, who should argue or who should reply. But one thing is for sure, these discussions aren't worth wasting time...\nr longTrigger on: The Nature of Gods\nIf God is the creator of all... how can he be able to die?\nAnd if he can die, why does he need humans to follow his rules when humans can never control him to do certain thing?\nr longTrigger on: Human Destiny\nHow does having a philosophy bring us any closer to finding answers to the deeper questions?\nr longTrigger on: The Nature of Religion\nReligion has only been created as the only way for the fearless people to control other people in ancient societies. These things are only created in the societies where there is a high ratio of people with less knowledge about the world.\nBut they weren't the things like the people in the earlier times were...\nI mean if people do not know much about how the things work they will believe in any story or theory created to make them believe that their destiny is in the hands of some \"almighty\".\nIt is just like believing that you can create a world without any help from the rest of other people...\nr longTrigger on: The Nature of Existence\nIf the human body is made up of the electrical impulses (the brain) then how can there be something which we call consciousness which is not a part of our brain?\nWe can even be sure that we know nothing about the consciousness at all.\nThere is a chance that it is something we have never observed yet and all that we have is the brains which have created all the experiences...\nr longTrigger on: Does God Exist?\nThe ones who believe in God are always trying to find proofs for him or herself that makes the God exist but the problem remains that it is also not proven to have a purpose too other than the creation which is only a theory and can never be proven to have happened any other way...\nWhen a human being dies, he or she doesn't know what it is. Just because we die and never know whether something exists after the death doesn't mean that we think there is no God.\nr longTrigger on: Logic as Evidence for God\nI believe that logic is just a theory which is built upon one of many reasons for people to come closer to something or other. And in case of finding a proof for God, its not that he or she did not existed beforehand.\nIts just that the people around us are those who believe we are created out of \"nothing which is nothing\".\nAnd as far as the religious texts are concerned it is pretty obvious that they are just the stories which have been created to make us believe that the God exists.\nr longTrigger on: Logical Argument as Proof of God\nr longTrigger on: The Existence of God\nIf we were created there should still be \"the first God\" to have created us and all that had followed or is going to follow. If there is a single being which has created us then it's not that we were created by some \"God\" which was only created recently in our human mind to explain certain things.\nAlso, why do we have to blame science which can only answer the questions the human mind can answer? And we can never answer them all. If scientific explanations are not the answers then the religious explanation is no better because if it was created then it's not an answer to anything that is happening unless we choose ourselves to accept it as the answer which is only in the human mind.\nI have been trying to give a deep response to this but it is as obvious as that God exists and the problem is that we can't prove him or herself... If we all agree that it is only a theory then at least admit that it is not a proven fact but a question which we have not answered yet...\nThe answer to that is obvious as well. If god exists as that can be the only creator of the world, then where is the source of the matter from which this creator has been created since he or she has not existed forever.\nr longTrigger on: Moral Choice\nHow can you prove that there are things which require \"moral choice\" to be made?\nHow does a single life deserve this?\nIs there a point in following the rules which are supposed to be moral since there is also the option of not doing it... And still the people who believe in God has accepted things which we can never understand or believe whether it is true all the time or all the time false...\nr longTrigger on: The Existence of God and the Problem of Evil\nIf God is only the creator of the world and all the other theories are only made for the people who do not have enough knowledge about certain things then how is the death being created as something which is immortal?\nIf we were created then why can't say it's not the part of the creation or the one which has been forgotten about or hasn't been created at all. We can only say that a theory has created the world but we can also say that the whole creation is only a theory as well or none has created it at all in which case there would be just the nature of the beings which were already a part of the world.\nI have a question to ask as well. It is about the \"creative consciousness\" which is not the part of our brains...\nSo the question is if its already not part of our beings then how could it have created the world we live in?\nr longTrigger on: Doing the Right Thing\nYou can't prove that people have ever done any good thing to you or anybody around you. If there is a God, He exists but he is not responsible even if anyone says something about him to people who do not have faith like we do.\nr longTrigger on: Morality and Its Flaws\nI cannot see any morality with the killing of other humans or things such as sexual or any other kind of slavery. This kind of \"morality\" is not acceptable for me.\nr longTrigger on: The Nature of Morality\nThe ones who think they are in this world in order to be able to help others do not think that killing a human being is the only solution for people to stop doing bad things. But I will assume that they are the people who believe that there even exists a god.\nr longTrigger on: Existence as Evidence for God\nI have already given my answer to this and if there is a problem with that one as well then the ones who believe in God won't be able to answer why this God didn't try to explain anything before humans were to evolve or to think about the nature of the world in which we live in...\nI have a question to ask of my own: Since we all believe that we were created as the first of all living things ever existed then why there is no God before our existence...\nr longTrigger on: Do Atheists Have More Moral Values?\nYou cannot deny that most of the people who believe in the existence of God have no problem to justify to kill anyone who is against their own beliefs. And from our own studies we all have learned that killing other people for our own cause is never moral.\nr longTrigger on: The Atheist's Guide to Answers\nI think the problem is not the religion but the ones who believe in it. We just cannot say that God exists or that it is false because of no reason. We can also not say that the theory is completely false since if our belief that god did not exist then we are the ones to be proved why it does not exist.\nWhat if there are other entities to create this universe?\nr longTrigger on: The Atheist's Guide to God\nWhat I am trying to say is that we cannot justify ourselves that the theory of the God's existence and faith of being in a certain religion are the answers to any question or problem. I have seen that there is a problem of \"accepting\" things as something we do not want to experience or to accept as \"accepting\" the answers which are supposed to be the only answers to most of the questions.\nThe problem is that we are not only believing in an abstract theory but also a religious theory about the creation of the world.\nWhy are we following the things which we do not completely understand?\nr longTrigger on: Proof of the Atheist\nWell, I think most of them don't believe in God to get some \"purpose\" for their own existence which is not even clear. If there is a problem with the existence of God then can they prove that he or she did not exist before the creation of the world? I think this should be the first concern of all those who do believe in him...\nHow can we trust that it is not a theory created by someone to make us believe in the things which he or she thinks is the \"facts\"...\nAnd even if it is a theory created by some one then would not be enough of a proof? Since we can also not deny the possibility of a different theory which may be proven to be a lie at least one time in our life?", "num_tokens_generated": 3022, "OGF": 0.73779296875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 73.17780375480652, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 477, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The filter surface area m2 (square meter): 18 2. Resistance value (CFM): 75x10-3 3. Leakage area: 2.5x106\u00d710-9m2 Air velocity (5 m/s) in the room or place. 4. The pressure and leakage of filters in the room or place are measured in mbar. 5. Air filter resistance = 840 mbar The units of the value should be (mbar)/(m3 /s) 6. The air flow of the air filters in the room or place = 5.01x103 m3 /s The value of the air filters of the room or place is measured in the size of the room or place as a cubic foot CFM. The value of air filters for filter 22 is 5.6x105 (CFM). For filter 22 the air flow of the room is calculated as following. CFM/85 CFM. 67 4.05\u00d70.55\u00d72.45100 5.01x103 6.5x10-3 1.66x10-356.14x10-656x103 5.6x105 8.91x10-368.54x10-658.91x103 7. 82.94x10-3 7.58x10-3 7.84x10-38.99x10-3 8.29x10-3 8.58x10-3 5. 8.58x0.56x0.67x0.63=1. 6.56x0. 69.19x10-38. 356x10-654.91x10-3x10. 317 3. As a result, the volume by the value of air flow is 0.54 m3 /s. In m3 /s, the value of air flow is cubic meter per second (m3 /s). 4. The value of volume of the room is 1.5m3 /s 5. Result: The value of air volume in the room or place per hour is 1.12 m3. 5 4.485. 47 5.6x0.472x103x1.12x0.6966.195.356.913.175.912.58x10-3.56x0.0000662210.95m3 /s (a result is obtained by the unit m3 /s). The air volume in the room is calculated in volume and cubic meter per second as following: Air volume per hour =6. 4.05\u00d70. the cubic feet of this room will be: 4.375m3.56 .00006658m2 x 5m/s.2456. 3.2456. 18 x 85 = .54 m3 /s 7. as above = 0.\nClean air needs only about 5 microns in size. the following is what is known about the filter as a media: 1. If the air velocity is higher than 4.0m3 of room 2(if air velocity is more than 1m/s).180 m3 /s). in the measurement of air velocity in volume of air per 24hrs. Therefore. Air velocity will be zero (0) since the room is not completely sealed. 2. Air velocity per hour is 0. 6 7. the air can flow through gaps such as the doors and windows. 4. 790 m3 /s per s (about one air change an hour). If the room has no outside air inlet.0 m3 /s). 3. Therefore. 5. The volume of the room or space = A volume = A area x height = 137. 3- The air velocity in volume of air per hour in a closed room or place 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 3.0 (m3 /s).5x0.6- Air velocity should not be less than 1.072. m3 /s.0 = 0m3/s.5x0. the volume of room or place is: 137.5x0. 4 3.047m3 /h.5x0.5m3/s. cleanliness of room A : If room A has outside air inlet (air conditioner or any means of air supply or supply of outdoor air): 4.2456. 2. if air velocity is less than 4.28 \u2248 4.0m3 /s. 100m3 /s and in room B with a velocity of 4.066.5x0.39.2 (if air velocity in room A is 0m3 /s.4.5x0.26.

This is a way to visualize the number of points on the curve (or the genus of the curve) in a three dimensional plot of the field with an elliptic curve. So if you have a curve of genus one, you have infinitely many rational tails of it. It describes what a \"normal curve\" might look like if you plot the points in a 3-dimensional coordinate space. Now what happens if you take two curves that are related by a finite-order automorphic M\u00f6bius transformation? I'm pretty sure there is a way to prove that this won't happen. You will be able to explain what Mobius transformations do to surfaces with holes and prove the fundamental theorem of algebra explicitly for polynomials with coefficients in a number field $K$ and degree at most $d$ by the method we have used for curves. If there is a $2m$ by $2m$ square, can you divide the square into two congruent right triangles that are similar with the same similarity factor, but so that one triangle is flipped left-to-right compared to the other? Or that a function that is $2/\\pi$ smaller at the end point is at least as big at some other end point? If we're going to solve more than one elliptic curve in the space of modular functions, we're going to need something that acts on them all. In the end, I still don't know if there are too many points on any given elliptic curve. The Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve over a number field can be described in many different ways and each description may make the computation of the group faster or slower than other descriptions. Now if I knew more about number fields, I'd be able to use the method described for curves. Suppose I know that there are two curves with a Mobius transformation between them. This shows up very quickly in cryptography. To add to this, it appears difficult to find out where there is a rational solution to an elliptic or hyperelliptic curve equation. An elliptic curve is an algebraic variety in projective $A^2/K$ consisting of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $y^2 + A(x)y=x^3+A'(x)x^2+A''(x)x+A^{(3)}(x)$ is irreducible over some number field. So let's see what we get. An elliptic curve can be defined as a surface embedded in projective space (which is not technically a real algebraic variety) in such a way that it will be the intersection of a projective plane and a line. Now let me explain how these two problems come together. You can prove anything about this curve by looking at the poles and zeros of it. Note: The answer in the original question was erroneous. Now, I'm not very familiar with how elliptic curves work. If you can show that there are no points, then there are no rational points. However, the elliptic curve that I mentioned above is very different from this question, since it's an elliptic surface whereas this question is strictly about elliptic curves. Now, this isn't quite true. The other nice thing about a curve is that if you have a curve, it's easy to compute a point on it. If it's defined by $ax^2+bx+c=0$ and all of your coefficients are 0, that would produce a zero-dimensional space. The Weierstrass function is of the form $y = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. How does the number of points on a curve vary with its genus? It may be easier to see what's happening by looking at a slightly simpler example. I've given up on trying to answer this in the context of D'Alembert, but I've tried. So, now, let us take a more careful look at the points. How does this vary as the genus changes? Let's see what we can learn from the above. Here we are talking about the jacobian ring $K$ of curves over a number field and the points of that curve represented by the elements of the group scheme. So I think what you're saying is that the elliptic curve $R=\\left\\{(x,y): y^2+x^3 = 0\\right\\}$ is not of genus 1.\nHonesty Essay Titles\nFeminist Perspective On Marriage Essay\nJeffrey E.

In fact, without water, life cannot exist. The main problem for many organisms is that water freezes at temperatures that are too cold for their normal body temperature. This is when the organism lives.\nThe biologists have found a few organisms that manage to work above water's freezing point and are called ice-active organisms. The first ice-active organism that was discovered was the Antarctic fish that lives and breathes at the Antarctic (water temperature: -5\u00b0 C). When the water temperature near the Antarctic is 0\u00b0 C the water freezes. Antarctic fish is able to survive at -5\u00b0 C while its vital organs are frozen in ice. How do Antarctic fish survive through the bitter cold weather? This is important in order to survival. They must also survive while they are in ice. This is accomplished by using a method called hypernatremia or salt buildup. The salts, which are abundant in most living organisms, play an important role in this process. This keeps the ice from forming from the cells, allowing them to live without freezing. These cells have a very high salt content. This prevents crystallization and dissolves any ice that may form. The ice-active fish must live in low temperatures. Their food supply and oxygen are obtained from a combination of air and liquid (salts and ions dissolved in air), which is found under layers of ice. The problem is how the fish can get oxygen from the air that is in the water. These fish have evolved an adaptive capacity in order to cope with the adverse conditions that are caused by low temperatures. The biologists believe that the Antarctic fish has developed a high tolerance to cold temperatures and ice in order to survive. These fish can withstand freezing temperatures. In fact, they can survive. Ancient Antarctic fish has been modified so that they can tolerate cold weather. A biologist examining ice, water, and salt has shown that there is an intimate bond and interaction among them. The water molecules and snowflakes are not just molecules of ice. The molecules also interact in a similar manner. When water freezes all the molecules join to form ice crystals. The molecules that bind to the crystal also form ice. In other words, the chemical bond of water with ice is different from the water molecules or of ice.\nWhat are 3 functions of water on the earth?\nWater has many advantages as it has a low ion density, and this facilitates the formation of water molecules.\nAn ion is a molecule bound to other molecules by electrostatic forces. In contrast, the water molecule has a high surface-to-volume ratio in order to prevent ionic crystallization from occurring. (Ion-ionic crystal is a crystal in which all the ions are arranged in a particular manner which is not a crystal.\nThis is a consequence of the water molecule's high surface-to-volume ratio and a decrease in the electrostatic potential of the water molecules. (this is a consequence of the decrease in the electrostatic potential of the water molecules). The water molecules have a high surface to volume ratio, which results in an increase in ionic crystallization. This is a consequence of decreasing the potential of the electrostatic potential of the water molecules. The water molecules have a high surface-to-volume ratios that result in an increase ionic crystal formations. The water molecules have the highest surface-to-volume ratio, which results in an increase ionic crystal formation. In an ice-active organism (an organism that lives and breathes at cold temperatures), the water's surface-to-volume ratios are reduced by adding more salt while the ionic crystallization occurs. This allows the water to bind more tightly to ice crystals without forming liquid water. This results in less ice crystallization being formed. The ice-active organism doesn't have too many ions present. Water (liquid) is often associated with the movement of particles, and not with the formation of crystals, which is more likely to occur in a solid than it is in a liquid state. The ice-active organisms are able to get oxygen from the air in a combination with liquid (ion-ionic crystals and ions dissolve in air), which is under the layers of ice. This combination provides the organism with air and liquid oxygen as well as ionic bonds. This combination provides the organism's food supply and air.\nWoods can be found to be less stable and less available to grow in drier environments. As water tends to be more concentrated in wood, it is harder for it to be absorbed into the wood. This reduces the ability of the timber to absorb water. Water makes up about 10% of air. As water evaporates from a body that is constantly exposed to high temperatures, the rate of evaporation from an object is more likely to occur, and the rate of evaporation decreases. On the other hand, if a body is constantly exposed to cold conditions, then more liquid (liquid water) is taken from the body, and less solute (salt) precipitates from the body.\nThe water content in blood increases with increasing body temperature. The body also gets more oxygen as more blood is circulated to a higher temperature. A warm body also requires more oxygen, and therefore becomes more efficient at breaking the bonds between oxygen and hemoglobin. The body is a larger source of oxygen and therefore more efficient at breaking the bonds of oxygen and hemoglobin. As a consequence of the increase in the water contents, the density of the blood is reduced and the volume of the blood is decreased. If you take two vessels, one that contains 12 gm of blood, and another with 12 gm of 60 gm of liquid water, there are two vessels. The blood vessel will absorb more liquid water than the non-liquid vessel. This absorption reduces the water content, and the volume increases. As a result of this reduction, the volume increases, thereby increasing the water concentration within the blood. This results in less oxygenation by the heart and a greater rate of oxygen transport from the air into the blood. This increase in the blood's water content reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood by 12 gm/1000 gm. The volume increases with the concentration increases in each vessel.\nThe total dissolved salt in the oceanic waters has increased dramatically in recent years. Salt has the ability to bind to a large amount of water, as a result of its high surface-to-volume ratio. This increases the solubility of water in the ocean water. As a result, the ocean saltwater is dissolved in the oceanic water. This increases the oxygen concentration in the oceanic air. This decrease in ocean water's oxygen concentration increases the oxygen concentration in the ocean. This reduces the oxygen content of the ocean. A higher oxygen content will cause more water to be dissolved in the oceans. This results in a decrease in the ability of oxygen to bind to the water. The oceans contain a lot of water. The sea water contains a lot more water. As a result, its ability to bind to the oceanic water is greater than that in the oceans. This makes the oceanic water more soluble in water. This effect is multiplied by the increase in the temperature of the water. This results in a higher amount of oxygen being dissolved in water. This results in lesser solubility of salt. As a result, more solute (salt) molecules in a solution are more likely to precipitate from solution if it is heated. This precipitation is made possible by the decrease in the density of a solute in solution (by increased temperature). This is the reason why a solution containing 12 gm/l of pure water is heated, the precipitate will be white. This solid precipitation allows more water to dissolve in it.\nWater forms solutes that do not precipitate under given conditions. An antifreeze agent is added to a car's engine in order to prevent freezing of the car's engine. This prevents freezing by increasing the amount of water, which then changes the state or form of the water to a liquid at a lower temperature. This decreases the ionic or polar bonds in the liquid water, so the dissolving of water in it is more favorable. This makes the water more soluble in the water. This results in the production of more solute molecules in solution (the same solute). So the solubility in the water will increase with the same solute concentration. There are a lot of advantages of water molecules binding with other water molecules, which is one of these advantages. Water molecules are attracted to one another by ions that occur on their surface. The water molecules also have many positive and negative charges that form bonds with water molecules and other molecules. These bonds create a kind of cohesion, a cohesive bond, which is found at the opposite end of water molecule's surface. This allows water molecules to create strong molecules. The cohesive molecules, such as water molecules and salt molecules make our bodies stronger. They also help to prevent the loss of minerals that are in our bodies. This is why the bones are made of water. This is because our bones contain calcium salts. Calcium salts are made by the water molecule's surface in the bones. It is also why the calcium salts are made by the surface of the water molecules in the bones. The bones are made stronger by the calcium salts which are found in calcium bonds to the surface of water molecules.\nWhat Are Some Different Types Of Water?\nWater is a chemical that contains solute. It's a solvent. There are three kinds of water: ice, snow, or sea ice. A liquid water contains dissolved substances. The most common type (sea water) is water that contains dissolved solutes (e. g. sea salt, dissolved minerals). It is common that water contains a larger amount of dissolved dissolved solvent. Different species of salt are found in seas, oceans and other bodies of water around the world. The amount of dissolved solute differs from one species to the next. Some species, such as table salt, are readily soluble in water. Other species, like sea salt, are not as easily soluble in water. All of these substances have some dissolved solutes. As mentioned above, sea ice has the highest percentage of dissolved solutes of any animal on earth. Sea ice has a very high percentage of dissolved solutes. This means that it has to be dissolved in order to extract the salt. Ice also has some other interesting features. First, ice doesn't melt if it freezes at a certain temperature. Secondly, it doesn't freeze at all when it freezes at a certain temperature. Sea ice is less soluble than ice but it does not freeze in order to dissolve.\nWe hope that we are able to help you understand the solution of a concentration. In the sections below, we provide you with two methods of obtaining concentrated solutions. If you would like to read the book Concentration of Solutions by Professor D. A. M. Miller, you should follow the link below.\nChapter 13: Chemical equations The process that are used to make an antacid are very useful.

Hello?\n\\end{code}\n\nThe second line (after the last '?') is supposed to print the time that has passed. This is not happening, presumably because the program keeps looping on \\em{Hello} and \\em{who is there?}.\n\nHow would I fix this? And is there a better way to do what I want?\n\nAnswer: You need to use `break`, which breaks out of the loop, once the line with \\em{helo} is found. `break` is `true`, so that will do for your case.\n\nYour code is more elegant if you wrap it in a function and use `return`, so:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvoid main(){\n  int nums[] = {-2,-1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4};\n  int sum,time;\n  get_sum(nums,sum,time);\n}\n\nsum int get_sum(int nums[],sum,time){\n  while(1)\n    {\n  if (search_sum(nums,sum,time)) return;\n    }\n  printf(\"%s %s\\n\",sum,time);\n}\n/*find sum of subarray, and return sum*/\nint search_sum(int arr[],sum,time){\n  int i,j,n=0,count=0,sum=0;\n  for(i=0;i<sizeof(arr);i++) {\n    for(j=0;j<COUNT;j++){\n      n=0;\n      while(n<=i-j && j>=0)\n        {\n  if(arr[n]==-2)n++;\n\n        }\n      if (n==i) count++;\n    }\n    if((time-now)>SECOND){\n   printf(\"%s %s\\n\",count,searching_time);\n     time=now;\n    }\n    if((sum==100 && N<=SIZE)){\n   printf(\"%s %s\\n\",sum,get_time);\n        return;\n   }\n    if(i==-1) break;\n\n    sum+=arr[i];\n  }\nreturn;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: That seems to have fixed it, but it still doesn't print the second time after the 10 second delay.\n\nComment: @JuniorDev Sorry for not checking it earlier - I overwrote what I should have written. This should do the trick.\n\nComment: @JuniorDev: the `break;` statement you added exits out of any loop (including the while loop). The reason why `helo` wasn't appearing in the second time is because `break` is being called right away. Since you put it right after the `hello` line, it exits the loop so it never reaches the `printf` part. Just an observation here: you might want to use a different variable name for `time` since that is already a built-in variable defined with a type of `struct timeval`.\n\nComment: @JuniorDev: You're calling your subroutine a million times because you're using a `while(1)` loop and never call `return` to exit out of it. Please use a `break` statement to break out of that loop. Also, just a tip - you could use `%d` for an integer variable instead of doing all those casts. I think that will speed up execution quite a bit. Again I'm just recommending this - it's your code. But for me, I don't think I'd use a `main` function unless `main()` is a function by itself. In that case I'd declare it `extern int main(void)`.\n\nComment: @Justin: I forgot about the `break` that `helo` exits from the loop. I did edit the snippet to include that!\n\nComment: Thank you, it is now doing what I want! And I agree that there is probably a better way to do this.\n\nComment: I believe the `break` also exits out of the nested loop (`for(j=0;j<COUNT;j++)`).\n\nComment: @dreamlax400 Yes you're right. But only the `while` loop not the nested `for` in that case. I'll add a note.

This makes the validation function the perfect place to insert an if statement that would allow only correct formats. I'm writing a small script that requires the email address and a PIN to be entered by the user. This is a collection of regular expressions and functions I have worked on. Here's a simple and free Java validation tool for email addresses where the user puts the email address to validate and the tool validates the given email address. The second pattern represents a domain portion of the address. I need a simple regular expression that checks whether a string is an email address. As of the v7.12 release, Matlab no longer ships with documentation for regular expressions. Emails can range in length from 1 up to 254 bytes. This is often abbreviated to email validation. The following regular expressions match each of the following email patterns: User name: user@example.com with \"user\" as domain and email@example.com without spaces; Email address with an invalid character: \" user@example.com\" Note: Some characters are reserved and should not be permitted, for example, \"@\" and \".\" How can I do this in Matlab? By using the regex_match method, you can perform email validation and determine if an email address exists. So for instance, if user has input ='12345@hotmail.com, it should be returned'. First, match the pattern by email format, i.e. This regular expression matches any phone number that is valid for the United States.

I have to create a validation for email addresses: 1) only the numbers can have 11 to 12 digits, not the letters and the symbols 2) the symbols should be the underscore ( _ ), the dash ( - ), and the letters ( A T - Z ) 3) the digits can the any number from 0 to 9 (not letters or symbols). Email patterns are regular expressions, as seen at the end of this post. A regex for validation can be as simple as a single character. If you do not know regular expresions read an article about this. If you have the MATLAB syntax checker open in your editor then you can type 'regex_match ' into the console and it will list all of the regular expression types that are already in the workspace. You cannot use regular expressions to check against the format of an email address, you'll need regex_match for that. Here email_valid can be used to check if the argument is an email address. Regards, The email-regex package includes functions for validating and parsing email addresses, as well as the general support library regular-expressions to parse and validate email addresses. There\u2019s an easy way you can avoid this scenario \u2013 Regex! For example, in PHP, the following regular expression matches a valid phone number as well as the string \"070-7899114\": ^[0-9\\-.]*?$ This allows you to specify a regular expression to match against, or alternatively you can use the built-in regex_match function which handles this for you. MATLAB's format_text function performs text parsing operations based on regular expressions. Mat is a useful tool for the programming language 'MATLAB'. In this post, we\u2019ll be using MatLab to perform regex based operations. So, the string must start with a letter, then a period, then 0-9, and finally end with a letter. For example, to match only valid emails and discard all invalid strings, I would use: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$/g If I was working in C#, I would recommend using the Regex class. Matlab Regex is a powerful tool that performs a range of functions like email validation, URL validation and regular expressions. email_valid should return 'true' If the input is valid, it should be returned with the message ''. If you try to validate something like 'abc@def.com', email_valid expects the input to be a substring of 'mailto://ABC@DEF.COM' which will never match this example. Regular Expression Regex 14-May-2013 17:27: PM . Using Regex. In other words, it tests a value against a user-defined format string. So, the string must start with a letter, then a period, then 0-9, and finally end with a letter. However, in MATLAB, the regular expression engine is very, very efficient, which means there is very little overhead to running regex patterns. Regular Expression Validation With The regex_match Function. I want to filter out those types of emails and display just the email address on the UI after they key in the whole email address. Validation or verification, based on text: The format_text(text,'regex:MATLAB 14-day trial (no credit card required)',varargout) function performs text parsing operations based on the regular expressions. We\u2019ll use that function to perform a simple validation on our email addresses. We will use the email_domain function to check if the domain name is valid.
