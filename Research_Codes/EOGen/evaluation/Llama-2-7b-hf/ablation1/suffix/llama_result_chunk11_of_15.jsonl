It is unclear what your definitions are, how the examples you give relate to the problem statement, etc.\n\nAnswer: You are looking for a \"contrary-to-fact\" conditional (C-to-F conditional).\n\nA, B, and D are \\em{trivially} true if $R$, while C is \\em{trivially} false (C is \\em{strongly} true, not just $true$, if $~$R$~$).\n\nI'll refer to the negation of each possibility as $R \\Rightarrow a^*$.\n\nWith that in mind, note that if $R\\Rightarrow a$, then $a^*\\Rightarrow a^*\\Rightarrow a$ (the conditional always holds), thus:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $R\\Rightarrow \\lnot a^*$.\n\\item $\\lnot R\\Rightarrow b_1^*$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHere we see these two statements are logically equivalent - \\em{every} proposition is true, or every proposition is false.  This is usually called the Law of Reverse Possibility, and is true when we are given contrary-to-fact conditions and we always assume the contrary-to-fact condition is true for our purposes.\n\nWe could make similar argument with the C-to-F conditional:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $R\\Rightarrow b_2^*$.\n\\item $b_1^*\\Rightarrow b_2^*$.\n\\item $ab_2^*$.\n\\item $R\\Rightarrow ab_2^*$.\n\\item $R$.\n\\item $\\lnot R\\Rightarrow ab_2^*$.\n\\item $a\\lor b_2^*$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe two statements are logically equivalent when we have the C-to-F conditional.\n\nIt's also possible to see this using De Morgan's Laws (if it's even relevant to your proof).  Given the $a^*$ terms, you can write:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $R\\Leftrightarrow \\lnot a^*$.\n\\item For all $b_i^*$, $R\\Leftrightarrow b_i^*$.\n\\item Therefore, $R\\Leftrightarrow \\lor a^*$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTo make something similar work for C-to-F, note that we have $a\\lor b$.  Then we see we can use the previous point to show we have the equivalence $a\\lor b\\Leftrightarrow R\\Leftrightarrow \\lor a\\lor \\lor b$.\n\nThen, it doesn't seem to matter which C-to-F conditional we use, because the statement $R$ is \\em{always} true for all the possibilities, we get these equivalences for all of them:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $R\\Leftrightarrow c_1^*$.\n\\item $R\\Leftrightarrow c_1^*\\lor \\lor c_2^*$\n\\item $l_1\\lor c_1^*\\lor c_2^*$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe can even replace the equivalent C-to-F statement after using the equivalence using De Morgan's Laws:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $R\\Leftrightarrow l_1$\n\\item $R\\Leftrightarrow \\lor l_1\\lor \\lor c_2^*$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer: You may have forgotten that B is the statement: if the grass is not wet, then it does not rain ?\nIt is obviously false in the usual English sense of the word \u201cif\u201d (i.e. not \u201cif and only if\u201d).\n\nOn the other hand, it is true in the logical sense: A implies B.\n\nA is (as you said) logically equivalent to the sentence If it rains , then the grass is wet.\nB is, on the same logic and in the opposite direction, logically equivalent to the sentence If it does not rain, then the grass is not wet.\n\nC is logically equivalent to the sentence If it does not rain, then the grass is not wet; but it is NOT equivalent to If it never rains (or even infrequently rains) , then the grass is never wet. C and D are NOT logically equivalent.\n\nNote that this is actually a specific case of the well known\n\nLaw of Reverse Implication.", "num_tokens_generated": 1232, "OGF": 0.30078125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 28.20826768875122, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 341, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

If you would like a list of dataframes then:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndf_list = pd.read_html('/tmp/example.html')\n\\end{code}\n\nwill produce this as \\strong{example} and \\strong{example2}, etc.\n\nA good way to test that you have the data types right is to pass the raw output into \\strong{json.loads}:\n\n\\begin{code}\njson.loads(df.to_json())\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will produce:\n\n\\begin{code}\n{'A2': '2020-09-27 18:39:55', 'A3': 'SMS', 'A4': 'AAA', 'A5': '10658139', 'B2': '2020-09-27 18:36:05', 'B3': 'SMS', 'B4': 'AAA', 'B5': '10658139'}\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: After a long time of searching, I find out I can handle this kind of file by using regular expressions to replace the specifics in each row of the html table.\n\nI have created a python script named convert_html_table.py to convert a table with columns like: x-str, SMS, AAA to this form of pandas dataframe (x-str, SMS, AAA).\n\n\\begin{code}\n    column_dict = {}\ndf = pd.read_html(table_content,engine=\"lxml\")\nresult_dict={}\nfor i in df.columns:\n    column_dict[i]= i\ncolumns = column_dict.keys()\n\nwith open (table_content, 'r') as line_reader:\n    for line in line_reader:\n        line = line.replace(r'\\sx\\:str=\"(.+)\\\">', r\">\\1\",line)\n        line = line.replace(r'\\sdata=\"(.+)\\\">', r\">\\1\",line)\n        if line == \"\":\n            continue\n        df1 = pd.read_html(line)\n        df2 = df1[columns]\n        df2 = df2.dropna(axis=0)\n        result_dict[columns[0]] = df2\n        result_dict[columns[0]] = result_dict[columns[0]].dropna(axis=0)\n\\end{code}\n\nNow I can get a pandas dataframe with columns like: x-str, SMS, AAA, 10658139.", "num_tokens_generated": 786, "OGF": 0.19189453125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 18.011679649353027, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 347, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

You have the `-O3` flag with `-fprofile-instr-Generate` and `-fprofile-force`. These can actually be used with any C++ compiler, but they are only really useful with gcc.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n`-O3` - Enable all optimization and run-time code generation features\nof the compiler to produce highly optimized code. The optimizations\nmay have a significant impact on size of the program. This is the\ndefault setting for both GCC and g++.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n`-fprofile-instr-Generate`\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n`-fprofile-instr-Generate` - Generate instructions to fill a profile data collection table. Profile instrumentation\nuses a table of function profiles and a call site sampling routine.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n`-fprofile-force`\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n`-fprofile-force` - Force profiling during link\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere is no \\begin{code}\n-f<something>\n\\end{code} flag with clang, but there are equivalent flags.\n\nYou can compile with `-O3 -g` and use `-fprofile-fatal-errors` from `gcc`, which will give better coverage. You might even be able to compile with `-O3 -fno-profile-use` or `--param profile-use=no`. If clang doesn't support this, try compiling with `-O3 -rdynamic` to see if that gives better coverage. The only other option with clang is `-fprofile-fatal-errors` like with gcc. [Both `gcc` and `clang` have the `optimization` and `debugging` sections in their manuals that document `f` flags that affect either option.](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/manual/binutils-2.35-man.html#binutils-2.35-man)\n\nIf you don't want to manually profile, then you can use the GCC profiling code to make `-rdynamic` with clang's `Clang++` tool instead of using `-fprofile-fatal-errors`. This is what `-lpg` (libprofgecko) actually does.\n\nAlso, be careful of using clang++ over plain clang because there have been bugs in the way clang behaves with the C++ language. [The clang++ implementation of C++ is a bit behind the rest of the front-end.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3855621/why-is-clang-not-as-fast-as-gcc)\n\nComment: I can't use `-fprofile-fatal-errors` because the problem is too big. So, is `-fprofile-force` going to help?\n\nComment: If it will make a difference is anybody's guess. A profiler cannot tell you how to make the program faster.\n\nComment: Yes, that would be the idea. It is going to tell me what is the bottleneck, so I can tell the computer to process it slower.\n\nComment: @S.Mirzoev I added some options to use on clang.\n\nComment: I am also wondering where is the bottleneck, whether it is CPU, RAM, or the way I process the data by calling library functions.\n\nComment: Doing that is what I was trying to get at. The profiler will tell you where you spend all your time, which you'll have to analyze to find out what you really should optimize.", "num_tokens_generated": 816, "OGF": 0.19921875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 18.727683782577515, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 348, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

You can see what I've done by comparing the \"original\" version with mine. Let me know if there's any problems with them.\n\nComment: Yes! This is just what I was looking for, and to be honest it's giving me trouble because I don't know how to use table. But I'll keep searching.\n\nComment: @JonNettle: Thanks, that was a great help.\n\nComment: Actually, ExcelToLinq worked for me. I just didn't know how to properly use it to suit my needs.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhen I do this:\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{code}\n  foreach (var data in ThatList)\n {\n     Console.WriteLine(data.Id + data.Name + data.Gender);\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI want the data to store in List<ExcelData> where\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThat sounds like a perfect job for LINQ. I don't remember if LINQ has an implicit cast to any type, but assuming it's possible you could do something like the following:\n\n\\begin{code}\nList<ExcelData> theData = package.Workbook.Worksheets[1]\n    .Tables[1]\n    .ToList()\n    .Select(t => new ExcelData()\n    {\n        Id = t.Row[0].Content.ToString()\n        Name = t.Row[1].Content.ToString(),\n        Gender = t.Row[2].Content.ToString()\n            }).ToList();\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nSo that I can call out the contents using the heading name.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIf you use the [SelectMany](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.selectmany) extension method you can do something like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nList<ExcelData> theData = package.Workbook.Worksheets[1]\n   .Tables[1]\n   .Rows\n   .SelectMany(i => i.Cells\n   .Where(i => i.Value == \"HeadingName\")\n   .Select(i => i.Cell[0].Content.ToString()))\n   .ToList();\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: @JonNettle I think you're correct! (I did a quick test and it's working). Can you please try inserting in the first of the two lines `var table = sheet.Tables.First();`.  That's the first one. You should probably remove that last \"ToList()\" as well since it's the same.\n\nComment: In the first example, when I insert `var table = sheet.Tables.First();`, I get this: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'Microsoft.Analysis.LINQ.Queryable<ExcelCellType>'\n\nComment: `I get this: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'System.Collections.IEnumerable'`.\n\nComment: Let's try this again. It looks like that first \"ToList()\" has to stay.\n\nComment: @JonNettle What about the first line?  I think you were doing something like `sheet.Tables...`.  But you should just do `package.Workbook.Worksheets[1]`.\n\nComment: Still get the same error: Cannot convert lambda expression to type System.Collections.IEnumerable\n\nComment: It looks like the same error is happening even if it's List<ExcelCellType>.  I don't know what the error is but I just tested it out on my machine.  You might need to ask someone else.\n\nComment: Also, you don't have to do 'package.Workbook.Worksheets[1]' if you have already declared your sheet.\n  var package = new ExcelPackage();\n  var sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets[1];\n\nComment: @JonNettle Are you running this is .net core?\n\nComment: I thought it was. It says Windows Application, so I am not sure. I also got this: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'Microsoft.Analysis.LINQ.Queryable<ExcelCellType>'\n\nComment: The problem appears to be one of enumerable types. If I do it like this: var myObjects = (from l in myList select l.Head as \"Value\") I get the error: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'System.Collections.IEnumerable'", "num_tokens_generated": 2832, "OGF": 0.69140625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 69.1784393787384, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 353, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

(1) Remove #include < iostream> this is a redundant include <iostream> is the only required include file and it will automatically include iostream as well. (2) Remove #using namespace std; I understand why you would want to include the std namespace, but this could cause trouble, especially in a class. As a beginner you should have no need to do this, unless the class you are learning to write is one that you have been given to write. (3) The argument list must be in order from one side of the assignment operator over to the other side of the assignment operator. You have y = b; before x = a. 4) You do not have to include ' \\n's like this. Just <, >, ' and ; are enough. 5) I would recommend you not use C style comments, unless you are copying this verbatim from a class you were given to copy.\nYou don't need to include two headers.

Why? Because C++ is a free-standing language with its own documentation tools like templates, comments will clutter with unnecessary data. You should follow the good practice of commenting code with the Doxygen Doxygen is a robust, open-source documentation tool that has many advantages over comments, including an automatically generated API documentation for your classes and functions, as well as a handy online web-based preview.\"\nYou are welcome.

I made the changes.\n#include < stdio > is redundant.\n@John.Houser , so do I have to use < stdio >?\nBTW, don't use commenting C style(/* ... */) because it is not recommended for C++ (using C and C++ as languages is not the same thing and should not be used the same way). See: Is use of // in code bad practice\nAlso, your code does not compile or run. Make sure you read the answer and the comments. :)\n@Sylvian . I know about C++ != C . But , I'm not following C++ coding conventions , like {} or ;. And I do what I do best\n@SylvainLeroux, @Steve, thanks for mentioning that as well :)\nI understand about conventions and so on. However it makes it more difficult for people to help you. So it's better to follow standards with comments too.\nYou're welcome! :)\n@Luis.Ramos_08 , thank you for your time. :)\nIncluding < is a better practice.\n@john.houser , sorry , I didn't get that.

It doesn\u2019t work if the argument\u2019s value is `undefined`.\n@JonPurdy Yes, but it doesn\u2019t do the same thing when it is an array.\n@JonathanLundell I know that, I'm saying it doesn't work when you provide a value for the argument\n@JuanMendes what kind of values did you provide to have this happened?\n\"let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\nlet sum = 0;\\nfor (let i in numbers) { sum += i; }\\nconsole.log(sum); // expected output: 15\"\nI tried this code (and variants like adding a number other than `for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) { sum += i; console.log(sum); }` ) and works only for primitive values\nThe value of `i` was `undefined` in one case, and `undefined` was returned to me but the loop terminated without executing the body.\n@JonathanLundell so I must redefine my question\nIs it possible to execute the body of the loop (not the loop) when the value of `i` is `undefined`?\nMy understanding would be that if an `undefined` is thrown into a `for...of` it means it should break out of the loop. But it sounds like the loop still continues. That is a weird use case scenario, because for the rest of cases this way of looping is useful.\n@JonathanLundell yes it is, and it's an edgecase when you are doing things like filtering by empty arrays\n@JonathanLundell yep. But I don\u2019t think the semantics of how `for...of` is used in this case is well understood by people, and I get people misusing it all the time. I mean I get it mixed with `Array.forEach()` all the time.\nI see, that makes sense. I don't suppose you have tried what @JuanMendes said?\nTry {for (let i in numbers)\n@JonathanLundell ok I'll try it later (I'm at work now)\n@LynnCroudace you\u2019re not gonna believe me but\u2026\nI know @JonathanLundell\n@JonathanLundell I\u2019m having a hard enough time trying to get my own head around this. lol\n@JonathanLundell yes I tried it and it works.\n@JonathanLundell that's interesting, I would have never guessed that\n@JuanMendes yeah when I saw the line of code I said \"no i would have never guessed either\" lol\nIt\u2019s weird, because I remember when I was learning it the first time there was actually a case where undefined was thrown out in a for loop\n@JonathanLundell I actually don't think that's right\n@LynnCroudace it may be wrong but it does work\n@JonathanLundell I'm having a hard time believing this in practice\n@JonathanLundell this doesn't quite work as expected. if 'foo' is an invalid type 'undefined' is being passed when it shouldn't. You should probably `typeof foo` first before continuing.\n@KevinB You can also use the debugger! (with a few precautions)\n@Justin Time to add to the list of things that JS developers use.\nThis doesn't work because an `undefined` is not always a valid type. That isn't what the loop is designed for. If it was it wouldn't have needed the `let` keywords.\n@KevinB yay console log\n@KevinB not working for me: C:\\>java hello World\n[INFO] Hello World\n[INFO] System.out.println: Hello World\nThat just shows you what it is supposed to do, not what I'm trying to do.\nI'll have to rebase this question then since I'll need some better clarification.\n@KevinB so can you change that to this?\n[INFO] Java World\n[INFO] Hello World\n[INFO] System.out.println: Java World\n@KevinB if you're trying to use that to log errors from the console, you'll probably want to do something like this: debugger;\n@KevinB yeah, I'm trying to get it all on console.log. I want to be able to log every error, too.\n@KevinB lol nooo.\n@JonathanLundell the code I gave you works though.\n@KevinB I'm using JSHint.\nThat could be something on your end.\n@Justin yep. But it doesn't tell me something's wrong. Like, the JSHint console on Stack Overflow.\n@JonathanLundell no, that code doesn't return an error.\nWhen I add an invalid variable it doesn't return an error.\nIt returns true though since my function returns the boolean value that the variable is not undefined.\n@Euphoric if you do the let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] test, does it show up in the console? If not you're probably using the wrong thing.\n@Justin you said you tried this: for (let i in numbers) { sum += i; } it returns the undefined value of i, no?\n@Justin the thing you need to do to get it to recognize invalid values in an if or else statement or whatever is this: switch (validValue) { // case not undefined: // case invalid: }\n@JonathanLundell You should add that as a comment to the answer.\nIs not undefined: console.log(i); // undefined\nIs invalid: console.log(i); // undefined\n@LynnCroudace I think you might have missed the point of what I was saying. I think everyone on this board is just missing what I'm trying to do.\n@LynnCroudace sorry, I don't understand what you're saying. Could you please break that into a different message and maybe an explanation for that particular message?\n@JonathanLundell he said \"returned to me\", meaning when the loop ends.\n@JonathanLundell ooooohhh! I see what you mean. I don't know if that would work.\n@KevinB If there are no errors in your code then it won't throw an error. JSHint just points out the issues in your code.\n@JonathanLundell well, I don't think it'd work even if it did throw an error for invalid values, the code would log 0. I think it must be the console that prevents the value.\nNo. There is no loop here. The loop is inside `for...of`.\n@KevinB Yeah. I think the console's there. I'm just not positive because I don't have a JavaScript compiler.\nSometimes in error testing I try to do `if (variable) { console.log(\"It's null!\") } else if (variable === undefined) { console.log(\"It's undefined!\") }` just to see if that works.\n@Justin so, I think I had a miscommunication. Let me rephrase: I'm trying to log every time the loop doesn't run. Whenever an `undefined, false, or null` value hits. Not when the loop ends normally.\n@KevinB you can use the debugger. `alert(foo.l);`\n@KevinB well I see what you're saying.. The console prevents it.\n@KevinB I think you should just make this post into a question\n\"Let me rephrase: I'm trying to log every time the loop doesn't run. Whenever an `undefined, false, or null` value hits. Not when the loop ends normally\"\nHonestly that's a pretty specific scenario. Also, it's possible to use a debugger.\n@JonathanLundell lol yeah, I don't have my VSCode or Chrome right now for that to work.\nI'm kinda on mobile right now.\n@KevinB what about chrome or whatever on desktop? Or even safari on desktop?\n@JonathanLundell oh no no no. On mobile I'm literally on a keyboard. lol I don't have a lot of apps right now.\n@KevinB oh ok. If you'd like I can try this in a code snippet for you...\n@Justin yeah, that's what I'm figuring out right now. I just need a place I can use the debugger to see if that's what I want to do. This is my third attempt to figure this out. I don't want to mess my project up until I figure out how to do this.\n@KevinB that works just fine. The main difference though between for..of and for(let x of {}) is that one is an iterator and the other is a generator. They're pretty much the difference between iteration and \"yield\". With generator function you're never guaranteed to return the data as it's being generated. That's why this is working.\n@KevinB oh yeah, I didn't even know that! Thank you!\nI'm just gonna add in the break for invalid so now I know it's gonna work. But I actually have to rewrite my code now because we never get the value in a for loop in JS because it's a foreach.\n@KevinB oh hey, you could also put a break after the first if, too: console.log(validValue === undefined); if (validValue === undefined) { break; }\n@KevinB that's not wrong though, that's a perfectly valid way to do it.\n@KevinB oh also, an error isn't always an error. Sometimes errors are just \"invalid values\".\nIf your code has an error, JavaScript will throw an error. If your code, however, is just invalid, then it behaves differently. You're using switch for that.\n@KevinB oh I see, that makes sense.\nLet me change this to a question.\nYes, but switch is only useful if the value is an error. When we return `true` or `false`, based on whether or not a variable is undefined, is that an \"error\"?\nI think I might know what Kevin was trying to do.\nIt's about logging the difference between for...of and for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) and they don't. They work exactly the same. That's why Kevin said \"I don't know if that would work\".\nThat's not a bug, it's a feature\nlol and it's also why he said \"if\" instead of \"do\".\n@KevinB it doesn't return the same as you would get from the array though.\nWe know, because he said \"I'm trying to log every time the loop doesn't run\"\nThe array is a perfect example of something where you don't need a loop anyway, because it's not changing when you iterate through it.\nI'd like to add to this post because I think maybe there's something weird going on in the console itself that causes the undefined-ness to get ignored.\n@KevinB well an array has a defined length. The for let, however, it's an infinite generator.\nSo there might be an error you're getting in the loop if there is nothing there, but not with the array...\n@KevinB and by \"there\", I just mean \"it is undefined\"\nI will add a new question for this specific scenario.\nYes, it's better to ask another question.\n@LynnCroudace but an array isn't infinite.. unless it's an array of undefined.\nI'm looking at the console errors and it's kinda weird.\n@KevinB hahah hahaha\n@LynnCroudace Well sure, you could make an array of infinite length...\n@JonathanLundell you're welcome hahah\n@KevinB yeah! It would be \"array of undefined\".\n@LynnCroudace oh! That means the \"undefined\" error would run then because it has an undefined length.\nThis is a very good question.\n@JonathanLundell but an array has a length, so if you do loop through it you could get undefined there at that particular index. But that's the same as what happened in the first case with the for loops with undefined.\nThis is not right. @JonathanLundell\n@LynnCroudace I don't see how it could.\n@LynnCroudace but then again, that's one of the more specific scenarios in the world of programming, not even including for..of.\n@LynnCroudace well he changed it to an array of undefined...\n@JonathanLundell That would just cause the index to be broken.\n@LynnCroudace but then again, that's not very specific, that's just \"array\"\n@LynnCroudace oh, I wasn't getting that far down\nAnyway, no, that isn't right. Unless the loop is broken or something.\n@LynnCroudace The console doesn't like undefined values (unless you use console.log of course)\n@JonathanLundell if you're inside a function that is called while you're not inside the function, you'd definitely get undefined the first time you loop through, unless you used console.log.\n@LynnCroudace It throws one here but it doesn't tell us what it is.\n@LynnCroudace you see console.log(i) outside the function there?\n@KevinB You could technically have it return an error and use it in a switch for an \"invalid\".\n@JonathanLundell yeah, but that throws an error\n@LynnCroudace yeah, but so does undefined\n@KevinB I think I know what I need to do: console.log(i); switch (validValue === undefined) { case i.l: // invalid break; default: console.log(\"I've never caught this before.\") }\ni.l = \"invalid\" if it's used in a case.\nThis should work, right?\ni.l would be valid\nBut if the loop were to never execute, i.l should be an error (unless we use console.log).\n@LynnCroudace yeah, it's not gonna execute for this\nIt's only for logging not breaking.\n@JonathanLundell if you console.log something outside, you get the error, though.\n@LynnCroudace oh right. It's throwing this:\nException in thread \"main\" jscomp.runtime.js:192 Uncaught TypeError: i.l is not defined\n@Justin what I'm saying is not what he needs. I was wrong, he was right. I just didn't understand him, but he was right. He needs to know when his iteration doesn't work, not when it's over.\nAnyway, I don't have time to make it today.\n@Justin and it's not the console's fault! It's in the code!\n@Justin he needs to know when an error is happening not when the loop ends.\n@LynnCroudace well that's not possible. The console could tell you when an error happens, it could tell you that 2+2=5, but it can't tell you whenever anything other than an error is happening.\n@LynnCroudace because it only returns the error for an error\nThe console.log will always return a message, as opposed to an error which you have to check for\n@Justin oh but I figured out that I could do this instead: debugger; console.log(i); debugger; switch (i.l) { case \"invalid\": // do a bunch of things console.log(\"error\"); break; }\n@KevinB that's not possible, but if I console.log your loop, it's possible... because console.log shows the value that your loop returns, because console.log() changes the return of a function\nAnd if you wanted to stop the loop early, you could:\ndebugger; console.log(i); loop(); console.log(\"error\"); break; loop();\n@JonathanLundell so the loop can be stopped by console.log?\n@Justin yeah, it's pretty weird that the console can be like that.\n@JonathanLundell I think it is, the way I'm making it anyway\n@Justin it can't just throw an error because you console that.\n@Justin well I was thinking you could do this:\ndebugger; console.log(i); if (i === InvalidVariable) break;\ndebugger; console.log(i); loop(); console.log(\"error\"); break; loop(); // i is always undefined\n@JonathanLundell and then I made some functions, too, that make it easier to loop through certain things while using other methods to loop through what wasn't necessary.\n@KevinB I can stop my code by using `if`, sure. But your code doesn't need to be stopped. It needs to work a certain way without stopping.\nWhich I realized I didn't really say what I wanted\n@KevinB there's no such thing as stop because you console.log\n@Justin I've seen that happen, yes. It's a pretty frequent occurrence\n@JonathanLundell I'm a js beginner here, can't you. I'll just be honest with you, can tell me if there an easy on how does your is there a specific reason of not get it.\nI'm not sure @Lundell that to write like that's like\n@JonathanLundell @Lynn ld. @KevinB the @J\nI'd like @Justin @Justin @Justin @KevinB @Lynn @KevinKevin@KevinC @Justin ld @Justin @Lynn 'm ld @Lynn @KevinB @Justin ld @Justin @kevinB @KevinB @Lynn @Justin ld @Justin @KevinB @Justin @Kevin @Justin @Lund @Lyn @Lyn @Justin @Kevin @Lyn @Justin @Lyn @ KevinB @KevinB @Kevin @Jon @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Kevin @Justin @Justin @Jon @Justin @Justin @Justin @Justin @Just in\n@Lund\n@KevinB @Justin @Kevin @Lund @Lund @JustinL @Justin @Justin\n@Kevin @Justin @Justin @Jon @Justin @Lund @Justin @Lund @Kevin @Lund @lund @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Justin @Justin\n@Kevin @Justin @Justin @Jund @Kevin @Lund @Kevin @Justin @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Justin @L @Kevin @Justin @Jon:\n@I und @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Justin @KevinB @Kevin\n@Justin @Justin @Just @Kevin @Jon @Kevin @Justin @L @Justin @Justin\n@Kevin @Justin @Justin @KevinB @Jon\n@Lund @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Justin @Justin @Justin @\n@Justin @Justin @Justin @Kevin @Kevin @Justin @Justin @Undin @Justin @Jon @Justin @Kevin\n@Jon @Just @J\n@Kevin @Justin @Justin.\n@Just @Jon @Justin\n@Kevin @L\n\nLjust\n@Kevin @Just\ni @Mis @Justin @Justin\nJon @Just @Justin @Kevin\n//Just @I keep @Justin`JS\n@Kevin @Kevin @Just", "num_tokens_generated": 4682, "OGF": 1.14306640625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 120.01538181304932, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 356, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

This method has a getCount() and a add() function. add adds the new enemy to the list, but it also updates the getCount. I need to pass a list of enemies so that a character can choose from the list to create a \"team.\" Now let's say I made a class and called it Dog.

John 6:66 is when the Jews attempted to stone Jesus. What do you suppose they were doing? Jesus already knew what they were doing. So the verse is true. (The Jews were not searching God for the truth. Many people today do the same thing. They search the scriptures for verses to justify themselves, instead of actually searching the scriptures for truth, which is Christ. So Jesus already knew what they were doing, He already knew they were attempting to stone Him. They really didn't seek because their intent (Gk. \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1) was not to seek.)\nIn John 6:66, John records, \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f71\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bf\u1f31 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03a6\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9. Now, in 6:70 Jesus asks the question, \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7b\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b8\u1f73\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u1f79\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; \u03bb\u1f73\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03bf\u1f55\u03c4\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u1f73\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1[\u03b2]\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5? What I am attempting to do is to show that verse 66 means that the Jews did not have the authority or power to execute Jesus, it was God who gave them to Jesus, and all that happens to them happens by God's authority, and for His purposes. John 6:70 is about the Jews rejecting Jesus as Messiah and they continue saying in John 6:71, \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03b1\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd.[d] \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f14\u03b8\u03b7 \u1f51\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u1f79\u03bd.\nJohn 6:35 Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall (Gk. \u03b3\u1f73\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd) not hunger (Gk. \u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c6\u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u1fc3 ), (\u1f10\u03ba \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u1f74 \u1f14\u03c7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1) and (Gk. \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f10\u03ba \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b8\u1f77\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9) he shall (Gk. \u03b3\u1f73\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9) in Me no thirst (\u03bc\u03b7 \u03b1\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03c8\u1fb6\u03bd[e] \u1f10\u03be \u1f15\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u1f7b\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 ).[a]\nJohn 8:58 Jesus said to them: (Gk. \u03bb\u1f73\u03b3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd: He said to them because they did not believe him.)
