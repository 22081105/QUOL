Thermo Traction with cervical traction in 3 directions (rotation of the cervical spine in different directions) and a 3-way traction of the lumbar spine on the posterior with traction in different directions. A special neck pillow with a 1cm gel insert and traction cervical collar allows you to relieve strain in your neck. There are two directions: cervical traction in 3 directions (rotation of the cervical spine in different directions) and lumbar traction in 3 ways on the posterior with traction in different directions 37 cm long of which 10 is traction (28cm). The main advantage of Thermo Hip is the adjustable traction range (from 1 to 6 cm) and easy operation.\nThe patient can independently set the mode so as not to feel any discomfort and pain.

This collar does not give pain or discomfort in the lower back. It acts as a support for the spine. The cervical collar is adjustable for both width and height. There is also a function to adjust the height of the cervical collar. Thermo Hip is also able to relieve the symptoms of neck pain, headaches and migraines, to relieve pain in the shoulder and lower neck. The patient can use it on one side or on both sides. Thermo Traction is an innovative treatment of spine conditions using new methods such as laser devices, ultrasound and TENS devices. Thermo Hip is a collar that helps to relieve pain by relieving it and restoring mobility to the whole body.\nThis collar supports the vertebrae and prevents herniated discs from protruding. It can be used by a person or an animal that has a spine problem. Thermo Hip is designed to be used by healthcare professionals as a tool to improve patients\u2019 health. Thermo Hip is made with soft materials to prevent injury to the patient\u2019s neck. It comes with two velcro straps and is worn on each side (on the front). Thermo Hip has been approved by the European Union for use in the treatment of patients suffering from spine conditions. Thermo Traction has two types of treatment: cervical and lumbar traction. It can relieve stress on the spine in people who have undergone surgical or traumatic injuries. Thermo Traction is an effective treatment.\nIn conclusion, traction devices are often used to reduce pressure and relieve headaches and other symptoms. Most people prefer to use a traction device that provides a warm or cold compress.\n\u0e01\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49: Things to Know Before You Get Your New Car Paints\n\u0e16\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e1b: The Ultimate Thermo Vest Guide to Knowing What to Buy", "num_tokens_generated": 869, "OGF": 0.212158203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 19.973867416381836, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 150, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

In 1887, the Michelson-Morley experimental performed to test Chapman's hypothesis resulted in null results. In 1905, Einstein published his special relativity theory, which explained how red shifts were related to the relative motion of objects. Soon after Einstein's theory showed that electromagnetic waves travelled at the speed of light in a vacuum.\nFurther evidence of the true nature of the aether came from a more detailed examination of the Michelson-Morley results. The experiment gave results at an accuracy of three one hundredths of a percent, and a repeat of the experiment by Dayton Miller in 1925 proved that any changes of the apparatus caused the results to be affected. Miller's more precise instrumentation showed a 2% red shift for the photonic aether, while lightwaves in the ether would have been shifted 44% to keep light waves from changing their Doppler effect. The ether, if present, was not transparent.\nThus the aether was discredited as an explanation of the red shift. But there were still some alternative explanations proposed. Special relativity requires objects that are stationary in inertial reference frames to have mass (matter) and charge (electric current), while luminiferous aether (photonic aether) was an inert material. The Michelson-Morley experiment showed that there was no absolute motion through the aether. In 1928, Arthur Eddington explained that the aether had the character of a field, and in 1929, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger proposed that the aether had to be a field. Schr\u00f6dinger's field was called the quanton field, while another proposed field, the field of force, was first suggested by David Bohm. The quanton field was a field of force that could be observed by detecting its photons.\nTheoretical physicist James Trefil in 2014 stated: \"The Michelson-Morley experiment clearly does not prove that there is no aether. On the contrary, it shows that the Lorentz transformation does not hold universally, and therefore that a Lorentz-invariant description of nature may not be possible. The fact that we still measure speeds of light in our laboratories to be c (plus or minus, maybe, 10-9 to 10-10) indicates that the Lorentz invariance may be a special form of invariance associated with very high speeds of light and/or very high frequencies of electromagnetic waves. This does not rule out the aether; it only means that if it is there, it cannot be described in the standard way by the Lorentz transformation, which must not therefore be universally valid.\"\nIn a 2007 paper, theoretical physicist James R. Schombert noted the Michelson-Morley experiment shows that \"the velocity of light in empty space [ie, vacuum] should [not] vary in an appreciable manner as a function of the orientation of the measuring apparatus within a given Lorentz frame... These experiments are not strictly comparable because in the Michelson Morley Experiment, the measuring apparatus is in a non-inertial reference frame [ie, the Earth], but the same should be true for the Michelson-Gale Experiment. The reason is that the velocity of light is related to the electromagnetic field, and the electromagnetic field per se does not change in an appreciable manner from frame to frame... As Einstein showed in his Special Relativity, the velocity of light [light propagation velocity] is not invariant under Lorentz transformations because the speed of light (c) is tied to the relative motion of the vacuum, or its materialized aspect, the electromagnetic field, through the theory of electromagnetism. Therefore, the Michelson-Gale Experiment should not be different in its conclusions about the aether-like properties of the photons of the vacuum and the electromagnetic field.\"\nThis page is a summary of: 40 Years: The Role of Time in Special Relativity[Editors: John A.

The world could have been different if history followed a slightly different path. What if a new technology or a scientific discovery, a revolution or a rebellion, a military event, a political decision, or a combination of some of the above had never occurred? What if electricity had never been discovered and people relied on other sources of energy and light? How would the scientific and technological development of humanity be affected? How would the daily life and communication of people be different? How would the economy and industry be impacted?\nThe project Kulto\u0301t kilometres is designed as an experiential laboratory for the exploration of an alternative modernity. A selection of events and phenomena from the history of humanity form the basis of different versions of the alternate timelines. To make these scenarios meaningful, they are re-examined from a new theoretical perspective, which helps to understand the nature of the events and phenomena as an integral part of the global historical process. These analyses are then used to design alternative scenarios and to reinterpret the contemporary situation from the point of view of the alternative history.\nThe \u201calternative modernity\u201d concept is used as the basis for experiential learning methods, and helps create alternative experiences and learning situations that are meant to generate cognitive dissonance, an experience that may result in new insights and enhanced understanding of the complex processes of the modern world.\nMaking an Alternate History\nAs an alternative history is not a true \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario but a product of human imagination, it has to be designed and developed.\nIt is based on a combination of theoretical analysis and individual imagination. It starts with a general hypothesis about a different reality of the real world. It then takes on the nature of the events from the chosen point in the real history, their chronology, consequences and implications. Often, the project has to make a guess as to the extent of the influence of the events on the course of the future. It often becomes clear during the construction of the story, when more and more details get clarified. The overall narrative is designed in a way that helps the participants identify with it and use it as a point of departure for the reflection on reality.\nThe most important requirement for a good alternate history is a good story.\nAlternate history is not just a new concept or a new approach. It is a product. It is a story. And the quality of the story is essential to its success. It should be powerful, captivating, convincing, and inspiring. It should encourage reflection and inspiration, and it should be capable of generating cognitive dissonance, which is an experience that may result in new insights and more enhanced understanding of the complex processes of the modern world.\nAlternate history is also a good story because it can help us understand the present better. It allows us to see things from a new perspective and to understand how different choices can lead to different consequences in the course of human evolution.\nMaking an alternate history can sometimes be difficult, frustrating or challenging. However, it is also a rewarding and creative process that can help us understand the world around us.\nAlternate History Experience\nAn alternate history experience is an immersive and creative activity that allows participants to take part in a new story from a different perspective. It is about stepping into the minds of different characters and experiencing a different reality. The experience is a combination of the visual, auditory and participatory approach. Participants are immersed in an alternate scenario where they take on the role(s) of different characters. The scenarios differ in complexity, with a variation of tasks and activities, and with a varying level of difficulty.\nAlternate history experiences can be used for different group sizes and different purposes. Examples could be:\nExploring history from different perspectives\nUnderstanding the present better\nIdentifying and developing new talents\nIdentifying and developing potential leadership qualities\nExploring future prospects\nDeveloping personal creativity\nEncouraging cognitive flexibility\nUnderstanding and dealing with complexity and conflicting aspects of reality\nDeveloping resilience\nAlternate history experience is an approach that allows participants to step into the shoes of different characters. They will be immersed in an alternate scenario where they will be engaged as a new and different person. Experiences can differ by the complexity of the scenarios, activities and tasks, and by an individual\u2019s skills and capabilities and other personal factors, such as emotional state.\nWe are designing a number of different scenarios that can be used for a range of different group sizes and contexts. The scenarios can be adapted to suit the specific circumstances. We also offer different levels of complexity and interaction to cater to different needs and levels of experience and skills.", "num_tokens_generated": 1067, "OGF": 0.260498046875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 24.300971508026123, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 159, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The findings from the 18th survey showed that the city centre is a popular meeting place for a wide variety of groups, all year round. Many respondents were from foreign business travellers, foreign tourists and groups coming on educational visits.\nEven more often, respondents were from foreign tourists travelling on their own or in small groups, and from young people celebrating a farewell or a reunion.\nThe survey focused on visitors coming to or through Goteborg in conjunction with major events and events with 400 to 500 participants. The survey was carried out in November and December. The survey is intended to be comparable with the results of the VISITORS SURVEY carried out in 2013.\nThe results are based on around 2,000 completed questionnaires. The respondents were shown the text: What is the most positive/negative thing about Goteborg?\nWe would like to see more young people. We have fewer attractions during the winter months. We always have too much traffic. The people here are good listeners, and they like spending time together.\nWhen we come here to work, we rarely spend any time outside. It is great to eat outdoors.\nMany respondents also said that they expected to come here again on a trip.\nYoung people tend to complain less that they have too little space to meet.\nThe survey was conducted to identify and analyse the strengths and weaknesses of Gothenburg through the eyes of visitors.\nThe survey will be used to help focus on future developments both in the city centre and throughout the city.\nThe survey is carried out together with Kvinnobilden and Gothenburg Tourist & Convention Bureau.\nThe overall aim of the survey is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Gothenburg through the eyes of visitors, both during weekdays and at weekends.\nThe purpose is to use this information to set priorities for measures that promote meeting places and strengthen Gothenburg as a meeting place.\nThe survey will be carried out in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nThe survey is intended for visitors who travel to Gothenburg to participate in a major event that is organised by a group or association, or who are visiting Gothenburg for work or to give presentations.\nThis target group includes congresses and exhibitions, as well as groups of tourists and business travellers, sports teams, student groups and educational visits.\nThe survey is conducted jointly by G\u00f6teborg & Co, Kvinnobilden and Gothenburg Tourist & Convention Bureau.\nThe survey is carried out for two years, followed by a short evaluation round.\nThe results are published on the survey website and in the Gothenburg Visitor Report.\nThe survey includes 53 questions relating to demographics, activities, reasons for visiting, impressions of Gothenburg, wishes and comments.\nThe questions were developed on the basis of the results of previous surveys, on an international basis and in Gothenburg.\nThe survey includes questions related to the city centre as well as a series of questions about the visitors\u00b4 experiences in Gothenburg, as a whole.\nThe survey only covers the target group of congresses and exhibitions, trade fairs and groups of tourists with a specific purpose. Participants in the survey are respondents from major events coming to Gothenburg.\nThe sample comprises around 2,000 responses. Around 800 questionnaires are completed and the remaining questionnaires are not analysed.\nThe questionnaires are handed out at all major events in the city, in bars and restaurants and at various events at specific times.\nThe result shows which parts of Gothenburg that most visitors go to, and how often they visit. The questionnaire is anonymous.\nData is collected from the questionnaires. In addition, a series of questions are asked at the beginning of the survey to obtain an overall impression of Gothenburg, the experiences of visitors and the future plans for Gothenburg. The results are analysed and a summary is written in consultation with the survey partners, which will appear in the Gothenburg Visitor Report at the end of each year. The survey will be conducted every year up to and including 2020.\nThe survey was carried out as a pilot study in 2001 and the first full-scale survey was carried out in 2002.\nThe findings of the 2015 survey are available on the survey website. Visitors from Scandinavia are the most critical of Gothenburg as a destination.\nThe respondents were most satisfied with the availability of good food and beverages, a well-functioning infrastructure and the ability of the city to get around. The survey was carried at a time of major reconstruction in Stampen Square. After the completion of the project in 2016, future surveys will show whether people are more satisfied with the square.\nThe overall picture is similar in both year groups, where visitors are concerned, the results show that visitors, whether from Scandinavia or elsewhere, tend to be of the opinion that Gothenburg could be more attractive and should be more active.\nThe majority of visitors to G\u00f6teborg are tourists who visit G\u00f6teborg independently and in small groups.\nThe tourists who are most likely to provide negative feedback are from Scandinavia, mainly the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.\nIn all categories, except nightlife, the Scandinavian visitors are the most critical of their experience in Gothenburg and they are the most likely to give negative feedback.\nPeople from northern Europe are generally more satisfied with their visit than visitors from other parts of Europe and other parts of the world.\nAnother difference is that visitors from Northern Europe often state that they are interested in visiting Gothenburg in the future.\nThe satisfaction with city restaurants and bars is similar for visitors from Scandinavia as well as those from other parts of the world.\nVisitors from northern Europe are more satisfied with the public transport system, than visitors from other parts of Europe and visitors from southern Europe.\nAll visitors who visit Gothenburg as part of a major event are satisfied with the city centre, although different groups place different focus areas.\nVisitors who come to Gothenburg on behalf of their employer or in connection with leisure activities are particularly satisfied with the availability of good food and beverages.\nGothenburg experiences a drop in satisfaction with the airport, which is often described as being small.\nVisitors from northern Europe are the most satisfied with the airport and least satisfied with the accommodation options and cultural activities on offer.\nThere is a marked increase in the amount of activity carried out by visitors who travel with business associations.\nRespondents who take an interest in sports are most interested in seeing a handball game, visiting a museum or attending an outdoor concert.\nVisitors who travel on their own as a single group are interested in the arts and culture as well as shopping, while visitors who travel with business associations are focused on sports, business meetings and conferences.\nIn 2009, it was found that 41% of participants travelled to Gothenburg on their own without any kind of programme. When these participants were interviewed in 2010, around two thirds were satisfied with their stay in Gothenburg.\nVisitors who travelled to Gothenburg on their own were mostly impressed with the location, the availability of good food and drinks and the number of events on offer in the city.", "num_tokens_generated": 2502, "OGF": 0.61083984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 59.326300382614136, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 160, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

When it comes to the duties that are expected. They are now expected to do that for all types of boats, ships, and submarines, the U.S. fleet is now expected to be ready for the tasks they have to be able re-enact as well as to be re-enacted. The new duty structure has been set up without any notice or public notice.\nThe U.S.Navy has established a new system of duties, but it is still unclear how many of the duties will be handled under this new method. There is a possibility that the Navy will come to replace the current fleet in the future if the duties are not handled under the current fleet, as the Navy will be able to provide the necessary training and equipment for the Navy by taking these duties on if the fleet is not re-enlisted. In the meantime, the current work and requirements for the U,S.,Navy are still in place. If you were to ask the Navy how many duty hours, what would they say to you if you asked them that, they would say that they would say that the Navy would have to be prepared to re-assigned the duties you take on to the fleet. If you ask them to re-enroll again, they would tell you that the Navy would re-enrolled if they would have to be assigned all that duty. The Navy should have the time to re-assign duty to the fleet. They should be re-enrolment-ready if the fleet needs to re-enroll the duties that they are expected to fulfill. But if the Navy is unable to fulfill those duties, they would have to be the ones to reassigned all of them to the fleet. That would mean that they would be unable to re-enolling the duties for which they are ready.\nThe Navy should have more than enough capacity to reassigned an entire fleet and be prepared to have such capacity and be able to provide those required capacity of those duties, but they would have to take the time to take on all of them. It would be better to take up a duty that is already in place and take the other ones that are required for the fleet, but the Navy should be prepared for the task that they would need to fulfill. As stated earlier, the U.. is still required to take up a number of duty duties that have been scheduled. This is because the U-boat is still required to take up many of these duties. The Navy would have the time after taking up a certain number of duty duties to take another several duties.

reader, when writing this article I've started with 'Awakened' by Alpha Blond, a song I consider one of the most interesting song that I've ever listened in my life.\nThe song was a real inspiration for me, because is one of those song that have a meaning behind it and when listening to it is like a personal experience, but I won't go too much into details because I want to give you the chance to write your own experience\nSo here's the Lyrics\nLove makes you blind,\nCan\u2019t see you\u2019re dead inside\nJust another dream,\nJust another lie\nLost in a maze,\nWith your everyday life\nWhat is a truth? What is a lie?\nA lie is just another truth\nTell me a lie,\nMake your day brighter\nJust another dream\nTell me the truth,\nWhat is the truth? What is the lie?\nAnd I'll keep you blind\nBlinded by love,\nEyes blinded by your light\nJust another lie,\nBetter yet just another truth\nTell me the truth, but then\u2026\nTell me a lie\n(Tell me a lie)\nMake your day brighter (Just tell me a lie)\nJust a lie\nBlinded by love (Just tell me a lie)\nEyes blinded by your light (Just tell me a lie)\nBetter yet just another truth (Just tell me a lie)\nJust another truth (Just tell me a lie)\nTell me a lie, just tell me a lie\nIt's your choice, tell me a lie\nTell me a lie, and I'll keep you blind (Tell me a lie)\nTell me a lie, and I'll keep you blind\nWhat is a truth? Tell me a lie (Just tell me a lie)\nTell me a lie, it\u2019s your choice\n(Just tell me a lie)\nWhat is a truth? Just tell me a lie\nEyes blinded by your light (Tell me a lie)\nYou see, I still feel that this song is very inspiring.\nThe first time that I heard this song I immediately began to think of my own experiences, my own songs, and the way I was doing a lot of things, and also how I felt that my experiences with writing wasn't going in the way, that I wanted it to go.\nThe way that I usually write is more 'organized', since it is the first time that I want to try writing about 'a genre' (but in a different way, you'll see further).\nIt's interesting how our personal experiences can actually inspire something that can actually inspire many others, but I will focus more into writing about writing songs, because that's the aim of this section.\nAnother thing that inspired me, and I've already talked about in the article 'Melodies from the Mind' is the fact that I was trying to have a certain feeling for all the instruments that I use (but more on that later).\nNow lets see what the song, and this whole thing, has taught me about writing a 'true song', something that is 'real', as in inspiring to so many, but most of all teaching you to really write a song from the heart, just like everything else should come from it.\n1 - Start from something that has a 'meaning' to you, maybe a song that you actually think about, listen to, a melody that makes you think, a riff or any other thing.\nAs I said I had used a song that I have listened to many times, that actually makes me think of a special experience that I have with the song itself, and also makes me think about the way that I was actually writing my other songs.\n2 - From that point on you just have to 'fill' the song with whatever you want.\nI actually used a lot of 'stuff' from my memories, and from personal experiences, the experience of when I was younger, but also my current memories from working as a DJ and from the things that I hear, but most of all from the experiences that I've also listened to, and the way that I was 'inspired' by all of them.\n3 - Write your 'feelings' into the song, the way that you think the song will actually make you feel, how you see others will react to the song, maybe even yourself after a while, or just even a time after you have finished, even when writing the second part (but also the way that you are listening to the song, after the song has been finished) and the way that will look back after a long time into the song and will be able even to understand the song, but also understand the 'meaning'.\n4 - The way that you will see the song in a year, when listening to it you will see different things, you will think different things, you will experience better feelings.\n5 - Write the real.\nWriting a 'true song' actually means letting your listeners understand what you are feeling, and showing it into a certain feeling.\n6 - If not, try to make the 'truth' the 'liar', just use a 'lie'\n7 - When writing a 'true song you don\ufffdts' have to 'truth' be'lol'n't tell me the 'liar's, 't', be' the 't' and it'll 'tell you 'lie 't' be't you 't't't's't't't,\n8 - Letter, no one be 't't be't, 'i't'll, and 't'w be't't.

Harper was the second American to land on the Moon. He flew on the Apollo 15 mission from July 26, 1971 to August 1, 1971. He flew on a three month long mission which brought him to the Moon. Harper was the first person to fly to the Moon with Apollo 15.\nAn Inspiring Story About People in the Space\nA few months ago, NPR released an audio documentary, called \u201cMoonwalkers.\u201d It tells their story about being the first humans on the moon. These men landed the lunar module \u201cEagle\u201d in the Sea of Tranquility. This documentary has been aired on NPR stations and podcast sites.\nThe Apollo 11 mission is the beginning of my experience that changed my entire life. It was July 21,1969 at 10:50 pm. The Apollo 11 Spacecraft Ejected The First Person To Walk On The Moon. Neil Armstrong stepped out into space and the world was witness to the most extraordinary event.", "num_tokens_generated": 1848, "OGF": 0.451171875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 43.02457904815674, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 174, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The real answer is \"a stainless-steel hand-cuff key hanging on a lanyard around my neck.\" Sceptics get it, and know when I talk for real or for effect, but that doesn't get us any closer to understanding how this trick works, and why magicians are still doing it 200 years later. For that, you need a model. The scientific method of experimentation and validation is a good model for describing how to produce an effective magical effect and how the world might perceive it. Let's look at the various stages of the scientific process, from developing a hypothesis to making a final model, and see how they can add or substitute for the magic model. A model provides structure and meaning, but we should understand the purpose and properties of a model. A model can be anything physical, mathematical, or conceptual. Think of a map of the world. It may include a drawing of a globe. It may be in three dimensions, such as on a globe. It may only include a picture of a globe. It may not include the name for every country at every spot. A model can be a computer-generated image of a human face. It can be a diagram of how the body is physically connected to the brain. It can be a piece of artwork. It can be the shape of the letter \"O\" in your writing with lines running from it toward different parts of the writing. Or it can only be the lines from the \"O\". You could use a model for magic to simulate other types of phenomena. You could take the idea of a model and put it in a different context and get a different purpose, outcome, or meaning. Or you could just make a mental model out of words or ideas and use it to see new things. You can also see many different models by taking one and changing its properties in some way. There might be many different ways to use the same model or a similar model for something. If you take the shape of a circle and put it through a hole in the middle of a larger object, you will get its circumference. If you take the model and connect it to other objects around\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZs6Wu46lYw&ab_channel=NateBushman\n#Would You Rather #Would You Rather Questions / 5/11/98 #18 #1-10 #1-5 #11-15 #11 #6-10 #6 #7-10 #7 #8-10 #8 #9-10 #9 #10-10 #10 #11-10 #11 #12-11 #12 #13-10 #13 #14-14 #14 #15-17 #15 #16-19 #16 #17-15 #17 #18-16 #18 #19-15 #19 #20-15 #20 #21-20 #21 #22-9 #22 #23-8 #23\n#18: Would you rather have a pet dinosaur or a pet unicorn?\n(W) WOULD YOU RATHER (4/18/98 #1-10 #15-21 #15 #Fear)\n\"Ask me again in a few years...

quick check on this one reveals a lot.\nFirstly, you seem to have misunderstood what you have copied to the clipboard.\nClipboard: [91] Hello World \uff63 \uff0e \uff0f \u3014 \uff65\nThis is correct. You entered the hexadecimal (base-16) digits for a single U+202b (SOFT HYPHEN) character to the clipboard. As that's all it is, when you paste into Notepad++ you get a stack of characters displayed as a single word, as it will assume you have typed that in. See?\nSecond, when you actually type it into Notepad++ it looks like this when using the character mapping of the Editor:\nClipboard: [91] Hello World \uff63 \uff0e \uff0f \u3014\nYou can then choose Unicode, and it's all displayed as you would expect. The problem is that your choice of character encoding in Notepad++ is UTF-8. When you select that, Notepad++ thinks that each of these characters is the UTF-8 byte sequence that that character maps to; hence the output.\nLastly, I'll leave you with the fact that the following does work:\nClipboard: [72] Hello World \uff63 \uff0f\nThe character above is an acute (\"\u00b4\") accent (\"\u00b4\") over the second \"o\" (\"o\") and it just so happens that that character is encoded as U+006a when using UTF-8. As UTF-8 ignores the concept of bytes (which is why it's not called \"UTF-7\"), the character can also be displayed as \"o\u0301\", which, on the web, is written as \"`o`\".
