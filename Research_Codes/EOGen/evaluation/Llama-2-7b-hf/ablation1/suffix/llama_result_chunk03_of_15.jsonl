But now these tables are too many to parse one by one, and i think xlrd also have a slow performance which is bad for my work. I need a more rapid way.\n\nComment: As I can see with you question you know how to load the html data into python. All you have to do is split the file on line, convert the data to format python expects and then parse the data. The only thing that looks strange is that you want to split a file on each row - I find this strange because that's almost like asking to read file line by line.\n\nComment: Actually, I have found out an evil way to solve the problem using re. some code like:\n\nf = re.sub(r'\\sx\\:str=\"(.+)\\\">', r'>\\1', f)\nBut it looks like too violent.

So you can make it an answer without providing the code to do this (because what to do with it would be a separate question). I'm just saying that it would make a nice answer.\n\nComment: Okay, I have written a python script to extract data from html by myself. Thank you!\n\nComment: I could still give a code.

I had no idea the order of magnitude, but the fact that it is the same means something changed: either they made it work on the CPU architecture of choice, or something else.\n\nComment: As with most things concerning performance optimization, don't expect any concrete conclusions from such a 2 minutes test. The CPU might be more efficient in some ways to the CPU from 5 years ago but this might have no effect on that specific algorithm. It also depends on the compiler and target platform. And there might be compiler specific optimizations. Just don't get too paranoid and start optimizing everything.\n\nComment: @\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 I do not have high expectations. If the algorithm would have been 16000% slower than the best algorithm from the SO - it would be the first place for me to start optimizing (as I do not know what else it could gain me).\n\nComment: @VilleVuorinen - That's what I like you're thinking of optimisations. But you can optimise a bit of code too far and it might even run slower (at least on my machines it does). For example I don't use `assert` when I'm writing a `cpp_only` program and some of the users on Stack Overflow (especially the very nice and always helpful \u029eoo\u0265) would not agree with the idea.\n\nComment: @\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 You mean, if they made it work, it would be the least expensive version (not faster)\n\nComment: @VilleVuorinen I don't know what exactly they changed but the performance gain is so huge it would mean most or all other implementations need some redesigning.\n\nComment: @VilleVuorinen As I said, it is still pretty much noise, but in the opposite direction. This is still over 1000 times slower than it should be (although it is closer to that now)\n\nComment: @VilleVuorinen Also, I need to know if what I found is reasonable, not if it is fast. So I will try clang++ with `-O4`, `-Ofast`, `-O2` and -O1.\n\nComment: @\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 What if we measure it with `for (int i = 0; i < 4000; ++i) A[i] = i;` and run it multiple times, and add up the last 3.5s? What would you get for the average?\n\nComment: @Stitch - That's OK, but the problem is, the way computers are written they usually need to run a program thousands of times before they can do that. Maybe one program just can't keep up. We don't really have any ideas if that's the case but I doubt it. Maybe it's because of a different way of doing computations now? But I guess that would mean there was an overhaul on the implementation of the CPU (and I don't think that really happened).\n\nComment: @\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 What I need to know is if it is reasonable that code written 5 years ago would suddenly (10, 60, 120, 240s) be faster. Of course I understand that it is not reasonable.\n\nComment: @Stitch - This is only reasonable if the implementation itself has not changed. If the program is written to take advantage of that then it might work faster. The CPU might have changed its behavior. We don't know exactly what was changed in 5 years (other than a lot, in theory) but we can assume nothing has changed or you wouldn't see the numbers you see.\n\nComment: @\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u1fe5\u03b5\u1fd6 So how can I \"measure\" it to see if this assumption is \"reasonable\" (or how can I get it over with)? I understand that it is not reasonable for CPU performance to change in an order of magnitude, but I do not know if it is *more* reasonable (to be *more unreasonable*) than what happened in the past for AMD.\n\nComment: I don't know, sorry. It's very much up to you if you want to do a lot of testing, compile a C++ program and compare benchmarks (which will be different probably) and compile optimized assembly code, and then have a benchmark that is actually comparable. That's not what I'm here for right now. It's up to you to find the solution. So far I only made a (wild) assumption and didn't base it on the test results.\n\nComment: You should be better off with profiling your code - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/320232/what-is-the-best-way-of-profiling-a-c-program for the approach to do it.\n\nAnswer: C++ has changed a LOT and compilers have become more clever at optimization.\n\nYou should check https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/compiler, https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/defaulted_functions", "num_tokens_generated": 1202, "OGF": 0.29345703125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 27.73858404159546, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 130, "chunk_index": 3, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

{\n            for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n            {   // Primary loop.\n                if (data[c] >= 128)\n                    sum += data[c];\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);\n        System.out.println(\"sum = \" + sum);\n    }\n}\nWith a similar but less extreme result.\n\nMy first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but that's silly because the array was just generated.\n\nWhat is going on?\nWhy is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? \u5f35&

However, I am not able to get all the contents in the row. For example, for each row, I still can only access the data in column 1.

(i.e. \"clients\")\n\nComment: When I have tried accessing row 2, the \"C\" for the Clients is lost. I guess maybe the index number I used is for the column but not for the row?\n\nComment: @Andy: What is the error message you are getting? To answer your question as I was confused, I am not sure what `Clients` is, or the `column` name is, and this should be clear from your question... That said, perhaps you are still using `Clients[2]` and you should be using `row[3]....` for example.

It must have class-level accessor variables name and age.\" I think that the error comes from line 3, when I am calling name=\u201cAlice\u201d, then trying to access it in line 4, where I'm calling name = self.name, so I think it's accessing name before it has been set, which is where the error is caused. In line 5 I'm calling @name = name which I think is fine, because it's setting my @name variable. Lines 7 and 8 are creating the Person objects, then in line 9 I'm calling alice.greet(bob, 'How are you?') which causes the problem, because, as far as I understand it, I am trying to pass self.name, self.age as arguments to the greet method and then calling other as first argument and name as second, even though I've not assigned this argument yet. If this is the case I don't know if I should wait for the assignment of arguments before trying to pass them through, or if it's because I'm calling a method which is trying to assign it and then passing it back through. Thanks for any help in advance!\nHow should I implement the greet method?\nCoding a Frogger Game in Ruby -- Tutorial and Source Code\nI'm doing a course in Ruby programming and I need to build a Frogger game in Ruby as part of the coursework. I'm not sure if anyone has done this before though, as there isn't a lot of information around. This is the assignment in full here: https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-ruby-the-hard-way/001888e758f24c47bc1a4ca1ec2d04ed and I made the game in GameMaker, which was more complicated. The first thing to do is to look at the rules around Frogger and learn them, then I can implement these. I found a website called https://alltoptips.com/frogger.php that explains how to play the game and the rules and that is helpful. Then, I will try to find some source code that works as a sample implementation, or maybe even code from a similar game, so that I can see how Ruby works in this context. I'm using this version of Ruby: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6450151/what-version-of-ruby-to-use-for-learn-ruby-the-hard-way Then I will try to understand how to do these things in Ruby, and implement it. The first thing is to draw images that represent the various elements in the Frogger video and to make each part of the player work individually when you press the button that corresponds to that part of the frogger game. Then I will try to place elements of the game into the graphics that represent them i.e. cars on one side and frogs on the other, as well as the other items that appear. I'm not entirely sure how to do this in Ruby, but I will probably need methods that call other methods that move the player's parts of the game based on their position in the game, and also other methods that draw things on screen that will be the actual frogs and the cars. Is this possible to do, and are any resources available for Ruby tutorials on the internet to help me? I have tried these tutorials https://learnyousome.ruby.sg/ and https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-ruby-the-hard-way/, but neither of them teach Ruby for games, which I think I might need to know about for this tutorial.\nIs there a reason to be using Ruby 2.3.3 to learn Ruby?\nHere's the assignment in full: https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-ruby-the-hard-way/001888e758f24c47bc1a4ca1ec2d04ed and on the left here in the image, it says, \"If you use a version of Ruby later than 1.8.7, your computer may not be able to run the game. Use Ruby 1.8.7 instead.\" and on the right, it says, \"We strongly recommend installing Ruby 1.8.7. You can use Ruby 2.3.3 while you\u2019re first learning Ruby, but it\u2019s very different from 1.8.7 and won\u2019t let you use a good tutorial.\" Is it necessary to use Ruby 2.3.3 when trying to learn Ruby? The reason I ask is because I have tried Ruby and there doesn't seem to be any problems with Ruby 2.3.3 on my computer, it just runs as it should but if it is a requirement for the course, I will install Ruby 1.8.7.

G\u00e4ser is a plant that blooms in spring, and which, even when it is not in bloom, has many beautifully coloured flowers. Do you know how the flower changes its hues, from purple to rose, then to orange, then brown, then green? This is the way it happens, and now my head, too, has changed colour until even some of the green leaves are brown. When we return home in the evening, let\u2019s have some supper\u2014my stomach is growling with hunger. Let the dishes be put on the table, and when I see how they are served, I shall eat. I only wish you could have a glance, dear reader. I see that the dishes have not been arranged on the table as I wished, and that what I wished to have is missing. In a moment I shall be raging with anger. At a table like this I should like to have dishes made of beautiful, clear, hard, and transparent glass: large glasses that can hold at a single draught a bucket of wine, and other glasses so large that a man can drink a quart of wine quickly. Next to these glasses, there should be cut-glass wines which must be the finest and the clearest that can be found: the finest, the clearest. But here there are only small, cracked, and poorly made glasses.\nWhat? you ask. Have I gone mad, dear reader? There is no cause for alarm. Perhaps you have not thought of it, but I had already made up my mind at the time of the feast in the dining-room, about which I said nothing, that I was going to the kitchen. That is why I brought no candle with me, but I was not so inconsiderate that my presence should frighten the servants, so I gave them warning through the curtain. Let us go to the kitchen. What can be done? All I can do is to write and tell what is required for meals. I cannot ask a servant what is on his or her mind, let us try to make out from the table what a man\u2019s thoughts are. We have just now found out that the servants, even the men, are not so much interested in the things on the table as they are in the plate that was given them.\nIs it so with you, dear reader? Do you still remember the time when you sat here in your room beside your desk, and you took up a pen; then you looked into the mirror, saw that your hair and coat were not in order, took your brush in hand and comb, and began to brush and to comb? And the comb went into your mouth and your hair stood on end, so that you were not able to pay attention to what you had begun to write. Was it then so with you? Do you remember those words that came between your fingers, and made you angry because you could not write them carefully? And so on with the toilet\u2014wearing a wig in summer is a great hindrance. I often want to write something of great importance, and there stands an untidy hair before me.\nI look up once to the sideboard, where glasses are standing, and I am disturbed in my work again, and now I see the toes of a woman\u2019s slipper. I have often been in the kitchen myself after dark. Once, on a dark night, I was sitting in the kitchen, alone with a dumb servant who could neither read nor write, when a man came in through the door of the kitchen, whom I thought was someone who had found out my occupation, and who in his attempt to get into my room began to pound away on the back of my chair with knuckles of such hard bone that I was on the defensive the whole evening and had no chance for any work, for I cannot use a knife, nor sew, nor paint. We might think that such a clumsy person would never guess what I was doing, so the kitchen is not exactly the place for someone to be doing anything good or bad. What if one should write something terrible\u2014if you could read that, you would not dare to come into the kitchen. But the servant who came yesterday and was so interested in what was written here is also a good cook\u2014he is called the Count\u2019s brother-in-law, but I shall not mention his name. He is also a great reader of novels and comedies, and it was to him that I gave a present last year, and said that I had been there for 24 hours. He understood that I was a writer, for when I came from the office, I had brought home a copy of a novel by a novelist I had met there. If you want to know whether a man is a good cook, just ask him about the dishes, and listen to the reply. \u201cThis is such and such a dish.\u201d \u201cWell, but that looks a simple thing,\u201d and you try to get the man to tell you how he managed to cook it. Now I know that the man who cooks simple dishes is a good one. He thinks not of himself, but of getting the dishes ready in the best manner, and is not interested in which way the dishes came into the world. A well-washed dish is a work of art, but that, dear reader, is for the next essay: I now want to talk about the dishes, and show you which are right and which are wrong.\nThe first thing that caught my attention was a plate: with what a great deal of skill was the plate decorated! The artist must have spent a great deal of time on this. He who sees only white and red can have no idea how fine the red is with white. But I should like to say a few words about these things, and then you must tell me what my opinion is.\nI want to talk first about the dishes. What is the good that comes from them? A dish should be of a certain shape, and that shape should be formed before it is made of clay and fired. The potter makes the dish after the shape has been determined by the plumber; it is then taken to the glazier, who paints on it whatever the potter has drawn. But if you have any doubts about what dishes are like, or what colour they should be, when you go out and buy some, ask the dishwasher.\nThe potter paints not only the dish, but also stamps it with initials of his trade-mark. This shows that the potter has made himself a master of his art. The man who can only write his name is not much of an artist, but I should say that he is more of a tricksy craftsman than an artist. If the man who painted the dish which I have in mind had but his own word for it, I would not believe it, for it looks like a woman\u2019s leg in stockings, and the initials are not those of a potter, but of an upholsterer. These are the initials of E. K\u00d6NIG (K\u00d6NIG, the King), and this is a great man who, however, did not finish the dish but died young by overworking his brains, for which I can understand the potter\u2019s initials, because he was a good potter. But I cannot understand how a tradesman who was so clever as to be able to paint a leg and knees, should be such a stupid fellow as not to be able to make a leg and a knee.\nThe man who painted the dishes, however, could be a real potter, for he did not need to be taught how to paint a leg from the nude model. But what was he thinking of when he painted legs on dishes? A woman is not very different from a dish, and, in my opinion, it would be very easy for a man who paints dishes, and who can therefore paint any sort of legs, to make a woman out of clay which is quite a different sort of material from clay which you can buy in the market. For my part I am willing to believe that the man from whom I took this plate of dishes did not mean to paint a dish, but a woman\u2019s leg. But it would be a mistake to think, merely because he painted a woman\u2019s leg on the dishes, that he painted a woman\u2019s leg on the dishes because he did not know any better. I would not be so foolish as to take that idea; if that were the case, I would have to buy women\u2019s legs from the dealers in Easter eggs.\nBut it might happen that a man who was making dishes, and knew nothing about painting, might look at a woman\u2019s leg and want to paint it on a dish. Would that then be a good idea? You might not be able to read the potter\u2019s initials\u2014\u201cR. BACH (BACH, Bach).\u201d It would then be easy for a man who wanted to make a lady\u2019s leg (and she would be of a strange make) to buy a dish and paint it red and white in good style; then he would say, \u201cthat is how a woman\u2019s leg must be.\u201d He would be mistaken; if a woman\u2019s leg should be such an extraordinary thing, you would not buy one for 6 pfennings, as such legs have been seen. What, then, would such a lady\u2019s leg look like, if she were able to walk and get into a carriage like any other woman? That would look quite like a monkey. But I can now make the dish. Take a woman, and bend over the table so that your head is over the table, and your body is stretched over the back of a chair, then say, \u201cThe dish is done.\u201d I cannot finish it, but have only just begun. It is easy enough to make a woman with legs, hands, and feet\u2014that is the way women are made\u2014but the question is, how could one put all these parts together so that such a strange woman should look like a woman? The man who has painted the initials of R. BACH on the dish did, indeed, make it look like a human being, when he painted them over his work, thus making it appear red and white and quite as good as any other dish. But I think that only the maker of the whole thing should be blamed, for you only have to give a dish to some one, and then he will say, \u201cOh, the beautiful dish!\u201d I should like to tell you about something which looks very strange, and I have only just put the initials of an inventor R. BACH on it, and have shown that the red and white stripe on the dish does not come from the potter, but from the inventor R. BACH, who wanted to make a lady\u2019s leg out of clay and painted it so. Now comes\u2014he wanted to make a whole woman out of porcelain and paint it red and white. It does not look like a human being: it is painted on in the wrong way, with one leg on the other side, and so it does not look like a lady but like a monkey. You might take a piece of wood and cut it in form of a dish, and you might paint it red: then the whole work would be of wood and not of clay. It might be a very fine piece of wood and a work of art, and it would then indeed look like a human being, and one would have to see whether it is a woman or a man. It might be like that with a dish; but for my part I should not do anything to it that would prevent its looking like a human being. I do not know that man who would want to make a woman out of wood\u2014I should say, firstly, that he did not know what he was doing, and secondly, that I did not wish to know him at all. You might say that it is unlucky to tell about something that does not yet exist, but what do you know about that? Have you not thought of something and did not tell it or write it down? I never thought of anything that can be made; I thought only of things that people have made. In this way I am not afraid of telling people of something that does not exist, because it would be an invention, and it is only an invention\u2014for how could it be anything else\u2014if I had done it myself? And I do not want to invent anything. But if you invent something and write it down, everyone will say that you are an inventor, and you will have to be careful of what you do with your life, where you go, and what you eat. That is why I do not write here, that you should think I am so foolish as to invent something, but only so that it shall appear that I do not believe any of the things that I say, but that I only have a few good thoughts about things which are not made, nor will ever be made. For you see, that would be too much for a poor man, and it is also of no good to anyone, for how would a potter get on if I should invent something and then let everyone make a large profit from it? Then do not think that I am a bad fellow when I speak badly of that kind of dishes.\nAn inventor has his own stamp\u2014the initials which we read on the dish are always his own. I should, then, also have my own stamp, if I made a large profit out of it, because I would feel that I had done something for which I should get my reward some day\u2014that is all I have in mind. If you have such a stamp and cannot write your name on any of your work, then you ought to take pleasure in making something, and it will not be long before you will learn to write your name.\nIt would be a sad thing for you, dear reader, if you were not able to write your name. I remember once seeing a great man of learning who had just come from a foreign country and could not write his own name. I wondered how such a man could have travelled so far, and yet he could not write his own name. I have never seen any one of the greatest merit who could not write. And do you think, dear reader, that I will not have such dishes as these? I think that I may yet begin to understand my profession, and then let the potters and those who make them see that R. BACH can make a whole dish, and that he can make a whole dish of a different pattern. I think that I can make a whole dish that is shaped after a man, a woman, or a horse, and has the head and arms and feet, and does not look like a man, but like a dog, or horse, or cow; and I think that in this way I can put the red and white stripes on the dish. It is not difficult to paint and get into the market, but to go and get a dish out of the oven is not so easy; in the year 199 my oven was not clean, and the potter had to put three dishes out of four into the cooler before I could get them into the dining-room; but this does not mean that I will not paint the initials of R. BACH on the dishes; if I have money enough to order ten thousand dishes drawn with a knife, there is nothing to fear: you will be given a receipt every time a thousand is ready, and the rest can be done afterwards without the drawings or the oven.\nBut in spite of all the talk of mine, my intention is not to make a whole dish, or any more dishes, as I do not believe that it is possible to do such things; and it is also impossible to make a man who resembles in every way those that you can see in the picture-gallery, for I do not know how to make a human being. If you tell me that it can be done, then I give up the whole thing. I do not believe in people who can do it; but I know that it is possible to paint only on a dish and not make an elephant out of a dish. A human being is only painted, and when you paint an elephant out of porcelain, you only paint the skin of an elephant out of porcelain, and when you put the dish in the oven, the skin melts away from the dish, and the fire then turns the remaining material into dishes. That, dear reader, is a strange story, and it may be that you do not like to hear me speak so. But I think that it will make you feel better to know that I do not think anything of the sort, and that if I were given R. BACH for my initials I would say, \u201cWho am I anyway but BACH the potter?\u201d\nBut I want to say something more about an inventor. I shall say now that you cannot copy an invention, because it is not the same thing as making a copy by making the same thing. A man\u2019s invention is always a new thing, and if it is, then it is a thing of which one cannot make a copy; nor can I myself take a good idea from a man and use it, because I shall always produce something different from the first idea. This is easily shown when I am making my own cup out of clay, before the oven. The man who wanted to copy a cup did not see the thing properly, and he put the handle in where the spout is; there cannot, then, be a second cup which is a forgery of the first. No two inventions can ever be alike.\nThere is such a fearful number of inventions, dear reader, that I think that anyone who thought he could copy them all would have to go through a lot of difficulties, if not in his life, then at least in his mind, and all the more so if he thought of making his own inventions. You must, then, be content with the first thing that comes to hand, which is the second thing that comes to mind; but then the thing which comes to mind is not the same thing that comes to hand. All that I have tried to do is to make you see that the first and second of the things that come to hand are nothing but two things that have come from the man\u2019s head, and that the way the things came to hand also came from another head. And if I then had the courage to write my own name on the dish, then one who had a bit of sense would tell me, \u201cWrite R. BACH instead.\u201d I have told you what to do, now do it. All this, then, is nothing else but the art of painting with clay. Now let me go to bed on Friday, because it will keep me from falling asleep this Friday night, for I think that I have not enough. I am a poor man. I can buy a new dress. I like to buy a new dress a new dress for. I am I am I like to buy a dress a new, and am not.

The answers to these questions are the focus of this book.\nIn order to find the answer, we have to go back through the history of languages. A word is a unit of meaning. It is the smallest unit of language used in communication.\nLanguages always have an inventory of words, a dictionary and dictionary entry. You also find these words in texts written by authors, in stories and on web pages.\nWords can have a similar meaning to a word you know in your own language. However, sometimes a word has a similar meaning to a word from another language that you know.\nIf you search on the internet using a dictionary, you will find all the words a group of languages have.\nIf you search for a word using a dictionary and the name of the language to which it belongs, you will find more words from other languages of the same group.", "num_tokens_generated": 200, "OGF": 0.048828125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 4.392866849899292, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 148, "chunk_index": 3, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
