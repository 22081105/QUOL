He discusses what bonds couples together in an intimate relationship, what hurts relationships, what helps relationships stay together, and what destroys relationships. The video then presents three couples at different developmental stages of a relationship: at the beginning when feelings and lust are dominant, in the middle when emotional responsiveness is important, and at the end when friendship and trust can either make a relationship stronger or destroy a relationship.\n14:47https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-2b7uUuR0kHow to Make Friends\nThis video discusses what friendships are and provides tips on how to make friends.\n01:13https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-X1XrQXfHMWhat is a Best Friend\nBest friends are the most special people in a person's life.

If you can't find a peer, consider inviting someone else for this interview if, for example, your class is much larger than the other classes in the community.\nIf you are not able to travel to a classroom today, a good place to interview a peer is on a video call (such as Zoom or Google Meet). To do so, invite a peer (perhaps via WhatsApp or email) for a video call interview. After the interview has concluded, write down your peer's responses.\nIf you cannot find a peer, find some other persons who you can interview for your class project.\na. Use questions found in this unit.\nb. Come up with questions yourself.\nc. Invite a person to ask the questions. You can, for example, find the answers to the questions from another student. You might find it helpful to write the questions and the answers in a document and share the document with your classmates.\nd. The interview could be done on paper, during which time a recording could then be made. Or, it could be done on Zoom or another software so that a recording can be done automatically.\ne. If you make a video and upload it to YouTube, you can link to it in your document (above).\nf. If you write down the answers in a text (or perhaps a document on Google Docs) that can then be viewed here, here's how:\n1. Go to: https://www.freeconvert.com/youtube-to-txt\n2. Paste the following address in the address field: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y4wb6KWV8Q and click on \"Convert\"\nThen, you should have a text file which can be placed in your file section of this site. Note: You'll need a Google account to download it.\nf1. If there is any text (such as an intro of the video) at the beginning of the video and if there is some music in the video that you'd like to remove, just go to: https://www.youtube.com/findusertag?st=1&tag= and in the field \"YT User Tag:\" enter the name of the user and in the field \"YT Video Tag:\" enter the video tag and click on \"Search.\" Note: a video can have different tags. For example, if someone has a channel named \"English Playground\" and someone else has a channel with \"EP,\" then both of those videos and tags can be seen in that field if you enter \"EP\" (without quotes.\nIf you're having problems trying to copy the address of a video to enter in the address field, you can try to press \"Control+F\" and paste the address into the search field. This should help you find the address of the video.\n3. Once you've found the address, copy that address and paste it into the \"Start conversion from\" box on the site. You should see the video. You can then copy and paste the link so that it becomes an active link.\ng. You can add a title to the text (in YouTube there are two title parts) and you can also add tags to the text so that it has a searchable key word. In order to find the tags, you have to go to the \"Transcripts\" tab on the video. Under the video, you'll see a button that when clicked will give you another list of tags (i.e., \"Mix.\"\nGo to the Transcripts, and click on the button. You should be able to scroll through the transcripts and then find the tags (such as \"Mix\" and \"Duet.\" ) If you add some tags (and they can be anything you want) you also need to add a description. You can add a description in the Youtube description section after you copy the video link.\nIn YouTube, in the video section go to the settings tab and click on that. Then, in \"Edit\" click on \"Edit Video Info.\" Now you'll be on a page where you'll see the title. You can edit the title and also you can add some tags. You can then add a description and then preview the changes and save them.\nYou can also choose which chapters of the video will be downloaded.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to download a file in .txt please make sure it is the first .txt file (otherwise it'll only be a transcript of the video and not the text file)\nc. Click on \"Transcripts\" tab, which will give you a list of the transcripts of the video. Scan the transcript and look for sections of conversations that you'd like to download (and there's one at 0:05 for this example - \"The interview will last for a little over 25 minutes.\" )\nd. Next click on the arrow that points down, and a pop-up window will appear.\nOnce a popup will appear, press \"Transcript,\" and then you can click on the downloaded section of the conversation and the full conversation will be downloaded in a transcript that you can print.\nNote: The number of transcripts (such as those in YouTube) depends on the user and on what the user has done previously. Some users will upload their transcripts every time they get a chance so that people can download them and use them in a variety of ways.\ne. The transcripts will download as a .txt file. If you want to create a video or an audio of the interview, then you may need to upload it to a site for uploading videos, such as YouTube. To do so, you should create an account on YouTube which will allow you to upload videos. After the video has been uploaded (which can take up to 24 hours for the file to be uploaded) you can then download the video and share it.\nYou can create video by using a program such as FL Studio which will allow you to upload a file and then create a video out of it.\nTo edit the video in a program such as FL Studio, you'll need to know how to edit videos. In this video, you'll see how to create a video by taking audio, and adding some effects to it. You won't, of course, be adding the effects that are shown in the video.\ng. If you prefer to use an audio only program, such as Audacity, you can first use a text-to-speech program to read a transcript and then save it as a wav or mp3. If there is some background noise in the interview, you can reduce the background noise in Audacity or similar programs.\nh. If you're using a transcript, you'll likely have to convert the transcript to an audio file. You can do this is by downloading the transcript and reading it so that you'll learn it by heart. Then, you can read it by adding it into Audacity, or into a video editing software so that it creates an audio file. Then, you can take out all the sounds that are not the sound of the human voice and the background noise. This will give you more control over the sound of the interview. If there's heavy background noise it may require more than one attempt to get it right.\ni. Once you have your audio it can then be used anywhere in a video or in an audio, in an animation. This can be done in a variety of ways. One way is to import the audio into the software. In that import, you can choose certain options of how the audio will play. If you select \"wav\" as the audio format, then you have greater control over the audio. It may be that you record audio and decide that you want to delete something in the audio and do so by editing the audio, but if you import an audio into the software, then you have more control over what is recorded and thus you have more control over the sound. You can then export that audio to other purposes.\nd. Now if you want to create a video you'll need to download your audio and then use a video editing program such as FL Studio to add both your audio and your video to the mix.\nIn this program there are other options of what you can do with your video. You can add effects to it and you can add other things such as music to the video.\nThere are other video editing programs such as Adobe Premiere, which allow you to edit audio and video together (or with other effects, such as music). There are a variety of ways you can combine your video with audio. You can mix them so that it seems as if you are having a conversation. That's called an \"interview.\" An interview could be used in education for instance an oral interview where a person is asked questions and answers them in real-time. An interview can also be conducted with students in a classroom who then present it and in that case it's a presentation.\nYou can also edit footage to make it look like a comic book.

A paper outlining that study's results is available at http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es5014923.\nDr. Martin gives his view in the video https://youtu.be/Csj0ZW28pw8 on whether biodiesel is ready for the mainstream.\nFollowing is an excerpt from that video transcript.\nJim Martin: I think that this is a very good example of a technology that is moving into commercial scale because of environmental pressure, because there were some pretty big environmental groups that said we need to do this or else. If the petroleum companies had all of these new technologies and their engineers didn't think that they needed to move out of fossil fuels then they would ignore the whole situation. But because these environmental groups had put the pressure on them to do something that made them more competitive, it enabled a new market for this technology. So if the market grows a little bit and that grows the number of plants that are making it then it gets cheaper. That makes the price of this renewable energy product go down. Then people start to use it and it goes viral. And that's what we need to see happen with biodiesel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKWJtg21Zqw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csj0ZW28pw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3JyUx_bQ2A&t=62s&ab_channel=ScienceWorld\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/biodiesel.htm", "num_tokens_generated": 775, "OGF": 0.189208984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 17.448344230651855, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 185, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

In this report we are going to discuss just how technology is beneficial to human beings. It is of the utmost importance to state right away, before we begin to answer the questions, that the benefits discussed in this report will have absolutely nothing to do with how it has effected human beings. Though technology has effected human beings, this paper will only be discussing the benefits of the technology used, no matter how negative it has been to humanity itself. This report will also explain how it can benefit the world as well. II. Is Technology Beneficial to the World? Technology has been a staple of the human race for as long as we have existed, as well as for the entirety of our history. There have also been a lot of benefits to technology as we have learned to use it and advance it. These technological advances have made everyday life easier for human beings by enabling us to do things quicker and much more effective than what would be possible or practical without it. Whether people wish to admit it, technology helps to make human lives substantially better than they normally would be. Without it, people can expect to live miserable lives without modern comforts. But how does it make life easier? It is, after all, quite complicated. One of the benefits of technology is the fact that it makes communicating so much easier compared to what would be possible without it, especially before the Internet or smart devices. It also, in most cases, makes tasks that would take an immense amount of time, much quicker, as well as much more accurate compared to would be possible without modern technology. These things do not only benefit humanity as a whole, but also people on a personal level. If you can imagine living in a society that didn\u2019t have technology, not only would it be more dangerous because most equipment requires it to function, but it also simply makes life more difficult. For example, it would be near impossible to keep track of everything that is going on in a person\u2019s life without the assistance that technology provides them, such as a phone, computers, or even just simple things like social media apps that allow you to communicate with the rest of the world. It is almost impossible to deny that technology in today\u2019 s world is as is as important to people as eyas immo", "num_tokens_generated": 4159, "OGF": 1.015380859375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 104.32613015174866, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 186, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

As you continue to develop your strategic thinking skills, you will find that you begin to apply this knowledge instinctively while solving day-to-day problems. This week, you will complete our SWOT Analysis assignment. In addition, you will complete a discussion board about organizational goals and the role of information systems in strategy development.\nMBA 600: Managing Information for Strategic Advantage is based on the premise that effective information management capabilities and the information systems (IS) environment in general are enablers that can be leveraged to help improve operations and competitive strategies. In this course, we define strategy as the way that a firm develops its competencies and systems to provide a superior value proposition to the firm\u2019s clients. The mission and vision statements are the basis of the strategy for the firm and provide a guidepost to the actions that must be taken. In developing the vision, the strategic-thinking principles outlined by Tesla\u2019s John Hagel III must be considered. The vision has the characteristics of the distant future and the near future.\nThe assignment is designed to offer practice and to help you understand how organizations use SWOT and other analysis tools to develop information systems strategies. These strategies influence many aspects of a firm\u2019s operation. The assignment also tests your grasp of key aspects of IS strategy development for a firm.\nSWOT Analysis Instructions\nCreate and fill out a SWOT Analysis for a new IS strategy.\nThe mission statement of the firm should be used to drive the discussion. Referring to the materials for this class and the firm selected:\nIdentify and fill in the SWOT using the template provided.\nDetermine the appropriate focus of an IT strategy, based on the material provided and the SWOT.\nAssess the IS strategy choices and determine one key strategy.\nSelect a new IS strategy by answering the following questions:\nBased on your analysis of the SWOT, what is the most viable IS strategy? Why?\nBased on your understanding of the mission, what are your two key strategies? Why? What is the relationship between these strategies? How might you combine these strategies to produce a more powerful IS strategy?\nBased on your strategies, create a new firm Vision that incorporates your SWOT analysis and two key strategies.\nBesides the SWOT Analysis, what other information can be useful to understanding how the firm makes its final information systems strategic decisions? How does this relate to the competitive advantage?\nCreate a 5- to 7-page report in Word format. Apply APA standards to cite appropriately.\nClick here to see the sample swot analysis.\nThis week, we will focus on creating an information system strategy focused on achieving the goals within the new vision.

When people are stressed and worried, this can lead to increased consumption of alcohol or other drugs, increasing the risk of dependence, or relapse into drug use if a patient is currently in recovery. In some countries, governments have intervened to protect addicts from crime.\nIn 1971, a federal court in the US ruled that an addict must be treated as \u201cphysically unable\u201d to break the law. That means he is exempt from punishment under federal law if he breaks the prohibition. In some cases, medical staff administer methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic, that is used for treatment of opiate dependence.\nIt is illegal to prescribe it without a license, however, because the drug is highly addictive and the risk of addiction is too high. In some countries, including the UK and the US, it is illegal to prescribe drugs to addicts or drug users. In the US, methadone prescriptions are allowed only if an addict has been detoxified from their first, often self-prescribed, addictive drug, by a doctor before they are prescribed methadone. For the vast majority of cases, this is not required, however, so for many drug users, methadone is an \u201cillegal high\u201d or an illegal drug addiction, rather than an addiction that requires treatment. A doctor or pharmacist can decide to prescribe methadone despite the fact that the patient might not be addicted to the drug if the doctor or pharmacist knows and has had experience with the patient.\nBecause the FDA, like almost all countries, is a \u201clicensed medical supply company\u201d, it is legally responsible for testing products before their approval. However, it also gives doctors, pharmacists and other health care professionals licenses to prescribe drugs that are legally in their possession. For example, prescribing opioids by \u201cauthorization\u201d does not require approval of a prescription by the FDA or any other regulatory body, but there may be other laws requiring approval.\nThe law is that the doctor (or another health care professional who prescribes the drug) cannot knowingly obtain one, prescribe or use a controlled substance under conditions that would require the patient to ingest the drug or use it to commit a crime. The law is also that a drug that is used for a medical treatment (for which no other treatment is possible) is a controlled substance, unless it is a drug that is used solely for purposes of addiction treatment.\nThe main difference between these two types of drugs is that controlled substances tend to cause a state of euphoria. It is generally understood that if a person uses a drug to achieve a euphoric state, it will produce positive effects of that state. But this does not apply to marijuana and other synthetic drugs, which produce euphoria, but can also cause problems with the use of other drugs. For example, people who take marijuana may also use alcohol and other substances that cause euphoria (and possibly intoxication) in the short term.\nLaw enforcement can also be part of the conflict, as it has sometimes prosecuted people who violate these laws (for example, by the use of controlled substances without permission from their physician). Criminal penalties, fines and fines or other punishment are also a part of the conflict.\nBut the main purpose of these laws is to prevent the use of a drug. For many drug users, substance use as such is an offense, and it is usually punished. In some countries, this punishment includes arrest and imprisonment.\nThe law may not be intended to stop people from using substances for recreation, such as recreational use of alcohol and other drugs, but usually does not prevent people who use prescription medications legally (e.\nBenzos can be used on the street because it is legal, but it is a bit difficult to find someone to prescribe because there is no official list of doctors who prescribe benzos. The only way one can find a list of approved prescribing doctors by state (like a physician in Canada) is by searching for a physician in that state. This list will likely include multiple countries, but may only include one state or one part of a state. In my opinion, the best bet for finding a doctor willing to treat someone in need of an antidepressant is to use an online search engine (i.e., ask.fm.es).\nIn many of these countries, prescription drug availability is at best moderately available, so, prescriptions are often very easy to obtain. Some states do not require prescribing of an antidepressant to someone with a diagnosis of depression, while in other states, a doctor is licensed to prescribe an antidepressant to a depressed patient (i.e. someone with a history of drug use of any kind) if they are unable to treat their symptoms on their own.\nIn states that require prescribing to a patient who is ineligible for treatment, however, pharmaceutical companies can offer discount treatment in exchange for their involvement in such treatment. In many states, pharmaceutical companies also offer a discount for drugs they sell to patients that are prescribed as necessary to treat other medical conditions.\nCategories of drugs\nAmphetamines stimulants\nMethamphetamine stimulants\nCocaine euphoric; analgesic\nKetamine an anesthetic\nKetamine sedative\nDimethyltryptamine (DMT) psychedelic\nHeroin heroin, morphine euphoric\nCocaine stimulant, stimulant", "num_tokens_generated": 1323, "OGF": 0.322998046875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 30.372564792633057, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 191, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

I was going to do it on the topic of animal experimentation, but instead I did it on the topics of animal testing and the ethics and safety of animal testing. I will go more in-depth into my argument in this essay than what I did in the above essay. My audience was animal testing experts and those involved in animal testing, but my message wasn't just for them. I tried to use examples of companies that had to stop and discontinue their products due to animal testing and other examples of companies that did decide to stop animal testing. I want to get the message through to other people as well. This essay is very short, I was very strict in word limits. I had a hard time trying to keep everything in there and not make it too rushed or too long for any part. The title is pretty effective, I think it relates right to topic, I'll explain it again really briefly. I tried to convince the reader to not accept this type of testing and not use animals as an experiment. Instead use some other method and explain how it works. The reason they use animals is simple they are easy to obtain and do not require much testing before experimenting. It's just not ethical. In the end I would like to find a solution to this topic some day.\nArgumentative Essay 2006-10-11\nDiscuss the main ethical debate over the use of animals to test for medical research. To what extent is the medical advancement beneficial to human beings? What does this mean for animals used to test for medical advancements? \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other.\" As stated by the Animal Liberation Foundation, (2006) the use of animal testing to help test medicines and procedures to help better and improve humans is very important to medicine and animal rights are important as well. Since we don't have the ability to test on humans for many reasons, animals must be used in many experiments. This essay will look into the different perspectives on this and why they feel the other side is wrong. This essay has two main sides, using animals for testing and the other side is not using animals for testing. \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other.\" As stated by the Animal Liberation Foundation, (2006) the use of animal testing to help test medicines and procedures to help better and improve humans is very important to medicine and animal rights in humans also. I will look into the different perspectives of this and why they feel the other side is wrong. This essay has two main sides, using animals for testing and the other side is not using animals for testing. For this paper the research was used to find the differences in research and why the other method is a better and more effective way to test on. Many people are against testing on animals. Some argue that using animals for research and testing is wrong in many circumstances; they feel that it is not ethical and it is cruel to the animals. They feel that even if it may help the human race, it is still wrong to do it because the animals cannot speak and voice their opinion and they think that by using them they are taking away the natural lives of animals. With the medical advancements that the animals are used for, a side with animals states that animal testing is not benefitting the animal and it is not helping the animals because they cannot voice their opinion on how they feel. Using animals as testing may lead to their death, some may even die from the lack of a cure for them because it was never found due to the animals not being able to voice their opinion. Many people support animal testing and believe that it is ethical to use animals. They feel that even if they may die it is still important to use the animals because they save the lives of many other animals and humans. Some feel that the humans and animals may have less of a chance of advancing without using the animals if they can't receive a cure from their death. They feel that without animal testing it would take even longer for the medical advancements and the cures that are found. Others side with the humans and feel that humans are more significant to the medical advancements because they are the top of the food chain and they don't believe that animals are more important than them. This essay will cover the two arguments for and against using animals for testing. Many people are against testing on animals.

The main argument in this is that the animals cannot voice their opinion, and that even if they may test on the animals they feel that it's not ethical to do so because the could be hurting the animals and taking away their natural lives by using them. \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other.\" People that are against using animals think that it is not ethical to do so. Many people may not understand this because humans can voice their opinion but the animals cannot they have no way to voice and to tell what they think about what is going on the process and how it may harm them. If animals had a voice then this debate about animal testing would be different and more of a debate. They do think that animals are worth it and if there death will be able to help humans and others with the problem that may be causing their death the side that supports using animals will take that way of thinking. The side that thinks it's wrong to use the animals thinks that no matter how the outcome would it be wrong to do it and the end result will be no good and it really wouldn't be right to help the humans. They feel that it would be wrong to cause animals to suffer for the sake of a medicine. Many of them say that animals have the right to live and to have a choice on how they want to live their lives. They feel that they have rights also and it would be wrong to take them if the animals cannot speak for themselves. Many of them say that animals have the right to live and to have a choice on how they want to live their lives. They feel that they have rights also and it would be wrong to take them if the animals cannot speak for themselves. The other side of this argument is that animals have a natural life that they were born to live and it is right for those to live their natural lives because they have given them everything and they don't deserve to be taken from their home to be used for something that could harm them and they wouldn't like that way of living. They would not voice their opinion on the situation because they don't understand and wouldn't be able to communicate it. Even though some do try and some of things are understood there are still many things that they do not know about and don't need to know about. I would like to take this side because the animals don't have the ability to communicate and do not know what goes on around them, they do not know the differences in the different things that are important such as ethics and animal rights. I feel that no matter what there may be a few things that they understand and can communicate by but this is not the case on most of the things that go on in these animals life. I feel that there is so much that the animals don't know about and have no way or the ability to tell the people about anything that they went through. These animals would not be able to understand anything and just like any other person they do not know the difference between right and wrong. They would need to be able to use their natural rights and be able to speak their mind, this is something only humans are able to do and why humans have a higher status. In this essay I would like to debate and prove that it does not matter if the animals voice their opinion or not because they still shouldn't be used for medical advancements. I would like to find solutions and ideas to this so that the ethics will not be hurt and the animals will be left to live their natural lives as they were born too. Even though many people disagree about using the animals they all have their own valid opinions on the situation. I feel that no matter how anyone feels and what they say it is wrong for them to use any animal and take their natural rights to be able to live their natural lives without being experimented with or taken away from their home. The animals have rights and they should not interfere with them at any circumstance and it is simply wrong and cruel to do so. The animals are very important to the medical advancements that have helped humans and the many discoveries that have been made but I feel that they still have the right to their natural lives and it is wrong to mess around with that. This is why some tests are done in labs or in a sterile environment and the animals are kept away from the others. These animals deserve a life that is not full of drugs and fear. They have to be tested to find out what the medicines will do to them. If it was going to harm them they are not going to test it on them and I feel that this is not right and is unethical. I feel that many of the animals are not even capable of understanding many of the things that happen to many of them. This is another reason why the animals should not be used in testing as many of them don't even care about it and wouldn't even be able to know what they are doing it for. Many of the animals live a life that they are not really a part of and have no concept of it at all. This is why I think that the animals should not be used in medical testing of drugs and experiments to help humans and others; we cannot treat the animals unfairly like this and use them and have their lives ruined for it. \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other.\" This is another good point to show that it is important for the animals to continue to live how they were born to and not to take away their lives for our experimentation. We should not mess with nature and the animals and their right to naturally live their lives they were born too and not use them and hurt them for our own experiment. \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other,\" The people that take part in this are very selfish for messing with those that are innocent of all the things that go on and there lives are not their own and they are not able to tell us this. Many animals do not even know what we are testing on them for and they shouldn't be tested on if they don't know. It is important for them to live their lives and find their own way rather than be taken from their home and kept in a situation in which they don't belong in or have any clue about. Even though using animals for testing and experimentation I believe that it is not cruel to use them anymore. Even though I feel that this is wrong and cruel in many cases I still don't feel that it is the most cruel action to be taken and that something else is worse. It is not like the animals were born to live there own lives that way and many of them don't even know what's going on so they can not even help. I'm sure many of them just go and live their own lives and have no concept of what is going on and even if they do then I'm sure they would agree to be tested on for medicines and experimentation. I believe that it is important for the animals to naturally live their lives and not take away their rights just so we can further with our medical advancements and experiments on drugs and medicines. \"Albert Einstein is reported to have said that compassion is contagious, kindness spreads. Unfortunately, cruelty and suffering have their own contagious quality and often spread faster than the other,\" I feel that even if it would be cruel for people to harm the animals, there is something more cruel and it's more against the rules of ethics. I believe that the animals should be able to live the life that they were born too. Many of these animals deserve the right to live their natural lives, that was what their born and raised to do and if this is taken away from them and messed with than the animals don't really have their own lives at all. I'm sure that many of the animals wouldn't agree to being used because it is not the way they were born to think. They don't know what is going on and they probably do not even care and just live their own lives, without the experimentation of medicines and things like that. If they had the choice they would probably not want to give up their lives and rights to do this even for a better cause. This is why I feel that the animals should not be experimented or tested on for human and medical advancements in science, they deserve to live there own lives and be set free from the experimentation and testing.\nEssay on Animal testing\nEthical issues - are animals used more in research than humans?\n100 word essay on animal testing\nEthical Issues With Animal Testing\nHow to Write a Persuasive Speech Against Animal Testing\nPersuasive Essay against Animal Testing\nArgument for Animal Testing\nAnimal Testing Is Important because\nEssays about Animals.

In 1897, it was estimated that nearly 16 million cattle died from hoof-and-mouth disease, which quickly spread the epidemic throughout Europe. Because these millions of cattle died from one disease, the price of butter and beef quickly shot up, and many people were forced to eat more eggs.\nHowever, chickens still died as a result of this outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease, which was later contained with the help of antibiotics. Chicken is a lean meat and it can be a healthy choice because it provides protein without being packed with saturated fat.\nA pound of chicken breast has just over 100 calories and 38 grams of protein. As for saturated fat content, a pound of chicken breast is just under 2 grams. However, you must consume the meat in moderation if you want to keep your heart healthy.\nChicken breast fat content\nThe chicken breast is the main source of chicken meat and contains between 6% and 10% fat and is considered lean meat. The meat is usually sold deboned and skinless and comes mainly from broilers.\nThe lower fat content of chicken breast makes it an ideal cut for many people and it is considered to be richer in protein than other kinds of meat.\nChicken breast fat percentage\nFor example, a serving of chicken breast breast has about 100 calories. The total fat content of 35 grams is approximately 28 grams, most of which are unsaturated fats. The amount of saturated fat per serving is about 6 grams.\nIf you want to cut back on saturated fat, you should always buy skinless chicken and choose white meat over dark meat.\nIf you are trying to lose weight, it is also a good idea to try to reduce your intake of saturated fat while increasing your intake of protein.\nThere is a lot of confusion between fats and cholesterol in the foods we eat. While the two work hand in hand to transport vitamins and help us use energy, they also play an equally important role in inflammation and the development of chronic conditions, like heart attacks and strokes.\nWhen it comes to our health, we generally categorize fats into good fats and bad fats, the latter of which is also known as bad cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol. The high cholesterol levels associated with unhealthy lifestyle choices may be a contributing factor to the development of heart disease.\nThe role of healthy fats\nThe two types of foods that contain good fats are plant fats and animal fats. When it comes to our overall health, foods that contain healthy fats are considered good sources of energy and help our bodies absorb vitamins and minerals. They also help our bodies use energy from our food and keep us feeling full.\nFats that help the body maintain hormone levels are called essential fats, such as Omega-3. These essential fats are important for healthy living and are vital for bone development and the health of our skin and organs.\nOur body can synthesize essential fatty acids from omega-3 in our diets, but we get them from seafood and some plant-based foods, such as olive oil.\nAs you probably know, fats can have positive and negative effects on our health. Eating foods that are high in saturated fats and trans fats is linked to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and depression, while unsaturated fats help to maintain a healthy heart.\nHealthy Fats for Weight Loss and Good Health\nThe type of fats (or the amount) we consume does matter. Research shows that too much added fat, especially unhealthy fats like trans fats and sugar-sweetened drinks, can lead to weight gain and other adverse health risks such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\nThe best way to reduce your risk is to cut down on saturated fats and replace them with unsaturated fats (mainly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats). These are found in oils from plants such as sunflower, olive and rapeseed. Foods high in unsaturated fats include, but are not limited to avocado, salmon, walnuts and sunflower seeds.\nIn a large bowl, mix ground chicken, egg, breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup chopped parsley, 1/3 cup chopped basil, 1/2 cup Asiago cheese, 1 tablespoon oil, salt, pepper, and 1/2 cup water. In the same bowl, mix panko and 1/2 tablespoon oil. Prepare one tray at a time for both batters. Pour the chicken mixture into the pan and press it firmly in the pan on one side, flip the other side with the panko mixture to form a crust. Repeat this process with the remaining egg mixture, one tray at a time. Arrange the chicken strips in a single layer on a rack fitted in a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until a thermometer reads 165 degrees, about 12 minutes. Serve with marinara sauce. Suggested garnish: toasted pine nuts.\nPope\u2019s chicken is considered the top seller on a recent list of fast-food favorites. You probably recognize it as Chick-fil-A, a restaurant chain known for the branding of its flagship sandwiches, the Pope\u2019s chicken and the Double Chicken sandwich.\nAs they\u2019ve grown, Chick-fil-A has used the Pope\u2019s chicken name to capitalize on the appeal of their burgers and nuggets.\nHow Much Fat Is in Chick-fil-A Pope\u2019s Chicken?\nThe Pope\u2019s chicken contains about 39 grams of saturated fat and has a total fat content of 21 grams. With less than one gram of saturated fat and 4 grams of sugar, the Pope\u2019s chicken sandwich contains around 11 grams of added fat, according to Fast Food Data.\nFor comparison, a healthy fast food burger has less than half that amount of fat, at 2 grams of saturated and less than 1 gram of trans fats.\nIn fact, the double chicken sandwich has about 6 grams of saturated fat.\nYou could easily replace the Pope\u2019s chicken with any of these healthy alternatives, such as a chicken salad. If you\u2019ve got a taste for something a little more spicy, the Pope\u2019s chicken could be a good option.\nDo they have Pope\u2019s chicken at Popeyes?\nPope\u2019s Chicken is a fried chicken sandwich, but the Popeyes sandwich is basically the Pope\u2019s sandwich with fries and a biscuit. The Popeye\u2019s sauce is served on the side in 2, 1-cup sauce packets. And the chicken is fried in corn oil.\nHow big is the Pope\u2019s chicken?\nThe chicken sandwich is also larger than the usual McDonald\u2019s sandwich. But if Popeyes were to bring back the Pope\u2019s sandwich, you could have a large sandwich. Now that Popeyes has done what it did with the chicken sandwich, I think we should be able to have a large sandwich.\nHow many calories are in Pope\u2019s chicken?\nIn 4 oz. of Pope\u2019s Chicken, you get 11 grams of protein and 9 grams of fat. So what about the chicken itself? While 100 calories from Pope\u2019s Chicken is about 2.1 calories per ounce, it\u2019s about 3 calories per ounce for Popeyes.\nIn short, it\u2019s the same as for chicken at other fast food restaurants, such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken. There\u2019s no difference between Pope\u2019s Chicken and Popeyes Chicken.\nHow long does Pope\u2019s chicken last in the fridge?\nI have had an issue with Pope\u2019s chicken. I\u2019ve been in the same spot for a few days, and the bottom half of the chicken is still intact. I\u2019ve been storing it in the freezer because I like to make grilled chicken on the BBQ. But I\u2019ve been keeping it in a storage bag because I\u2019ve been freezing it in the fridge. I\u2019ve done this at least three times in the past month, and this is now the fourth. As of yesterday, I noticed that the bottom half of the chicken is still intact. I\u2019ve had the same sandwich on my menu now for over two years. I have had the same sandwich on my menu for approximately 1 year. I\u2019ve had the same sandwich on my menu for approximately two years. It has been the same since I bought the first one 11 years ago; it\u2019s been the same since I bought the second one 3 years ago; it\u2019s been the same since I bought the third one 4 years ago; it\u2019s been the same since I bought the fourth one 4 years ago.\nHow many calories are in Pope\u2019s sandwich?\nPope\u2019s sandwich does not contain a lot of calories, and is probably more of a side salad. It\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always eaten chicken, and it\u2019s a great alternative.\nIs Pope\u2019s chicken healthy?\nThat all depends on the specific item, but in general, Pope\u2019s chicken is likely to have more calories and more fat than you would expect. I know this because Pope\u2019s does not list calories, fat or carbs on its product labels, and it can be quite difficult to determine what\u2019s in their food without a nutrition label. I think it\u2019s safe to say that most Pope\u2019s chicken is not healthy. We get a lot of Pope\u2019s chicken in my household, too, and I can\u2019t say that I can ever consider them healthy. And I\u2019m not even a big Pope\u2019s chicken fan. I have a hard enough time believing that the Pope\u2019s chicken is really healthy, that it has the same nutritional qualities as McDonald\u2019s, KFC, etc. but I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to buy Pope\u2019s chicken and try to do it with my own money. Yes, Pope\u2019s chicken is healthier than a lot of fast food.\nWhat\u2019s not to like about Pope\u2019s chicken?\nPope\u2019s chicken has always been a favorite of mine, but for some reason I\u2019ve been trying to avoid buying it. They have always been too cheap to charge me, maybe I didn\u2019t know that you couldn\u2019t buy it for less than $4.25. Plus since you have to buy it in bulk to get the Pope\u2019s chicken for $3.39 at most of Pope\u2019s chicken, there are a lot of people who don\u2019t know they can buy Pope\u2019s chicken for $2.29 a piece.\nPopeyes, KFC, and Chick-fil-A are a few restaurants that you can find out here, but some fast food places also have their own Pope\u2019s chicken items.\nChicken and Waffles vs chicken and biscuits\nChicken and biscuits? So you can tell the difference between chicken and biscuit, right? This is a classic recipe and it\u2019s a classic dish for our friends and family to gather around at the table for every meal. If you want to make the whole dish that you want, you\u2019ll need the chicken, 1/2 cup of biscuit dough (mix water, flour, salt, and baking powder until the dough is soft), and 1/4 cup butter mixed with 1/4 cup oil until the butter and oil are evenly distributed throughout the cooked biscuits. The biscuits are perfect for a big feat for your family and for those who prefer biscuits over pies.\nIf you are in the mood for chicken and biscuit, you should know that there are many different recipes out there, and this is one of the most popular ones.\nChicken and waffles are two different ways of making this recipe. Chicken can be grumbled, steamed, or boiled. Biscuit, on the other hand, can be baked into waffles, as well as crisped. One of the most popular recipes for waffles is chicken and biscuit.\nThe easiest way to make chicken and biscuit in a restaurant is by making the biscuit. You can do that with your hands, or pour the ingredients into a container and use a mixer to stir everything up.\nChicken and biscuits are very similar, except that you can make waffles. This recipe has a great variation of both biscuit and waffles, and it can make many different types of waffles.\nPope\u2019s recipe is very good and it\u2019s not as sweet as other recipes, but is it really that simple? If so, why not make your own biscuits and chicken? The biscuit and chicken recipe has already been listed in the above list of our favorite restaurant recipes.\nYou can also find other recipes here.\nHere are some more biscuits for you to browse!\nWhy are you eating fast food?\nIt\u2019s very simple actually. The chicken sandwich contains a number of addictive ingredients and it also contains a large amount of salt and sugar. A chicken sandwich is very high in saturated fat, which is a major contributor to heart disease, and the sandwich contains large amounts of sodium (about 1,800 mg) and about 35% of the daily fiber (12 grams).\nIf you are a fast food consumer and want to eat healthier, it is best to consider eating fast food as a lifestyle change rather than as an occasional indulgence. After all, it is a convenient meal that is available in a fast food restaurant 24 hours a day. By making some healthy food choices as part of your lifestyle, you will be able to reduce your intake of saturated fat and also the amount of sugar.\nFor more information on healthy eating, see Healthy Food Choices for Everyone (USDA) and How to Eat Healthy (Mayo Clinic).\nChick fil a pope\u2019s chicken\nIt\u2019s all about the crispy, crusty outside and the tender meat inside.\nWhen it comes to chicken sandwiches, many of us are obsessed. I mean, what\u2019s not to love about a crispy, crusty exterior? The crispy exterior gives the tender meat an extra crunch. It\u2019s kind of like a biscuit and a bagel.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. I mean, there are no biscuits and buns on the menu, and they can\u2019t be made at home. Right?\nWell, not quite, there\u2019s another way to get your fix of crispy chicken. Chick-fil-A, which is the biggest American fast-food restaurant chain, has the answer.\nPope\u2019s chicken is an American original. It first opened its doors in 1945 in Atlanta, Georgia, before spreading like wildfire.\nThe restaurant chain has over 200 locations throughout the United States, and it is the largest fast-food chain in the world. While Pope\u2019s is most well-known for its signature chicken sandwich, it is also known for its fried chicken and steak sandwiches, as well as its chicken nuggets (which can only be found at Pope\u2019s locations in the South).\nBut Pope\u2019s chicken isn\u2019t just about chicken. They serve other sandwiches like hot dogs and cheeseburgers, and they also have chicken tenders (fingers of breaded fried chicken).\nSo yes, Pope\u2019s chicken is a bit of a chicken-based sandwich, but it is still a good option to try some other protein options.\nI love that Pope\u2019s is so creative. There\u2019s so many different varieties, like a classic sandwich, a hot dog, or a cheeseburger. The only thing that I missed was the fried chicken I have always loved, but Pope\u2019s offers an oven-baked (but you do not get a grilled option) version called the Golden Fry.\nThe reason most fast food restaurants have chicken sandwiches on their menu is because people want chicken. The Pope\u2019s sandwich is a classic because it is a quick and easy sandwich that most people know and love.\nThe Pope\u2019s sandwich is very similar to the classic McDonald\u2019s\nWhich country eats more chicken?\nWhat is Popeyes new sandwich?\nHow many calories do Popeyes chicken tenders have?\nIs Popeyes sandwich any good?\nIf you\u2019re into Popeyes sandwiches, try picking up some Popeyes on Saturdays. You can order Popeyes sandwiches online as well as get them delivered to your home. If you\u2019re ordering Popeyes on Saturday, you\u2019ll get a free Popeyes sandwich. What\u2019s a Popeyes sandwich, you ask\nTagged chicken pope's, pope's chicken, pope's chicken calories, review&\nHow To Add Focus To A Portrait\nCan I Get Custody Of My Daughter\nHow Many Carbs In Fried Chicken \u2013 How Many", "num_tokens_generated": 4043, "OGF": 0.987060546875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 101.22110557556152, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 194, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

METHODS: In a crossover design, elite 18- to 20-yearold male athletes completed two resistance training (RT) and two resistance and cardiorespiratory (CR) exercise sessions per week for eight weeks in an acute phase of HIIT versus matched aerobic interval training of the same time and intensity. Exercise was performed in two separate supervised aerobic workouts. The intensity (VO2 r max), volume (kilograms), and type (resistance, RT; or resistance and cardiorespiratory, CR) of exercise chosen at baseline and following the acute phase determined the type and sequence of exercise for the 8-week period. This was followed by two further phases, a post-acute resistance and aerobic training to determine post-testing effects of a combined, resistance and cardiorespiratory training program. RESULTS: The RT group increased 1RM by 25%, and the CR group by 15% whereas no such increase in RT or CR performance was seen in the HIIT group. No statistically significant changes in VO2 max and Vmax-k cal/min were observed in either group although the CR group had the greatest improvement in the work efficiency ratio (from 1.5 to 1.7). No safety concerns were observed during these protocols. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of an RT program was established in our selected athletes. The CR training program was too intensive for our athletes so they were unable to attain the required training volume of 40--50 minutes of training per week. However, the aerobic and resistance training was similar in terms of the total training stimulus (volume: 408 minutes versus 414 minutes; intensity: 75% VO2 r max versus 75% VO2 max ). In light of recent research into the effects of combined aerobic and strength training and the relatively low number of athletes who use RT programs for fitness and performance enhancement, our findings suggest that aerobic training alone (or combined with CR training) is sufficient to deliver a considerable training stimulus and result in significant increases in strength and power.

On day 5-6, subjects completed a hot, 750 W cycling test, before each protocol. HA led to greater Tsk at 12 days (study 1: p<0.05 and 10 days (study 2: p<0.01; no change in Trec skin temperature was detected (no p>.40. Furthermore, attenuation in resting cardiovascular responses during 750 W cycling was noted. However, no improvement was noted in SV, TPR nor CI variables during either 30 or 750 W cycling in either study. We conclude that a 10 or 15 HA protocol did not ameliorate resting cardiovascular or thermoregulatory variables during either moderate or high intensity exercise.\nChallenge and response to training: effects of mental imagery.\nKalakuta, P P; Troy, D S; Greenleaf, J E\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of mental imagery combined with actual exercise experience and actual exercise experience alone. Subjects were 24 male college freshman selected for their fitness, aerobic capacity, weight, and age. They were assigned to the imagery (n = 12) or exercise (n = 12) group. This study was double-blind and counterbalanced within each subject. A battery of testing began on the first day of training with the subjects tested for maximal oxygen uptake, submaximal maximal oxygen uptake, and performance of a 3-repetition maximal 2-leg squat (1 min rest between repetitions). Two to 60 seconds before each squat exercise, a mental imagery of fatigue (negative imagery) was practiced by visualization, audition, and kinesthetic sensation. One minute rest followed before testing for repetitions could be achieved. This protocol was utilized during training. All other testing was performed as in the first session. These tests were 1) maximal oxygen uptake (running on a treadmill), 2) submaximal maximal oxygen uptake (running on a treadmill at 65% maximum aerobic power), and 3) strength (3 repetition maximal 2-legged squat). These tests were pre-trained for six weeks with and without either the negative imagery or positive imagery and were tested for maximal aerobic power, submaximal maximal aerobic power, and maximum power. Training revealed no marked improvement with either group. Pre-training mental imagery for strength tests showed no significant difference, and negative imagery resulted in improvement in one variable, the squat test in the mental imagery group. At pre-training for oxygen uptake 65% to maximal oxygen uptake and strength 1 repetition maximal, there was no significant improvement. At pre-training for 3-repetition maximal squat 2-legged exercise, there was an improvement in squat 3RM, but no other variable improved. There was a significant improvement in squat 3RM in the mental imagery group during\nElectroacupuncture increases antioxidant enzyme activities in lipopolysaccharide-treated male rats.\nWang, Chang-Yu; Chen, Hong-Quan; Tao, Dan-Dan; Wu, Fai-Wong; Feng, Hsiu-Chih; Gao, Wen-Lan; Kung, Po-Jang; Chung, Liang-Jen\nThe activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase (GSH-R) were evaluated in the liver and kidney of rats treated with electroacupuncture (EA), a traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. EA was performed to improve the body's immune function. Our study included four experimental groups, i.e., the two EA groups and the two control groups (PBS, no LPS or LPS, no EA). No significant differences in body weight were observed between the experimental groups. The activities of SOD (16.70\u00c2\u00b11.73 versus 18.35\u00c2\u00b13.69 IU/g \u00c2\u00b7 min; P=0.364) and GSH-R (0.555\u00c2\u00b10.069 versus 0.641\u00c2\u00b10.073\u00e2\u20ac\u2026nmol/tissue/120\u00e2\u20ac\u2026s; P=0.792) were not significantly affected in the liver and kidney tissues of rats in any of the experimental groups. However, an increase in GSH-R activity in the liver of rats in the LPS+EA group (0.614\u00c2\u00b10.034) was observed, whereas there was a decrease in GSH-R activity in the liver of rats in the LPS+LPS group (0.540\u00c2\u00b10.068, P=0.015). An increase in SOD activity in the kidney of rats in the LPS+EA group (18.57\u00c2\u00b11.25\u00e2\u20ac\u2026IU/g \u00c2\u00b7 min) was also observed. There were no statistically significant differences in the bodyweight gain of the experimental rats in EAc, LPS+LPSAc, and EAc+LPSr groups within a single training day, but the changes in bodyweight gain were significantly different among the four groups of rats. This study suggested that EA improved immunity and decreased lipid peroxidation in the liver of LPS-treated male rats.\nThe Effects of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) on VO2 Max, Cardio Endurance, Muscular Strength, and Flexibility in Young Volleyball Men\nMohammad Reza Nikbakht\nFull Text Available Objectives: The purpose of this study is the investigation of the effect of high intensity interval training (HIIT on VO2 max, cardio endurances, muscular strength and flexibility of youth volleyball men.Methods: This study was an interventional study with pre and post-test design and control group. 30 volleyball men who performed high intensity interval training (3 weekly sessions, 10 weeks participated in this study.

Results:The mean VO2 max, cardio endurances, muscular strength and flexibility increased among the participants. There was not statistically differences in the VO2 max, cardio endurances, muscular strength and flexibility among the groups. Conclusion: HIIT is more appropriate in improving aerobic power and explosive ability in young male and the program recommended for the coaches that if you are looking to increase physicality and speed in volleyball, make a program based on HIIT for improving aerobic power and explosive ability.\nEffect of short-term aerobic interval training on muscle blood flow during cycling in trained sprinters\nTherkelsen, Mads H.; Aagaard, Per; Beelen, Mark; Kiens, Bente\nThe muscle blood flow (mBF) response during incremental cycling was examined in 34 trained/competitive sprinters (33\u00e2\u20ac\u201835 years old, n = 18) before and after 8 weeks of interval training on the basis of the incremental load \u00e2\u20ac\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u201a x mBF/heart rate achieved during the last 5 min of an\nBilateral and Unilateral Electromyostimulation Training During a 20-Min High-Intensity Cycle Exercise Program\nFull Text Available Background: It is important to understand the effect of training and exercise intensity, type of exercise, and electromyostimulation (EMG training (ET protocols on the response in muscle activity and performance of sportsmen during high-intensity exercise and also to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying sports performance. Materials and Methods: Fifteen elite male badminton players (mean age 22 \u00c2\u00b1 2 years, stature 180.04 \u00c2\u00b1 6.0 cm; body weight 71.59 \u00c2\u00b1 7.4 kg participated in this study. The training program was designed as a progressive unilateral stepwise cycle ergometer exercise (20-min sessions. A second exercise and training session was done using the identical exercise protocol on the contralateral side. During one session, both legs were tested to observe the effects of single-leg EMG training (ET. The ET group, 5 sessions in a week, for 6 weeks performed quadriceps exercises (90% of maximum voluntary EMG. The control (CON group, 7 sessions, for 6 weeks performed standard aerobic exercise sessions. After the exercise sessions were completed, the muscle activity of the rectus femoris (RF was measured by a linear encoder. Result: The results demonstrated significant improvements in both groups in muscle strength and performance as well as significant reductions in heart rate and blood lactate levels following the completion of ET. However, there was no additional benefit to performing ET unilaterally after a single-leg exercise protocol. Conclusion: Based on this study, we suggest that it is beneficial to perform ET during exercise.\nAerobic Capacity Improvements with 3 vs 12 Months of High Intensity Interval Training.\nAtherton, Philip J; Murgatroyd, Cary L; Battin, Richard L; Peake, Jonathan M; Hargreaves, Mark; Hawley, John; Burke, Louise M; Cureton, Keith J; Petherick, Helen S\nThere is a paucity of data on the comparative effectiveness of interval training strategies targeting 3 vs 12 months of adaptation. We hypothesized that an equivalent level of adaptation/improvement in aerobic capacities could be obtained either after 3 or 12 months of high intensity interval training (HIIT), and that 3 months of HIIT is equally efficacious in comparison to more traditional endurance training. The study was divided into two phases, for 20 minutes per session (Phase 1: HIIT12, HIIT3, and CON HIIT12 groups trained for 1 and 3 months, respectively; CON HIIT3 group, n = 12, trained 3 times per week for 12 weeks; CON HIIT12 group, n = 19, trained 3 times per week for 12 months). We hypothesized that improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), time to exhaustion and peak respiratory exchange ratio (Peak RER) would not differ significantly. Participants completed 3 submaximal (50% VO(2max)) maximal-cycle exercise tests during Phase 1 and 3. VO(2max) was measured with an incremental cycle ergometer testing protocol at peak VO(2) (aerobic capacity assesment), time to exhaustion (aerobic capacity submaximal assessment) and Peak RER (aerobic capacity assessment). Improvements in VO(2max), time to exhaustion and Peak RER were not different between HIIT3 and HIIT12. However, HIIT3 vs HIIT12 group showed an increase in time to exhaustion (6.5 vs 4.2%, P HIIT protocols and traditional endurance training programs for 3 and 12 months respectively may be equally efficacious in improving aerobic capacities. This may be of importance in prescription of interval training for maximal and submaximal aerobic training adaptations.\nAn aerobic exercise to decrease low back pain among workers in office-based jobs with or at-risk for physical demand disabilities.\nColeman, Michael G; Wetz, Kathleen E; Goulart, Maria M; Chow, Joyce C; Vinciguerra, Megan M; Huber, Kristi M; Mehta, Ruchita; Smyers, Matthew L\nThe present investigation (1) identified a 10-week workplace ergonomic intervention designed to decrease low back pain (LBP) among adults who have or are at-risk for developing physical demand disabilities at work, and (2) examined the effects of an office-based exercise intervention compared with no intervention on pain and disability among workers with or at-risk for disabling LBP. Low back pain (LBP) presents a significant problem for the workplace. Although ergonomics have been shown to reduce LBP, they are not designed for long-term use. Thus, a workplace behavioral intervention approach was used to modify sedentary behaviors among adults with or at-risk for physical demand disabilities. A multi-site, matched-control trial with a sample of workers (N\u00c2 =\u00c2 132) was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different 10-week office exercise interventions: Exercise Intervention Group (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 64), and Control Intervention Group (n\u00c2 =\u00c2 68). The Exercise Intervention Group received 17-minute interval-based exercise breaks throughout the day. The Control Intervention Group was informed of the study findings, but no exercise recommendations were provided. Measures at baseline and the end of 10-weeks included a demographic report, an injury history report, and three versions of the Rapid Assessment of Disability (RAD) scale which included disability (sickness) component scores, pain/function ratio, self-rated disability, and pain intensity. Significant reductions were found in disability (sickness) component scores, and pain/function ratio among the Exercise Intervention Group compared with the Control Intervention Group. Significant improvements were found in pain/function ratio only among the Exercise Group. The present investigation identified an office-based ergonomics intervention designed to decrease LBP among adults with or at-risk for developing disabling LBP.\nEffect of low frequency and high intensity interval training on cycling time-trial performance in trained road cycling.\nMassimo Aze\u00c3\u00adtica: \u00c3\u0192\u00a3o 20% VO30 minutos de intervala\u00c3\u0192a \u00c3\u00a7a\u00c3\u00adtica (\u00c3\ufffdLTSS)Interval 46% VO2MAI (ModernAIS)Interval 70% VO2Max 2.8 minutos de intervala\u00c3\ufffdV\u00c3\ufffdV212 minutos de intervala\u00c3\u00a14-V0,3\u00c3\ufffd4V2MAT \u00c3\ufffd-V15 \u00c3\ufffdMax\u00c3\u00a5A\u00c3\ufffd4 \u00c3\ufffd5\u00c3\ufffd6\u00c3\ufffd\nShort duration high intensity sprint ( 162:10\u00c3\u00a41\u00c3\u20268 \u00c3\ufffd20%V0%1\u00c2\nExperimentos: \u00c3\ufffd60\u00c3\u00b80 15%V75\u00c3\ufffdTrial training in Brazilian\u00c2\u00c3\u20135%\n\u00c3\u00a9sthe exercise protocols/the most common and 4\u00e2\u20ac\u00bd209-141Vent studies:1 \u00c20\u00c3\u201cC3min\u00c3\ufffdof exercise at high intensity\u00c3\ufffd\ns, and high-V4455% intensity high145-10\u00c3\ufffdVigital2/high intensity and12-Very1-Aand6%intensity and2s high intensity/30/4 30and sity training.0.\nLow high intensity and6th intensity1Low intensity training/and intensity-L6110versions 10 high intensity exercise.1higher intensity trainer training.6s22intens- intensity/120sL0s157/training4intens intensity trainten intensity training vs.inten high90.\nversed intensity/of intensity training03intens/ training\nVs and low-0-1%40intens0.0\u00c20high intensity/7 intensity and/high-intence/1intens/high intensity434th intensity training/intens0intens/4intens/3andhigh intensity.90and0-0sIntensintens4intenshigh-training is itera6.Intens00sintens (Four method (107-high-5s4.9 intensive intensity/intense305-high intensity and intensintens high5intensintens0intense/high intensity training.30intensintensintensint/ highintens/4intens/the intensity of these methods/intens5high-intensitens?and5/high-intens and intensity/high intensity to intensive\n4anders and the 0010.7s training as intensive intensity/aer\n3.int/high?high intensity is training/int high/high\n5 4\ns\n2.7. highers with end Intensions.9 Int.
