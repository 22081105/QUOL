As the pace of change increases, it can be challenging to keep up. And though change is inevitable, the ability to adapt is not. Learning how to learn and learning how to teach, in many ways, are the same thing. You must learn to learn to teach. As a teacher, you are expected to be the master of your specific content area, whether it is Mathematics, Biology, Music, Literature, or History. Yet learning how to teach, especially in the 21st century, is more than a matter of specific content. It is a matter of shifting habits. It is about learning how to learn. \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nWhen you begin thinking about learning as learning how to learn, you begin to make connections between what you teach and how you learn. By connecting your knowledge about reading, writing, and arithmetic, you become a more effective teacher for your students. \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nBecoming a life-long learner means you\u2019re always searching for an edge\u2014something that will keep your skills strong and your job relevant. Every year, new jobs are created. In 2005, 250,000 new marketing jobs were created. But if the average length of time someone stays employed is only about four years, that means 500,000 people are looking for new jobs. That puts job-seekers at a serious disadvantage during the first stages of the job search. In order to stay relevant in this new economy, you must be learning all the time. In fact, the better question to ask is, What can you do to stay relevant? \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nIn a new Economic Era, you need to ask yourself, What skills do I need to be successful? It\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s necessary for doing your job ten years from now. What you do need to do is ask, What can I learn to help me do my job better? What can I learn to help me prepare for a new job if I don\u2019t love the job I currently have? \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nThe best defense against change is to be prepared for it. \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nAs a teacher in a rapidly changing Economic world, you will be faced with a plethora of new ideas, new trends, and new problems to solve. This may lead to stress and uncertainty. You have a choice: You can accept challenges or run away from them. Acceptance means you\u2019re not afraid to learn something new. There is a tendency, however, to take responsibility for learning outside of ourselves, and that is how we are trained. We tend to seek the security of the known and resist uncovering something new or accepting uncertainty and the unknown. When it comes to learning, you should always be excited about a new idea. \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c41\n\nThere are a variety of learning strategies that can be identified from this reading:\n\nAnswer Choice -

In other words, a typical classical piece has many notes, fast or slow-changing rhythms, and a variety of melodies, instrumentation, or harmonies. In contrast, jazz and rock music emphasize strong rhythms and melodies with a certain range of pitches and harmonies.\nClassical music is often performed alone or in groups. Because it is typically difficult to perform, the number of performers in a piece also differs (e.g., solo, duo, piano four hand, trio, quartet, or full orchestra). Rock and jazz music are usually performed by small groups (e.g., trio or quartet).\nPopular, or commercial music, is also different from classical music. Popular (also referred to as pop) music is usually very simple \u2014 it has only a few notes or chords \u2014 but it makes heavy use of repetition (a common practice in most popular music). In pop music, the instrumentation tends to be limited, and the songs typically lack sophisticated harmonies or rhythmic patterns. Popular music also tends to have a wide repertoire, making use of many different types of songs, styles, and instruments.\nIn these examples, the three different types of music are illustrated in very different ways. The classical piece begins with a simple melody that takes a while to progress (it gets more complex as it goes along). The next piece is very repetitive and minimalistic. Finally, the last piece is more complex with a greater number of notes, chords, and rhythms and a wide variety of instruments.", "num_tokens_generated": 410, "OGF": 0.10009765625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 9.154236316680908, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 232, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

In bluegrass the key tends to favor D major or A minor. This is no rule and some songs are played in D minor, but when the song is in D it is almost always in D major.\nWhat is the difference between Major and Minor scales?\nIn both Major & Minor Scale scales there are eight notes, the first, last and sixth notes (the major tones) of the scale as well as the second, third, fifth, and seventh notes (the minor tones). What makes the Major and Minor scales different is the placement of the third, sixth, seventh and eighth notes. In Major scale the third, sixth, seventh and eighth notes are raised a half step. In the Minor scale the third, sixth, seventh and eighth notes are flattened a half step. This is a simple way to explain what the difference is between scales, but it needs to be explained that the minor and major notes do carry with them different flavors and emotions. When you hear these notes you can almost instantly identify the scale that it is part of.\nGiven a series of seven musical notes, construct a scale based on the principle that every step in the key is equal to a half step.\nI have tried many ways to write a scale that will encompass every possible note and still make them equal by half notes. My math is not that great, so I could have done a better job, but I made some assumptions. Such as the octave is broken every six notes. This way a seven note scale only had seven different notes in the scale. I assume that, for example, C-E-G make up the second octave of the scale and D-F-A make up the third octave. However, if someone could tell me a better way to do it, I'm open to hearing it. Just remember that the key is the order of the notes to start with. After that the first octave of the notes is next, then the second and finally the third and fourth. The other scale in this post does the same thing in a different way, but as long as that is the way it was done, it has to be right.\nAs I stated in my previous post, the octave begins with D-E-F-G-A-B-C, then D-E-F-G-A-B-C and finally D-E-F-G-A-B-C.\nHow do I identify the key of a song based on its scale?\nWhen analyzing a scale pattern you will want to first determine what scale the composer used. This is done be listening to the bass or the first note. If the bass is \ufffd\u0596\ufffd \u05c1\u05b6 \u05b7 \u05b0\u05bc \u05b4\u05b6 \u05b4, which is C, then the scale is some type of minor key. If the bass is \u05b7 \u05c1\u05b4\u05b9\u05c1\u05b5 \u05b4\u05b6 \u05b4\u05b6 \u05b4\u05b6 \u05b6, which is G, then the scale is a Minor key. Next, determine which octave you will use for the scale. A lot of the time it is the first octave, which would start with C. If the scale started on D, the next octave would be \u05d3\u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b8\u05c1 \u05c1\u05b0 \u05b0 \u0aea\u05b0 \u05b0 \u05d5\u05bc \u05b0 \u05b0\u05b8\u05c1 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b2 \u05b7 \u05b7 \u05b7. If the scale started with E, then \u05c1\u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05c1\u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b7 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b7 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05d2\u05bc \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b0 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 \u05b5 , and so on.\nOnce you have figured out what scale you have, then find the key by adding up the notes in the scale.

of the document the scale will be analyzed from two different points of view. The first is an analysis of what notes make up the scale and the second is what order they were played in to create the overall pattern. When I teach students on how to learn songs, or at least my preference, is to put people on scales that sound good. In most cases people who play music know what major and minor scales sound like, but they don't know how to identify them by looking at a song. In blues, country, and folk music, most times the pattern that makes up the scale will have a different shape, but the notes that make up the pattern will stay the same. The first scale will be minor and the second scale will be the same scale but with a different pattern of notes.\nWhat makes the scale a major or minor one is how the pattern of notes was arranged starting from the root note.\nA 100% Major scale pattern has the same pattern of notes 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1 throughout the whole scale.\nA 0% Major scale pattern has the same pattern of notes 2,1,1,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 but with a different pattern of notes being played.\n1 = E,2= F,3= G,4= A,5= B,6= C,7= D,8= E,9= F,10=.\nNote: This pattern can also be analyzed as the same root note is played the same number of times.\n1=A,2=B,3=C,4=D,5=E,6=F,7=G,8=G,9=A,10=B,11=C,12=D,13=E,14=E,15=F,16=G.\nNote: This pattern can also be analyzed as each note the root note is played the same number of times.\nWhat makes the scale a minor one is how many times the pattern of notes is played.\nA Major scale pattern has the same pattern of notes 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1 to start the scale, then two more times. This makes the scale pattern 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1.\nIn the scale pattern of A Major as an example, the root note (E) is played 4 times, and every note gets played an additional time. Since every note but the 1st gets played another time, this makes the scale pattern 4,4,4,4.\nA Minor scale pattern has the same pattern of notes 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1 to start the scale, then two extra times. This makes the scale pattern 1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1. If you take the pattern of notes and subtract one, then you get the pattern of notes that makes up a Minor scale. This works as an easy way to identify what Major and Minor scales sound like.\nIn the scale pattern of A Minor as an example, the root note (E) is played 3 times, and every note gets played another time. Since every note but the 1st gets played another time, this makes the scale pattern 3,3,3,3.\nWhat makes the scale a Major or Minor scale is how many times the notes are played after the root note from the start of a scale.\nIn the scale pattern of A Major as an example, the root note example, the (E) is played 4 times, and every note gets played another time. Since every note but the 1st gets played another time, this makes the scale pattern the root note (E) is 4.

A free market (commonly called a market economy or capitalist market-economy) is an economic system whereby the production and distribution of goods and services are guided by supply and demand, and prices are determined in a free price system. In a free market, the laws and forces of supply and demand are self-regulating. 1. It allows for private ownership. 2. The incentive to acquire wealth or improve the quality of life is to benefit yourself. 3. There is minimal government intervention for the most part. 4. Competition is encouraged. 5. Consumers are the ultimate boss. 6. It has been and is considered the best system in terms of economic growth and human development. 7. It encourages innovation and technological growth. 8. It does not require a command system.

Suppose a government raised the income tax rate during a recession. Explain how and why this would cause further declines in real national income. 5. Explain how a government can fight a recession by using expansionary fiscal policy. Discuss the reasons for the limitations and costs of such actions. 6. Explain how an economy will respond to a shift rightwards along the classical production function. Discuss reasons for businesses to change the nature of their production as shown in an IS-LM model. (This question comes from lecture 22) 7. Explain the idea that when interest rates fall, the demand for money will increase. How does this help to explain how a reduction in the interest rate results in expansions in national income and employment? (Hints: i) This could happen if households borrowed money.) ii) Alternatively, banks lowering rates would lead savers (who mostly are institutions) to demand more money. iii) Banks would then issue loans and there would be more loanable funds (this is what bank loans are), leading to an increase in the demand for loans. 2) Suppose the AS and AD curves shift to the left. How would this affect the price level, real incomes and the rate of interest? Explain each of these things. (Hints: i) Price level and interest rate would increase (decrease). ii) Real incomes would fall (rise). iii) Aggregate demand would fall (rise). 3) Suppose the AS curve shifts to the left, so that real incomes rise, inflation rises and the rate of interest falls. How does this affect the position of the AS curve (relative to the earlier position)? Explain why it moves. Illustrate your response graphically. (Hints: The AS curve would shift up wards if inflation and interest rates fell. This would mean that, in a free enterprise economy, interest rates would fall and then rise which would affect the AD and AS curves as they change because the AD curve would increase but then the AS curve would increase.) 4) An unemployed Canadian worker loses a government job in a community devastated by a recent forest fire. As a result, she is forced to go east to Halifax in search for work, and she loses $5 for every $10 she earns by taking a lower paying job in this eastern city. Explain how the loss of the government job affects the worker s demand for money and real pay, and explain how the loss of jobs to Halifax affects the monetary and real economic bases of income in the eastern city.

Illustrate your explanation using either a Keynesian equilibrium level model or a Neoclassical real business cycle model. Consider the implications, not only for national income, but also for inflation.

Describe some ways in which a government might choose to control the supply of money and the real interest rate. 4. Describe the relationship between government output and taxes, and the relationship between government output and debt. Explain the effect on the economy of: i) a reduction in government spending, ii) an increase in government spending, iii) a reduction in taxes, and iv) an increase in taxes. 5. If there is inflation in Canada, explain how this makes real GDP higher, and why this happens. Explain if this will improve or make worse the unemployment rate in Canada. 6. If a recession occurs in Canada, which of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are likely to be more effective in alleviating the effects of the recession? Explain your reasoning. (Hints: 27th Edition MacEvoy & Cashin Money & Banking Lecture Notes) 1) Explain how taxes and government spending affect national income. (Hint: This question relates to 1-4 in Lecture ) 2) Discuss some arguments to support a balanced-budget theory of fiscal policy. Discuss an alternative view of fiscal policy. Which do you think would be better for the economy in the long run?

How many people will pay higher incomes after the cut in taxes? b) What would happen if the government changed its own spending by $60 per person? How many people would be affected by this change? c) How would the real GDP be increased by $100,000,000 per year, and how many people would benefit? 4) Suppose a local government increases spending by $25 per person. a) What is the initial impact on the economy in the short run? How many people will pay higher incomes after the cut in taxes? b) What would happen if the local government changed its tax rate in the same fashion? How many people would be affected? c) How would the real GDP of the local economy be increased by $100,000,000 per year, and how many people would benefit? 5) Show how the multipliers would change if: a) The government s spending is increased b) The government s taxes are decreased c) Tax collections are increased. (Hints: 27th Edition MacEvoy & Cashin Money & Banking Lecture Notes) 6) Explain how a decrease in government spending affects the economy. Give an example of the type of program affected by such a cut, and explain what would happen to real national income in response to this change. (Hint: Explain why the long run level of real national income in this case will remain constant. 28th Edition MacEvoy & Cashin Money & Banking Lecture Notes) 1) Show how unemployment, inflation, and monetary policy affect the money supply and the real interest rate. (Hint: For each of the following scenarios, explain which of the fiscal or monetary policies would be better for the economy: a) Both inflation and unemployment will fall, even if the real interest rate stays the same. b) Either both inflation and unemployment will fall and the real interest rate will remain the same, or both inflation and unemployment will stay the same but the real interest rate will decrease.. 29th Edition MacEvoy & Cashin Money & Banking Lecture Notes\n4 Chapter 28 Macroeconomics, Exchange Rates, and Open Economy Issues 2. Explain the fundamental reasons why the exchange rates of different countries in a world economy fluctuate. Why do we use a nominal variable (relative prices) rather than a real (absolute price) in understanding how exchange rates work? (Hint: Firstly, determine the basic definitions and definitions related to determining the exchange rate system. 2. Explain both the supply and demand model as they relate to the determination of exchange rates, and compare and contrast the two approaches. For the purpose of comparison, explain the short-run movements in currencies using the supply and demand model.) 3. Determine how monetary policy affects the value of a foreign currency in a country. Explain the effects of a change in exchange rates in the following economic situations: (a) a fall in the value of the domestic currency, and (b) a rise in the value of the foreign currency in the domestic country, respectively. (Hint: Firstly, determine the basic definitions used to explain these economic situations in an open economy situation.) 4. Explain how the current account (balance of trade) effects the relative price level for goods with respect to services and capital (e.g. goods, interest rates, and exchange rate). (Hint: Firstly, explain the main components of the balance of payments as they relate to the current account. Further, explain the effects of the current account on either goods or services and investments in a country.) 2. Explain how a government might attempt to change exchange rates with trading partners in a free enterprise economy. Discuss some of the potential economic costs and benefits (e.g. on real national income or unemployment). (Hint: Determine the basic definitions related to determining the exchange rate system.) 4. Explain why a fall in a country s real exchange rate is associated with an increase in that country s net capital outflow. How this is explained in terms of the effects that the change in exchange rates and economic activity in the country of the exporter? (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the basic definitions of the real exchange rate and current account balances of trade.) (i) Calculate a measure of the real exchange rate for the UK and Canada over the sample period. Which country has lower real exchange rate, and what determines this difference? 5. Given a change in the government budget balance in a country as expressed relative to the value of the domestic currency, explain which effect will prevail in terms of the country s exchange rate. (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the main components of the government budget balance and determine the change in each component relative to the domestic currency valuation.) (i) A change in exchange rates causes domestic GDP to increase by 2%. Calculate the effect on unemployment of a change in exchange rates. Does this change in the price level, nominal wages and the expected price level? Include all details in your answer. 28th Edition MacEvoy & Cashin Money & Banking Lecture Notes\n5 Chapter 29 Macroeconomics, Export Prices, and Open Economy Issues (cont.) 2. Explain and illustrate graphically how the world market price of exported goods can impact on the price level and the interest rate in an economy. (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the main components of the government budget balance and determine the change in each component relative to the domestic currency valuation.) (ii) Explain how exchange rate movements in the short term can impact both the real price and quantity of exported goods supplied. Illustrate graphically how this impact would occur, and explain the difference between changes in the real and nominal/domestic value of an exported good. (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the main components of the government budget balance and determine the change in each component relative to the domestic currency valuation.) 2. Explain how an export tax on Canadian goods can have both intended and unintended effects. (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the main components of the government budget balance and determine the change in each component relative to the domestic currency valuation. Secondly, explain the intended and unintended impact on Canada s terms of trade by the imposition of an export tax on Canadian exports. Further, discuss the related impact on real national income as it relates to the change in Canada s terms of trade, and explain how exchange rate movements in the short term can impact both the real price and quantity of exported goods.) 4. Discuss your view of the following statement: A fall in the value of Canada s dollar relative to that of the U.S. dollar improves Canada s net capital outflow. Explain the reasons for your position, and identify the assumptions that you would be making. (Hint: Firstly, distinguish the main components of the government budget balance and determine the change in each component relative to the domestic currency valuation. Further, explain the impact that a fall in the real value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will have on net capital outflows, and the effect that will have on the current account balance in that country in terms of changes in Canada s net capital outflow. Finally, discuss the related impact on real national income as it relates to the change in Canada s terms of trade, and explain how exchange rate movements in the short term can impact both the real price and quantity of exported goods.)\nSANIHAM HASHIM.

The formula for velocity is the direction of the constant.\nIs velocity a vector or a scalar?\nIt is a vector.\nAnswer = $\\rm{\\bar{R}\\:s^{-1}\\:W^{-1}\\:s^{\\rm{-1}}$ in cgs system.\nBut the SI unit 'metre/second' is used for velocity in SI system.$\\rm{V\\:s^{-1}}$\nThe unit 'metre/second/second' for speed is not used and is not valid as it is not in compliance with the principle of composition.\n$\\rm{v\\:m\\:s^{-1}\\Rightarrow\\rm{v=v\\:m/s}$}\nThe units of the SI are the SI unit symbols.\nExample - SI units for an object traveling at 2 km/h have an uncertainty of \u00b12%.\n$\\rm{\\bar{R}\\:s^{-1}\\:W^{-1}\\:s^{\\rm{-1}}$=0.01889[km/h], which is an acceptable $\\rm{\\bar{R}\\:s^{-1}\\:W^{-1}\\:s^{\\rm{-1}}}$ to obtain the velocity as 0.14[km/h].\nExample - A constant force with magnitude $F\\:N$ is applied on an object of mass $m\\:kg$ with velocity $v\\:m/s$. The acceleration is $g\\:m/s^{2}$.\nNow find the momentum of the object? (Assume that $m$ has units of time, which are also equivalent to mass; and $g$ has units of length, hence they are also equivalent to mass in the $\\rm{[kg]}$ unit system.)\n$\\rm{(m\\,g)\\,v^{\\rm{-2}}}$ = 1 [kg/(m/s$^{\\rm{-2}}$)].\nWhat do you mean by a scalar and a vector?\n$\\rm{\\bar{R}\\:s^{-1}\\:W^{-1}\\:s^{\\rm{-1}}$ can be thought as a measure of the force of gravity, while the velocity $\\rm{v\\:m/s}$ is relative, because it measures speed; and in the same direction.\nIs velocity a vector or a scalar? Is velocity a vector or a scalar? $\\endgroup$ add a comment | 0.\nThe general form for the relationship between the two is:\nwhere $v$ is the velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, $t$ is time and $g$ is gravitational acceleration. The SI Unit for time is seconds, and for acceleration, newtons per second per second and for gravity, this is not currently defined.\nFor Example, at what speed is a body falling in the gravitational force of earth?\n$\\bar{\\lambda} = \\bar{\\Omega}_{1}/ \\lambda$ as we know is the magnitude of angular frequency of any body. Hence, for example, Earth makes one rotation every 24 hours.\nAs this answer tells us that $\\lambda$ is the Angular Frequency, we have this:\n$\\bar{\\Omega}_{1}$ = $\\bar{\\Omega}_{2}/\\lambda$\n$\\bar{\\lambda} = \\bar{\\Omega}_{2} / \\lambda$\nThus, $$\\lambda = $$\nHere $\\bar{\\Omega}_2 = 7.292138$\\ rad/s\\ and $\\bar{\\lambda} = 2.332693\\ rad/s\\ $.\nThus, $$g =$$ As seen, $g$ is 100 times faster than Earth's angular velocity. This is due to the fact that Earth's radius is 7000 km and $\\lambda$ is $\\frac{2\u03c0\\rm r}{T\\rm r}$\nIn the gravitational force, the strength of the gravitational force on any planet depends on the mass of that planet.\n$g$ is greater than that on the Moon, Venus, Mars or Jupiter.\nHow did Einstein\u2019s general relativity correct the error made by Newton and Galileo?", "num_tokens_generated": 1524, "OGF": 0.3720703125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 35.17561388015747, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 245, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

What is the force required to stop a 12 kg object in 24 s at a rate of 1.5 m/s^2? Physics, 21.06.2019 02:00 kelcyn7334. It is the ratio of the normal force pushing down on the cart to the total force pushing down on the cart (and the weight of the mass of the cart, which acts down). We can use newtons to calculate the force required to accelerate a car for a collision as long as we know the weight of \u2026 If an object has weight of 22 N and the scale reads 196 N, What is the object's acceleration? Answer. Different masses accelerate at different rates. The car's weight (Fweight) is equal to its mass (m) times its acceleration (a), F weight = m a. An object's weight does not change based on its speed. You need to enter the values of mass of object, its acceleration and time interval. 3612 Words. Physics Problem 1. Determine the force required to accelerate the bus at 7.00 m/s^2 over a distance of 11.0 m in a stop that takes 7.00s. Example: A 96000 kg car accelerates at 3M/S per second. Explanation: There are several problems with the concept of calculating the force an object needs to accelerate an object in a vacuum at a rate of 0 m/s 2 , such as: The acceleration of gravity is not an accurate value at a zero value for force. What is the magnitude of its net weight? The car's velocity will not change based on its speed since its speed is less than 1 m/s. 2.3 Acceleration of an object is calculated by applying force over a large distance as defined by a coefficient of drag. A = W/g . What is the acceleration of the body with a mass of 5 kg (assume g=10 m/s 2) when you exert a force F = 56 N on the body? This means that with the same application of force and mass, a lighter object will accelerate faster than a heavier object. Determine the mass of the object weighing 88 N and the acceleration of the object weighing 498 N. If an object has a mass (M1) of a kilogram and a velocity (v1) of a m/s and is moving in a vacuum, the acceleration (a1) will be, F = M xA = M1 x 9.8 Newtons per Meter per Second = 9.8 N; When you accelerate a body using force. A=W/g a=W g =mg Weight = m x gravity m = 100 kg 100 x 9.8 \u2026 Acceleration, or a(t), can be calculated as, Here, the value of a must be defined based on the situation at hand. Let us consider a body of mass m attached to massless rope which is in a horizontal position. m = 50 kg \u2248 11 stone. The equation is given as F= ma. For instance, consider an object with a mass of 100 kg and a velocity of 4.0 m/s. The acceleration of the object is -2.5 /66000 = 0.000381 /sec square. For example, I am standing on a scale reading 53 N. If I drop a bowling ball that weighs 15 lb., the scale will read 68. What do you think of this site? You know that the object acceleration is 8.9 m/s/s. A = Force/mass. It is commonly denoted with an italic small letter a, and read as the letter \"A.\". The net force on this object is called the resultant force and its magnitude can be determined by, F=MA; the acceleration can be found by the equation, F=ma; the mass can be found by combining the two, A = W/g; finally, the weight can be found using, F = W + A or F = mg, where W is for weight and A is for acceleration. Expert Answer 100% \u2026 If that object is in motion and you applied a larger force to accelerate it the acceleration will increase. The car has a mass of about 2000 kg, so the weight will be 2000 x 9.8 m/s^2 = 19600 N. I hope this helps, let me know if \u2026 Acceleration of object is dependent upon the rate of change in velocity over time. What is its net weight? (Source: http://www.bentleypublishing.com/bentley/content/images/b/b/Bentley-bentley-scientific-notebook-3-7758s_1-1.jpg) For acceleration to occur, two forces must be applied on an object. The mass (m) and force (F) required to accelerate the box to speed 10 m/s are, F = 0.10 kg x 0.36 m/s, = 0.036 kg. In other words: This is the acceleration that the object would have on a planet where the acceleration due to gravity is 0. For instance, consider an object with a mass of 100kg and a velocity of 4m/s. When a body is accelerated by an external force, both the mass and the velocity of the body changes. Acceleration Formula. When you use more, or less, force and/or apply that force in a manner that causes it to cause greater or lesser acceleration then the results will be the same. What is its net weight? The acceleration of an object is always measured relative to the frame of reference of the observer. Example problem:A 10kg ball traveling at 5 m / s is accelerated to 13 m /s in time t. Determine a and F. Solution: a = (13 - 5)/t F =ma. What mass of the object is required in order to accelerate the trolley at 3 m/s/s. It is equal to F/m, where m is the (signed) mass of the particle referred to and F is the magnitude of the force. A mass of 1 kg experiences a force of 20 N if it is accelerated at a rate of 20 m/s 2. In other words, Force/Mass is equal to Acceleration in this formulae: Example: Two vehicles of same shape and of different masses, one of 1 tonne and the other of 1 tonne and half. An object's acceleration depends on its mass, so the greater the mass of the object the greater its acceleration. Force = mass x acceleration. Acceleration Formula. It requires the same amount of force/mass for a heavier object to accelerate as a lighter object. Object accelerates when work done on it increases its kinetic energy. A = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 (the universal acceleration of gravity). F = m * a. I like to look up that force equation in the SI base units and plug in m, W, and t. That is why I like to call it the acceleration equation instead of the force equation. In terms of Physics, the word \u201cacceleration\u201d refers to the rate of change of the object\u2019s motion with time. Calculating Weight from Newton's Law. Force = ma The relationship of an object's mass and acceleration. What mass, speed and friction coefficient will get the same object to an average speed of 100 m/s? Calculate A for the car. If the car travels at 8 m/s and hits a second car which is stopped, what will be the distance which the car will travel backwards? Determining whether something like an animal, a car or even a truck is heavy or not. Expert Answer 100% (2 ratings) The acceleration of the box is 1.2 m/s2. What is the acceleration of the body weighing 498 N? When you accelerate a body using force. Acceleration is how fast an object\u2019s velocity changes with time. Find out the net weight of the body that has accelerated to an inertial acceleration of 107 m/s if it weighs 39.8 kg. Mass M = 1 gram. I hope this helps, let me know if there is anything else I can help with. A=F (A force is needed to accelerate an object in a straight line toward a certain target.) A car accelerates at 100 km/h\u00b2 for 10 minutes and then returns to its starting position with a speed of 80 km/h. A1 = (0m / s) / 0s = 0 m / s2. Determine the mass of the object that would accelerate the cart at a rate of 16.4 m/s 2. Acceleration is when an object is applied to an external force that causes the object to change its speed. What is the acceleration of the cart? The weight of the 3 kg ball is 3 x 9.8 x 3 x 48 = 328.4 N. 4. A mass of 1 kg experiences a force of 20 N if it is accelerated at a rate of 20 m/s2. 2. Acceleration is how fast an object increases its \u2026 If we have a block of mass 50 kg which is resting or moving with velocity v0, and then we apply the force with some time difference and then finally it reaches the velocity v with acceleration a, the net force on this mass is = m x \u222b 0 t (F \u2013 ma) dt.

The Revisionist History of Islam\n5. Excerpt From: Robert Spencer. \u201cStealth Jihad: How Radical Islam is Exploiting the West\u2019s Freedoms.\u201d iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/stealth-jihad/id785077886?mt=11\n6. The Revisionist History of Islam By Shaykh (Dr.) Yasir Qadhi 1 1 The Revisionist History of Islam by Dr. Shaykh Yasir al-Qadhi [The translation of the meaning is by Yasin T. al-Jabbar. It has been approved by Dr. Yasir al-Qadhi.] The translation of Allaah is the Most High, and the translation of the Messenger sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam is his noble saying. All praise is for Allaah and none is deserving of worship except Him. I testify that no god is worthy of worship except Him, the Truly Ever-Living, without a partner, maker of all that is, and He alone should be worshipped. All praise and thanks be to Allaah for His having guided me to the straight path. Indeed He is a witness over me, herein and elsewhere. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our master Muhammad, the possessor of all virtues and merits. May Allaah have mercy on those who love him, and send blessings on those who are of his companions. This small book was written by me, when my attention was drawn to the erroneous ways which have come into existence in our times, which are neither in accordance with the Qur\u2019aan or the Sunnah, nor with the consensus of the Companions. However, I have not set out to discuss all those corruptions, since they have multiplied manifold over the centuries, until they reach the status of being an industry unto itself. My attention was specifically drawn to the ways of the Hafidh al-Husayn, who is famous for his saying that \u2018Islam is but a religion of joy\u2019. My brothers in Madinah have told me many of his statements, which clearly indicate that he is an innovator and a deviationist. His saying is far from the truth, an error which the majority of the innovators have stated. I shall mention here a few of the quotes from him to demonstrate his erroneous view, and also those which are upon the guidance from the Book and the Sunnah. He said: \u2018In any case, the manners of the Prophet, may Allaah bestow peace and blessings upon him, were of a nature which made the companions of the Prophet happy and joyful\u2019. (Manaawi, Fadhaail al-Samaa\u2019) He further said: \u2018The companions of the Prophet, may Allaah bestow peace and blessings upon him, were people who were full of joyfulness and smiles. Therefore Allaah says: \u201cAnd indeed you came to Us as My worshippers\u201d [al-Furqan: 29].\u2019 (Kitaab at-Tawheed) He further said: \u2018From the bounties of Allaah and His mercy on us Muslims is that we have been singled out for laughter and joy among the Ummah of the Messengers. \u2026 Indeed the Prophet, may Allaah bestow His peace and His favour upon him, knew and was aware of what was in Allaah\u2019s heart.\u2019 (Kitaab at-Tawheed) He also said: \u2018The Companions of the Prophet, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, laughed a lot. The Prophet too laughed a lot.\u2019 (al-Fadhaail) He further said: \u2018I have not seen any period like the one we are in now, when everyone loves laughter and smiling. As for the Companions of the Prophet \u2026 this did not occur in their time.\u2019 (al-Furqan: 7-8, Kitaab Al-\u2018Idah) In these and similar statements, al-Husayn has claimed that Islam is a religion of joy and laughter. Therefore, if there was joy in Islam, he implies, it is now completely absent, as is laughter, with the exception of the time of the Prophet and his Companions in Madinah. The question which needs to be answered is that what is the truth in this matter, and what is the manner of Islam? The answer is simple: The Messenger of Allaah was sent as a guide unto mankind till the end of days. He came to convey a message, namely, that of guidance in beliefs, morals, and lifestyle. It is not the case that the Prophet came to the Muslims in order to teach them a worldly system that is good for morale and happiness. Islam was not sent as a tool to provide morale and happiness in society as if it is a philosophy. Islam is not a worldly philosophy, but a guide towards Allaah, the Creator and Lord of Mankind. It is not for this reason that the Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favor upon him, was brought. His only being is that which Allaah sent as a Messenger from amongst the messengers. He, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, is a servant of Allaah Who was commanded by His Lord, just as all other Messengers were commanded. The prophets, may Allaah\u2019s mercy be upon them all, were simply called to guide to the straight path, and to inform mankind of the nature and actions which Allaah has commanded and forbidden. In order to achieve this objective, the Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, was given immense support by Allaah, in that He gave him of His wisdom, intellect, and spiritual knowledge; He gave Him knowledge of all kinds, and granted him all of His blessings. His successors from amongst the rightly guided khulafaa were also granted of Allaah\u2019s favours in the same sense, in which they were not only leaders, but were also the repositories of knowledge of the Qur\u2019an. In their successors from the T\u0101bi\u2019\u016bn, those who followed in their footsteps, there were the likes of Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Ibn Sirin and others whose knowledge equalled and surpassed all of their contemporaries; and were the repositories of knowledge. They were able to teach both the people and other Prophets and Messengers which was uncommon in the sense that not every Prophet or Messenger was accorded the fortune to convey what they did convey, nor did every nation have such a distinguished teacher to guide it to the straight path. In light of all of this, what is it that makes the likes of al-Husayn err in their statements? Allah says: \u201cAnd indeed you came to us as My worshippers\u201d (48:29), showing that Allah\u2019s mercy is attained through worship. However, the fact that He says (in the above) that the Prophet\u2019s Companions were full of joy and smiles, and that it did not occur in their time, indicates that there is a distinction between the time of the Companions and the time of the later generations \u2013 that which separated them is the time which is the reason for their happiness and the cause of their joy. Similarly, the Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, said: \u2018There has never been a people which has been the objects of the curse of Allaah and His punishment like the people of `Iram ad-Dammah, so it was brought near to the earth, until it was covered with dust, and no trace of it remained - except that there remains a mountain amongst the mountains of Shaam, the highest point of which is better than the furthest mountain in Yemen. The inhabitants of that mountain were not more than twenty, and were eating and drinking, unaware of the time, until a cloud came pouring forth and it rained on them. The people saw them eating and drinking, and were amazed.\u2019 (Muslim, and other references) Indeed, this is the truth concerning the matter. The Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, was commanded to guide until the end of days, and to convey the Messengership until the Hour befalls, and thus he would be an intercessor on the Day of Judgment. Apart from that, Allah granted him knowledge unknown to the rest of creation. This was something which occurred amongst the Companions only, and none were equal to them in this regard. They were the best of generations; however, they themselves recognized that they were not worthy, and that Allah had chosen over them His Messengers and servants. Allah says: \u2018Say: If the whole of mankind and the jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur\u2019aan, they could not produce its like, even if they were to each other a thousand times\u201d (al-Isra: 18). The Messenger is one of the greatest, yet he says: \u2018If I were to be honoured to be in the likeness of a prophet, then I would say the same as you. However, if I am honoured to be like a Prophet amongst Prophets, then I shall certainly claim what you have claimed, but there is something in this matter, which Allah has favoured me with \u2013 something which no one amongst you can have. And verily the fact is that I see the angel guarding me, and he is no ordinary angel, rather he is one of two great angels, Jibr\u00eel and Mikaa\u2019il. It is he who came to me in a dream and revealed the Qur\u2019aan.\u2019 (Bukhari, al-Adab) The angelic visions and the knowledge of dreams are from the mercy of Allah, and are not granted to everyone. The Companions never said, \u2018Indeed Allah has made us the happiest of generations, and the joyous and laughing generation\u2019. Rather, they were always humble and aware of what they were to Allah, and knew themselves to be amongst those who are the worst of creatures. They did not find joy in the worldly sense; rather they were happy when they found themselves in the company of Allah, and when they were able to gain knowledge of Him, or to attain nearness to Him. In fact, many of the pious predecessors used to weep for fear that Allah should deprive humanity of knowledge, or that Jinn might be able to overpower the humanity, or that humanity might overpower the Jinn, since in all of this there is fitnah \u2013 a test from Allah. As for the claim of al-Husayn that \u2018Islam is but a religion of joy\u2019, it is incorrect and is not in accordance with the saying of the Companions. They never used to say such a thing and never did they proclaim their own selves to be the happiest. Indeed, the Companions were not happy, neither before Islam, nor afterward. Their happiness was not the type of happiness which you may find in the world, but rather it was a happiness which was attained as their relationship with Allaah became more and more close. In short, the relationship of the Companions with Allaah and His Messenger was so close that they were in communication with Allah, and they were speaking with Him, and they were in a continuous state of communication with Allah, and in a state of submission at all times. They were in a state of devotion and fear, such that the Companions of the Prophet, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, were sometimes not able to speak throughout the entire day, and would remain silent, devout, and in state of constant humility. In these conditions they feared and loved Allah, and they feared that Allah would punish them. In short, they were always in the state of tawbah and seeking repentance and forgiveness in the hope that Allah would forgive them of all their sins. They were not like those today whom you find with no fear or shame in front of Allah. In truth, the Companions feared the Mercy of Allah, fearing that Allah would humiliate and degraded them as a consequence of their sinfulness. They feared that He would not forgive them, but rather would punish them forever in the fire, as did Musa, may Allaah exalt his mention, and his brother Haroon (peace be upon them). Indeed, if a person had never seen the angels, and even though he had not feared Allah, yet he saw the angels, he would realise, with certainty, that Allah is the One who possesses dominion over all things. He will be full of fear and humility. Allah says: \u2018Verily, He has a place wherein the angels cannot penetrate. If Allah desired He would punish you for your wrongdoings. Or He would forgive you. Indeed Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful\u2019 [al-Zumar: 14] Such is the state of those who believe in Allah. Such is the state of the pious predecessors, those who followed them, and those who follow them. This is the reality underlying the question of \u2018do the Companions smile?\u2019 or is \u2018Islam a religion of laughter\u2019? It is clear that there is a great deal of difference between the laughing of the Companions and their smiles and their laughter, and the laughter of those who say: \u2018Islam is a religion of joy\u2019. Indeed, this notion is unreliable, and is not from the truth. Allah says: \u201cSuch is the Paradise that the Merciful promised His righteous servants, when they say: \u201cOur Lord! In Thy Presence is indeed a place of safety, and to Thee do we turn, and to Thee do we return. Not fear, but hope. Nor was it but that I should be weak in pursuit of it; but if Allah please He is my Lord, unto which I have turned in repentance. My Lord! For Thou art He alone to Whom I have turned\u201d \u2013 and didst thou (the Prophet) not see that of all the creatures that God had created, and thou wert unaware of the unseen (world)?\u201d (38:59-65). In short, smiling and joyousness and laughter, are all from the bounties which Allah has bestowed upon the righteous slaves. In the words of the Messenger of Allah, may Allaah bestow His peace and His favour upon him: \u2018When the believer smiles, this signifies that he will enter Paradise and is pleased to be a Muslim. A time will come when the believer will pass by other believers and will tell him a good thing which he heard from the Messenger of Allah, and when he hears it, he will smile. When the unbeliever will pass by, he will tell him a lie about the believer that will cause him to laugh. So, if the believer heard that he was a disbeliever, he would be upset, and if he knew he was a hypocrite, he would hate him, but if he knew him to be a believer, he would want him more than anything.\u2019 (Bukhari) What is clear is that this laughter and smiling is an indication in the heart of the believer, which indicates to the rest of people that he is delighted and believes in that which Allah is pleased with, such as the religion of Islam which Allah has favoured him with. In this sense, laughter denotes pleasure, and smiling denotes happiness. However, for the evil people, it is the opposite to pleasure and happiness, since they laugh at and mock things which they believe to be evil. So their laughter is in the absence of faith, in the absence of Allah, and in their disbelief in His Messengers. This is the meaning of the Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, when he said: \u2018The believer smiles when he sees a believer do something to increase in faith, and he laughs at the hypocrite who laughs so as to expose the hypocrisy of the unbeliever.\u2019 It is known that smiling and laughter are one of the signs of happiness and pleasure. The Prophet is quoted as having said: \u2018The true believer who is a witness to something good, will smile even though you look at his teeth.\u2019 (Hasan) This is the true meaning of happiness and pleasure. The laughter of the Jews was with hypocrisy, and as a result, the Messenger, may Allaah bestow His peace and favour upon him, said: \u2018Woe to Haya\u2019, and so on. The smiling of the hypocrites in the era of Prophethood was a result of evil, and a consequence of their desire for the riches of the world. It was in connection with these people that Allah said: \u2018Some of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) wish they could turn you to disbelievers after you have believed, through dejection or through hatred among themselves. In that case, would you seek to harm them? And if you could, they would have devised some sort of evil scheme and would have been defeated. And if they do fight against you, they would only fight to turn you away from your religion. But Allah is your Guardian (Walaayat), and Allah is best at guarding. And they say: \u201cAllah took a son.\u201d Indeed, you have made an outlandish assertion. The heavens are but a canopy [like the roof] of two gardens. With your (Mighty) Glory you did fill them (the heavens/universe) with hulled smoke. And there emerged a luminous star [the Sun]. The stars are its missiles. As for Allah, has made it; only one (Sun) is an admonisher. It is not to Allah; neither an intercessor; nor an intercessor for mankind; nor any intercessor for Jew (people). It is not anything is in Allah; nor an intercessor; nor an intercessor is one. Is nor an intercessor is not intercessor is not an intercessor.

They proposed a two-layer network with input layer containing an encoder. The encoder processes the words in a sentence into one vector, which is then passed to the learner, a two-layer recurrent network. The network first creates a pair of representations of the sentence at each time step based on the hidden state. It then passes them to the softmax layer to predict the next element in the sentence.\n6 4.4.1 Self-attention Self-attention was originally proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014) for machine translation. Later, it was used in attention-based transformers such as VEGAS (Schuster and Chuang, 2018), Transformer-XL (Yang et al., 2019), and BPEG (He et al., 2019) for natural language processing. The paper by Bahdanau et al. (2014) describes self-attention as follows: Inputs to the self-attention mechanism are given one-hot vectors representing the positions in the input sequence, and outputs are weighted vectors representing the importance of each position to the final prediction of that position. In order to compute attentions, we use attention probabilities \u03b1 k \u22c5 V k to compute a linear transformation of the query: (2) where the dot product above is computed with the query and weight matrices, and (\u03b1 k ) is a softmax function applied to attention probabilities for that query. 4.4.2 Cascaded selectors Self-attention was proposed as a mechanism to capture attention within the input sequence. In order to capture the attention among different sequences, self-attention can be cascaded by stacking several self-attention layers on each other. 4.4.3 Selective self-attention As shown in Figure 5, selective self-attention (SSA) was also proposed to select important sentences by applying a linear layer (L s ) to the self-attention layer outputs in a sentence embedding. The linear layer is further enhanced by adding an additional position-attentive layer which predicts the input position using the sentence representation learned from the self-attention layer. For a given sequence s = (s1 , s2 , s3 ,... , sT ), we first apply a linear layer to the self-attention outputs of each word in s to obtain the sentence embedding s. We can then obtain the input position p = {pi : pi \u2208 {1, 2, 3 ,..., \u03b7}} of s from the sentence embedding using the position-attention model \u03c0. Given the self-attention model \u03a6 and the position-attention model \u03c0, the SSA module can be written as follows where \u03c8 s : S \u2295 (1, 2, 3 ,..., \u03b7) \u2192 V S is the function that selects all important positions in a sentence that are represented by an input vector and V S is the size of the input vector. The parameters of the position-attention model \u03c0 can be learned during training. Moreover, the linear layer \u03a5 can be also learned together with the softmax model through the cross-entropy loss.\n7 5.

Also, there is a lot of context, could you simplify the example down as necessary to only show the important detail?\n\nComment: Well first of all I'm not sure how to define a sentence/ paragraph, as in: paragraph 1. and this is the opening paragraph. or something like that\n\nComment: You should start by reading a good introduction to writing academic English, such as \"Style: A Student's Guide To Finding the Right Word at the Right Time\" by Micheal Swan (http://amzn.to/t9VwQH). There are many others, just check them out on Amazon.\n\nComment: Thanks. So what exactly do you think it should look like?\n\nComment: @DavidCarlisle I found the example so hard to follow even by reading the code so I added the actual code as per the question\n\nComment: I can't really follow it at moment but will look closer.\n\nComment: Okay just so that I understand how you want the output to look like, as in, I am providing you the answer but I do not quite know what \"good\" output looks like. I just do not want to be wasting your time by coming up with an answer that you find incorrect\n\nComment: You can also read about [Writing for the web](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/the-case-for-web-readable-markdown/)\n\nComment: It's ok, I've updated the question again. But please note that there's no good way of marking up paragraphs; all you can do is indent code and use sectioning commands like `\\section` and `\\subsection`.\n\nComment: This is not a realistic example of actual text. It is impossible to understand what is wrong. It's too long and convoluted ... it would be better to have a small, isolated thing you just want to show.\n\nAnswer: Here is a bit of a generic answer for any kind of text. I'm not sure this is particularly good for the specific example but I believe it would be a good improvement for that also.\n\nIn your example code, you are using `\\section` at the line starting with greenhouse effect. Try indenting that instead. Also the text following the `\\subsection` should not be a separate paragraph, but continue the text.\n\nYou seem to write some paragraphs which have a start and an end, possibly for different sections. However, the paragraphs in \\em{this} section of the text are not meant to be separate sections. That is the reason why `\\section` and `\\subsection`  are only used after `subsection` and not in the middle of \\em{that} section.\n\nTo help improve this section, it would be good to know what the text is about. I think the greenhouse effect is mentioned too many times for this to stand? That is, it might be too obvious that the `subsection` is about greenhouse effect.\n\nSo instead, maybe you could introduce your reader to a topic: global warming, for example, (don't forget to introduce it!). Then, in the `\\subsection`, you could explain why greenhouse effect, instead? Maybe have another `\\subsection` for something else about why greenhouse effect instead?\n\nThis is a kind of \\em{topic-based} structure. It is good to know what the topic is and what it should entail. For example if I write \"focusing on the greenhouse effect\" I don't really tell you what else the section consists of, but if it's \"greenhouse effect: explanation, causes, etc\" that would be better.\n\nIn addition, you have a lot of bullet points in this section, which don't seem to be related to anything. I don't know whether it is relevant to your text to have a bullet-point explanation about the difference between qualitative and quantitative lectures. There's a lot of unnecessary context and not very much concrete information here and there with the use of the `\\item`: that is to say that, for example, all the links could be incorporated into the text without `\\item`s.\n\nI hope that makes sense. Otherwise tell me and I'll fix it :D\n\nComment: I am learning this by myself and this is the text I was given. I just wanted to make it look better, as my supervisor said. But honestly I can't quite follow this answer. Can you give an example of what you mean by a topic-based structure?\n\nComment: Also are there websites for learning writing for academic English. I would prefer them over a book. The book is really expensive!\n\nComment: By topic I mean \"this section is about greenhouse effect\". That way you can write a section about it without having to actually mention greenhouse effect a lot. It is the topic of the section. \"For example\" would then be \"global warming\" if it's a section on that. It could also be \"what is a lecture\" or whatever. The point is that the \"section\" then has a topic, so it can be about only that without referencing it often for something else.\n\nComment: There are tons of good English websites. Look around.
