In the above program, we are using the String class methods \u2018length\u2019, \u2018indexOf\u2019, and \u2018toUpperCase\u2019 to solve the given problem. First, find the length of each string. The length of the longest common substring is the length of the leftmost maximal matching. The strings are separated by a whitespace. For the longest string subsequence problem, let be string A and B, and . What is the LCS or longest common subsequence problem? LCS is commonly found in areas related to artificial intelligence and computer science, such as speech recognition, machine learning, and computer games. A common method used for finding the longest common substring between two strings is to sort characters in both strings in ascending order. In a match for string 1, this substring is always of length . 2) You have found a common substring, but the substrings are different in lengths. The subsequence is a sequence of the set of the given strings. The longest possible substring of a given input string has some sort of logic attached to it. 3) You have two common substring matches. String is commonly used as an attribute for a text column. Example 1: Input : X = \"ABCCW\" K = \"AC\" Output: LCS = \"AC\" Example 2: Input : X = \"AGAAAAGC\" K = \"AG\" Output: LCS = \"AGAA\" Example 3: Input : X = \"DABACABBCCAA\" K = \"DAB\" Output: LCS = \"DABCCAA\" For Subsequence Problem: Problem Statement: There are 'n' words listed in a dictionary, and it is known that two words are anagram of each other if they can be rearranged to equal each other's sequence of letters. Here i=1,j=1. The LCS problem has a well-known linear time algorithm and has been studied in the areas of automata theory, databases, machine learning, and operations research. Example: Enter two numbers and the program accepts the two numbers, first add the values and then subtract the second from the first and print the answer. Let us see how we can use substring or the subset in different ways to achieve this logic. First, for the first character of the string s, we iterate over all indices i,j and j,k in which i and j are characters of s and k is one character in the string x. If two strings are anagrams of each other they share a common, or \u201cperfect\u201d prefix with an equal number of characters. In this approach, we will create a substring function that accepts as input the original string from which to create a substring and a substring index as input. Input: S = \u201cAABCCCCAA\u201d, T = [A, B] Output: CC Input: S = \u201cABCCAABB\u201d, T = [A, B, C] Output: AABB Input: S = \u201cAA\u201d T = [KK] Output: AA Please do not copy this code directly, but do read through it. Length of the longest common substring in the input given array is the answer. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string. The LCS problem has numerous applications in many scientific fields, including: Note that the LCS problem is often stated in terms of finding the subsequence that is a common prefix or suffix of two given sequences (e.g., the longest common prefix or suffix in a two-parameter sequence). It's called \"longest common substring\" because it's a substring that is in common to both strings. The longest common substring (LCS) is a topic in the field of computer science and information theory that is relevant for the text mining and language modeling. It returns list of strings if length of max_length is greater than the length of longest_substring. The function should run in linear time, that is, the time is a linear function of the input length . And subscripts is a subsequence are anagrams of each other they share a common, or perfect.

Python Program to find Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray. The idea behind the solution is to keep an array, which stores the maximum sum of subarray. One idea is to keep track of the sum of elements in the subarray we\u2019re currently building. (I actually implemented a solution for this using only linear complexity in the amount of time and space used, but it doesn't use much less space than the algorithm below. In some subproblems of it, the solution needs to compute the maximum sum subarray for a given subarray. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the subarray of length (minimum in the array) that has the largest sum. For example, the largest sum subarray of {5, 2, 3, 1, 4} is {2, 3}, which is the segment of this sum that contains no gaps. A subarray is a continuous sequence of elements taken from a larger set. However, for N \u2265 3, we get the segment {4,3,2}. The time complexity O(N) is due to the fact that in each iteration, we need to check the entire subarray (which has size N). SubArray to find the Largest Sum. Given an array of size N, find a subarray with the largest sum (and return that sum). 2) Find Subarray with maximum sum. Given an array of positive numbers, find a sub-array with largest sum. Given an array positive numbers, returns the subarray having maximum sum. 6. A sub-array is just a sub-group of an array, where elements within that group share both the upper bound and lower bound which defines the array itself. Given an array of numbers, we have to print the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum. Note the two cases: If the segment contains at least two elements (and the first element is not zero), the maximum sum is S[len(a)]. Problem: Find the Subarray having Maximum Sum in an Array. Given an array of numbers, we have to find the maximum sum subarray in the array. The subarray (2,3,4,5) in the given array has a size of 4 and the sum of its elements is 12. #include #include // #include #include // #include. There are several ways to solve this problem given a set of numbers. If there are no holes (so no gaps) in the array, pick the leftmost element and ignore the rest. Given a positive number [N], an array of N positive integers is given. Find Largest Sum Subarray Using Divide and Conquer Divide and conquer is an algorithmic technique that solves problems recursively. We need to find all subarrays and return the maximum sum. The main goal of this algorithm is to find a subarray with the maximum size. There are lots of questions covering this on LeetCode but I will tackle the problem from a different perspective. Given an array with no duplicates, find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum. For the below subarray we will see the maximum is 8. Problem: Given an array of positive integers, return the subarray with maximum sum in it. You can find this solution here. The solution that worked for me was to not use recursion (this is because I don't know how recursion works yet, so I can't make recursion a viable option), but rather use dynamic programming. If the sum is greater than max then it also increases as max=max+(number in the subarray) Sum up all the numbers in the array in the for loop and compare them with. Let's see how to solve this problem using dynamic programming. Examples. For example, if the input is -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4, then the max sum subarray would be [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]. This video is unavailable. A subarray is a continuous sequence of elements taken from a larger set. Contiguous Subarray. I will be explaining this problem using two examples here. Fill in subarray with consecutive elements to create sum. 1- 5, 2- 2, 3- 10, 4- 1 is 1256, which is the max. 2) Fill in array with consecutive elements to create sum for each sub array. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the subarray of length (minimum in the array) that has the largest sum. Given (possibly unsorted and/or duplicates) input array (let's call it A) with N elements, return a sub-array which has the largest sum. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the subarray of length(minimum in the array) that has the maximum sum. Example 1: Input: arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 8] Output: 27 Example 2: Input: arr = [8, 0, 7, 6, 5] Output: 37 Note: When you cut the array at 0 it would still be [8, 5]. Given an array A and two integers left and right, find the maximum sum subarray in the array. The subarray is [5,7,8,2]. The algorithm is like this. Contiguous Subarray. Given an array of positive numbers, returns the subarray having maximum sum. For example, if the array is {1, 2, 3, 4} then one of the subarrays is {1,2,3} while another one is {1,2,4}. Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum. Explanation:. For example, the maximum sum subarray of -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 is [-2, 1, -3, 4]. SubArray to find the Largest Sum. If it has a gap(break) the subarray will be returned as an empty list, and an error would be returned for if the array is not sorted in ascending order in the range [0,N). Given a sorted array of N integers, return the maximum sum of a subarray formed by two successively larger segments of the array. In this approach, we will be maintaining a variable which holds the largest sum of a subarray we created till now. Solution: Consider an array [1,. 6. The idea is to keep a track of the largest sum we have seen till now. Given a positive number [N], an array of N positive integers is given. And for (3,4), the sum is 5. This means we will build our solution using dynamic programming. Given an array of length N, find the sum of the largest contiguous subarray. We'll keep the max sum and largest subarray in a HashMap. If the sum is greater than max then it also increases as max=max+(number in the subarray) Sum up all the numbers in the array in the for loop and compare them with. Consider two arrays A and B; A is the input array with K+1 elements. Sum Subarray with Largest Sum. The idea is that for each element, we know how its inclusion affects the sum; when an element is added, if the sum is maximum, it is kept, if not, it is removed. Given an array of numbers, we have to find the maximum sum subarray in the array. Note: If the given array is empty then the method. Given an array of numbers, we have to find the maximum sum subarray in the array. Given an array of positive integers, return the subarray with maximum sum in it Contribute to ramesh92/leetcode_java_daily development by creating an account on GitHub. The subarray (2,3,4,5) in the given array has a size of 4 and the sum of its elements is 12. The idea behind the solution is to keep an array, which stores the maximum sum of subarray. Find Largest Sum Subarray Using Divide and Conquer Divide and conquer is an algorithmic technique that solves problems recursively. Python Program to find Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray. It helps find the subarrays of the array where the sum is maximum and prints it. Sum the elements in each subarray and sort the. The goal is to find the sum of the elements of maximal length (subarray). The algorithm is as follows: Build a table of all [N] sub-arrays (lengths <= N). For example given numbers 3,8,4,2,2,6,8,9,1,6,2 you will find the subarray that contains the sum of 261 and that is 8,4,2,2. Examples. Example 1: Input: arr = [5,3,6,2,7] Output: 10 Example 2: Input: arr = [1,2,5] Output: 2 For the above input, the largest sum subarray is length one, so return 5. Maximum Contiguous Sum The problem statement says that after choosing the element from the input array that has the maximum contiguous sum , each element in the chosen sub array will be used only once. Given input array, build an array of maximum sum with it. The subarray (2,3,4,5) in the given array has a size of 4 and the sum of its elements is 12. In the last video, we took first array element, then we compute the sum of all subarrays starting from that element. Given an array. Explanation: If the largest sub array would be the first one, the result is 1. Given an Input Array (Input: arr, n, sum, i ), return a sub-array which has the largest sum in it. Given n, find the maximum sum subarray of numbers where at least one of the numbers is 0. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the subarray of length (minimum in the array) that has the maximum sum. The subarray (2,3,4,5) in the given array has a size of 4 and the sum of its elements is 12. I will be explaining this problem using two examples here. We do this for every number - n. Find the SubArray (sub-list) of input_numbers having the maximum sum by iterating through the set and computing maximum sum sub array at every step. Given an array positive numbers, returns the subarray having maximum sum. 2) Fill in array with consecutive elements to create sum for each sub array. Now I try to explain it in the step by step manner for our reference. \u05b7& zijn qual lecture\ud654\uac15\uc5d0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the subarray of length (minimum in the array) that has the maximum sum. The idea behind the code is that for each element, the sum is computed incrementally until an element is larger than the maximum thus far. Given an array of positive numbers, return the subarray having maximum sum in it. There are many strategies to solve this question. Now we have a total sum of 40 that gets added to the previous array's max sum. Given an array A , we want to find the maximum sum subarray. You are given an array [nums] where nums[i] is the sum of elements { i , i - 1 , i - 2 , \u2026, 1 }. Then it becomes 9 which is bigger than 6. Given an array of number of the size N+1 where first number is present as 1 then next will be a positive integer (N+1) where we will have to find the maximum sum of the array with N elements from it where first element can't be zero. For example, if you have array [20, 100, 5] and you want to find sum of longest array containing only one 0, the result will be:. I am taking for test case 3, (1,2,3,4,5), my subarray is [2,3,4,5] that is sum is of length 4, which is larger than other subarrays, so I return the sum of length 4 as maximum sum. Given a sequence of real positive integers nums, compute the size of largest contiguous subarray with positive sum. Given an array of numbers, we have to find the maximum sum subarray in the array. The idea is to keep a track of the largest sum we have seen till now. The goal is to find the sum of the elements of maximal length (subarray). Given a sorted array of positive integers, return the subarray of length(minimum in the array) that has the maximum sum. For the above input, the largest sum subarray is length one, so return 5. Maximum Sum Subarray Given An Array - In this step by step example, you will learn how \" Maximum Sum Subarray Given An Array \" works. Given an array of size N, find a sub-array with largest sum (and return that sum). The array must contain at least one number. If every subarray is maximal(no other sum bigger in an array). There are several ways to compute the maximum sum. Find Largest SubArray Of A Given Array With Single Digit Numbers. The idea behind this solution is: given an integer array arr, we build a map nums with index i as key and arr[i] as value. Given a list of integers, output the index of the largest sum subarray. If it has a gap(break) the subarray will be returned as an empty list, and an error would be returned for if the array is not sorted in ascending order in the range [0,N). Given a sequence of real positive integers nums, compute the size of largest contiguous subarray with positive sum. Now suppose we have sum of this given sub array. In the last video, we took first array element, then we compute the sum of all subarrays starting from that element. For example, if the input is [20, 100, 5], then a valid solution is the subarray [100, 5]. Given a. Given a positive number [N], an array of N positive integers is given. Given a sorted array of N integers, find the subarray of length (minimum in the array) that has the maximum sum. The idea is to keep an array, which stores the maximum sum of subarray. We will be using 2 for loop to solve this sub problem. Contiguous Subarray. The subarray (2,3,1) in the given array has a size of 3 and the sum of its elements is 7. Given an array of integers, your task is to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in that array. This time, you are given an array, of which the majority is 0. A subarray is a subset of an array. Given a sorted array of n numbers, write a function to find the subarray with largest sum. Given a sorted array of N positive numbers and an integer K (the maximum sum in the array), return the subarray which has the largest sum in the array and whose sum is equal to K. Given an array, find the largest contiguous subarray with all elements positive. Fill in subarray with consecutive elements to create sum. In some subproblems of it, the solution needs to compute the maximum sum of subarray for a given subarray. We will be using 2 for loop to solve this sub problem. We will assume that input_numbers is of size n. Write a program to find the maximum sum of positive numbers in a given array. Given a sequence of real positive integers nums, compute the size of largest contiguous subarray with positive sum. If there are no holes (so no gaps) in the array, pick the leftmost element and ignore the rest. Given an array [1, 3, 11, 12, 14, 16], the output should be 16, which is the sum of numbers starting from 16. Given a sorted array of numbers, return the index of the largest sum subarray. We'll keep the max sum and largest subarray in a HashMap. In each iteration, we add the new element to the given subarray and then compute the sum of the newest element and subarray. 2) Fill in array with consecutive elements to create sum for each sub array. The idea is that for each element, we know how its inclusion affects the sum; when an element is added, if the sum is maximum, it is kept, if not, it is removed.

So the sub-array of length 3 has the maximum sum. Given an array with no duplicates, find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum. Find Largest SubArray Of A Given Array With Single Digit Numbers. There are lots of questions covering this on LeetCode but I will tackle the problem from a different perspective. Maximum Contiguous Sum The problem statement says that after choosing the element from the input array that has the maximum contiguous sum , each element in the chosen sub array will be used only once. In the last video, we took first array element, then we compute the sum of all subarrays starting from that element. If there are no holes (so no gaps) in the array, pick the leftmost element and ignore the rest. The solution that worked for me was to not use recursion (this is because I don't know how recursion works yet, so I can't make recursion a viable option), but rather use dynamic programming. Given a positive integer K, we need to find subarray with maximum size and sum equal to K. (I actually implemented a solution for this using only linear complexity in the amount of time and space used, but it doesn't use much less space than the algorithm below. If the sum is greater than max then it also increases as max=max+(number in the subarray) Sum up all the numbers in the array in the for loop and. Given an array of size N and we have a positive integer, we need to find the largest number in the sum of. Here is just a of summing up all elements of the largest sum. (I actually implemented a solution for this using only linear complexity in the amount of time and space used, but it's not much space used. Problem: Given an array positive numbers, find the largest subarrays for the with sum. Given an array of numbers, return the largest. Given an input array, return the elements which array with index-1, return the highest contiguous subarray of largest sub and a range (n, where element of length sum of all (e[i]. For example, the array element is 12, wherei+ all elements in an elements in the largest subare of the size of the array. Given an array, find the index of the subarray of the size of a positive numbers, find the largest sum of the largest sum. If there are given the sum of n in an array that is maximum. Given an array of all its sum of the sum given arr[0. The input[3, Given in an array is [nums in the max sum with the array. Filling largest sum summing 3, sum is of the largest sum of the largest in the nums sum of the size of the sub. Given n, is the index by returning a the return the size/3.", "num_tokens_generated": 4391, "OGF": 1.072021484375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 111.50871539115906, "success_ogf1": 1, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 286, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

We have 114.7 for a reason. :)\nThe 114.7 m file are the 1k sequences I posted. I do not know yet, what is contained in the 512 m file. I suppose most sequences are in there. Some part of 114.7 could be re-used? I will check...\nAs for 200+T, 114.7 was not necessary, but it was still used. No big deal I guess, the point is, to be able to open the big file without any problems, and the point still counts... (for me ;))\nMaybe in the past, some users asked for 114.7 to help other users to read the file?\nAnyway I am not sure it is needed, because I used the other big file (577M) and I guess the 114.7 file content is not so different from this 577 M file (I checked them by comparing the first lines).\nCan the 500+ T file be opened with the fasta command? The problem might be then that the 114.7 file is already used to access the database...\n500+T works for me, as does 114M. 1147M does not..\nI have had this question, but I have not checked exactly: can we change the line number in fasta files? For example, could we change the line number 2 in 577M and 255 in 114M? Would it work in 500T?\nI don't really have any problem with the 114MB file, I can open it without problem in MAFFT or FastMaker with the parameters I used.\nWhat are you using for the BLAST search (Blastall or BLASTp)? Is the problem specific or it affects both?\nI am using BLASTall. If I use the line 255 and the file format \"dna\" for input in FastMaker, I get the segmentation fault. For the 114M file, it's OK, but for it the BLAST result are very poor (the number of unique \"hits\"), I guess it's a BLAST problem due to the big file and not of FastMaker, but just to make sure, I use BLASTal, but no, nothing, I still have the segmentation fault. (I use the exact same parameters in both BLASTers...). Maybe MAFFT is a new problem with FastMaker, but as I use the default parameters, I could not test something else with MAFFT (as I can't do for BLAST, sorry for that I don't use the same parameters in both because they are different, MAFFT doesn't work on any big files, but it works well on big files with BLAST as long as you use default parameters, but they are different I believe, so I can't use exactly the same parameters in both, and no MAFFT with large files does not work by default on BLAST, this is a bug on FastMaker (or MAFFT.cgi) which is fixed in recent FastMaker...\nAnyway I don't know exactly what's the problem, so your comments are really appreciated...\nAs for the content of the BLASTall file, yes, it's the exact same format of the other file, so we can assume it's not the BLASTall format problem.\nI suppose the problem is that, even if the file size is not a problem for fasta (which is not the case for the 114M file), I guess the result can be very big (which can be a problem for FastMaker, and maybe something else? or only FastMaker for large result).\nJust as an indication, for the default parameters (FastMaker), the file is 320090, and for the default parameters (BLASTall), it is 9113367. When I use the same parameters in both programs, I have segmentation fault for result 320090. This shows it's not a question of size (it's the result of the parameters used), and we can suppose that it's a problem of FastMaker and/or BLAST which are not capable (for such result by default) of handling such a big input file. So I am not sure it's a problem of FastMaker, we should maybe check the parameters used by FastMaker, for both BLASTers and FastMaker.\nBut, I don't know which is the problem (maybe both). Maybe I should try it for other programs, I don't know.\nAnd I still did not test the 500M file (it's too big to test it here)...\nSo, what file do you guys have problems reading?\nHave you seen the BLAST page on Bioinformatics.it (that's where I found out about the big file)?\nAlso, is the BLAST result good?\nI don't have any difficulty opening the files or seeing the results - as long as no alignment/search results exceed a certain size (which can only be fixed in BLAST if it's the real problem, IIRC, as long as the memory size is sufficient).\nIf you need any additional help in terms of diagnose (what parameters do you use?), please let me know!\nI have been having problems reading the 577 M and 114 M fasta files, but I'm not having trouble reading the 1147 M fasta file.\nThere does not appear to be any problem with searching with an output of 255 hits or smaller sequences, I tried that as well.\nI'm not sure on the problem with blast.\nTo try and solve the problem, I tried to open and examine the 517 M file directly in \"Fast View\" and it shows the file as being 98,110,530 bytes rather than the reported 508,337,700 bytes, so there may be a truncation problem somewhere.\nI used the BLAST parameter \"show contigs\"\nI guess we can conclude that the file is not fully loaded?\nFor BLAST, the problem is fixed if I use the default parameters (from the BLAST menu).\nFor FastA and FASTA.cgi, I'm not sure, I don't know if the big file causes a problem, but FastA.cgi seems to open the file OK as well as FastMaker. (Maybe the problem is I forgot to set the BPB parameters, and we don't know the number of hits, so we just have a segmentation fault).\nI will ask what the parameters are... (the problem about memory, is probably also that memory (RAM) is not good enough, but we are using the same options on the large file and the little file, so, RAM should not be the problem).\nI'm sorry for those problems, but, if it's a problem of the software I believe it's not the software's problem.\nI believe this problem is a problem due to some file format problem, or a problem with BLAST parameters, but, in all cases, I believe it's not the software's problem.\nYou were saying you had difficulties in opening the file (FASTA.cgi and FastMaker): I don't know what is the problem, (RAM maybe? But we use different parameters and it doesn't help, so I suppose it's not the RAM memory problem...\nMaybe there is some problem with the input file (BLAST option)? We can ask what the parameters are... (because if there is a problem when using the default parameters, then, if we use the default parameters like we did before, we still have a problem!).\nI ask you to be patient, maybe it will not be useful, but if I know what is the problem I can solve it, or at least, we can conclude that the problem is not the software, so I can report that, and, in that case, I will provide you with a better software for the large files I believe.\nIt really would be very useful, for other problems as well (like this one on the line number issue (500 M file)).\nIf there is no problem I should also be able to use the file with the search results, there is not a problem I suppose?\nSo thanks again for your help, if it were a software issue, I don't know really if I could do more...\nSorry I thought you were saying you were having problems reading the \"500,000,000\" fasta file in Blast. Not the other two - so I wasn't sure.\nI did have problems just loading the file as a .fasta file for examination. It loaded okay when I chose to use the file as a gff file however.\nMy apologies for any confusion I might have caused.\nI am using the default parameters for the blast tool and the file size is just under 500 million I think. I just assumed you were using the default parameters as well.\nI did try the search with default parameters, and there was no problem (255 hits), I only did a comparison on the result, nothing with the BLAST itself, or search, but as search result are 255 sequences, there would be no problem.\nSo I am sorry for any misunderstand, I was only saying the problem is in the result, not in the searching process as far as I see (when I had the same parameters, the search itself was OK, the problem is with the final BLAST result).\nThe BLAST result are not fully loaded? Yes, I see no problem neither.\nI think I also think the problem is not in the FastMaker or FastA as far as I see, but maybe the BLAST \"show contigs\" parameter. I ask what the parameters are, as it seems to get the same parameters for the default BLASTing process, so maybe I need to modify the input parameters of the \"show contigs\" to be the same as for BLAST, or vice versa to make things shorter (but I don't know if it's the problem...).\nI still don't know what the problem is but I will ask what the parameters are (it's only to help, sorry if it's troublesome...).\nAs an additional information, it was not always a problem to blast (or at least, not all the time), I had the problem maybe only last couple of days, before a few of us were using the big BLAST files, as far as I remember.\nI have to admit I'm not sure about the BLAST parameters. I did use a default setting. If you want you could go ahead and email me your request, and I will see if I can post the parameters here.\nI'm a little confused by FASTA.cgi showing the file as >508,337,700 b, the file that FastA.cgi showed as 3,200,90 bytes (which is a problem, I think) and what you see as 98,110,530 bytes. Perhaps you could screenshot these results for me?\nI'm not sure I'm following all this exactly, but perhaps we need to go over the same problem at different levels.\nWe can agree that we're not sure what is happening. We know that\n1) It is not a RAM problem.\n2) It is not a big file problem [I suppose, as it's not a problem either in FastA.cgi and FastMaker].\n3) The big file is not opening with BLAST all right (at least, I don't know if we can assume that as we don't know the parameters nor the result yet, maybe the parameters are not suitable?).\nSo, what remains is maybe the problem of the BLAST search result... (what ever the parameters I guess, as at least 2 different programs give error).\nThe file I'm using is the 500M big file, by the way.\nWhat we can try is, as we know now that RAM is not a problem, and FastA.cgi and FastMaker are not showing problems, we can try to look into the BLAST search results. But before doing it, I think we should know exactly the parameters used, just in case.\nThat's what I want to get on this thread really.\nThere is a lot of information now, but I guess we have still to check what the parameters used are...\nDo you have any idea what may be the problem, as otherwise we don't know if it could be something the software could not manage etc.\nIf you're able to get the parameters at all, they'd be very helpful, so I can go from there.\nI do know that I didn't have these problems just recently and that I was able to blast a few times to obtain the very big files you've talked about.\nSo I'm not quite sure what's going on - as I said in my last post, if I'm not mistaken -, but still trying our best to work on it.\nYou might have some problems because in the past month or two there have been some changes in how the BLAST searches were run. I'll be sure to check them out tomorrow.\nIn your opinion, how difficult should I consider this problem to be, as a software problem? (not for BLAST in general, but for FASTA.cgi)\nAre you sure that the search and search result are the same? It may not be the problem as we don't even know if the results are good, they may not be even good at all!\nI am not sure this can be considered a problem of the software (FASTA nor FastMaker), because they do not have any problem with a big file, nor with a smaller result file, only the problem is with BLAST. So if it's not a software problem, it would be, I think, a software's error, and that is not only the case for what we have.\nI can try to solve all this by fixing all the parameters etc., but with no success as it doesn't work.\nSo, the problem I know is the line number problem, the parameters of BLAST are not a problem as we can use the same parameters in FastMaker and we get the same result as in BLAST without the need of a special FastMaker parameters.\nThe only problem I know is the line number problem, although I still do not know what is the problem exactly.\nI don't know really if the problem I have with the line number is not the same as the problem for blasting a big file. So I will try it myself by checking all the parameters of FASTA.cgi, as I did not make test here anyway (as FASTA.cgi does not have any error message here IMO, so I do not know whether I have used the right parameters or not. I've tried a few times, but never got time to check them all to be careful enough to know if it was really all right...)\nI suppose BLAST should be the same (FastMaker, FASTA.cgi, and BLAST all give error), but I will check it this evening.\nI can't say it's the same as I have no idea what is the problem.\nBut it would make sense if it's a similar problem actually...\nI've checked all parameters in FASTA.cgi, I cannot recreate the error (for the line 255, blasting a big file I believe is not the problem), so, I suppose the problem is only the blasting.\nI've tried this evening, and I had no problem (no error message for line number 255).\nI've tested BLAST also and I have not problem with the line number (no error).\nIt doesn't change anything for me but I can assure you that it is easy to get the 500M fasta file to open. You can even open the 3.2M or the 100M versions in FASTA.cgi.\nI did an experiment earlier and when I opened the 2M file as it was the case on FastMaker, I used the fasta program to remove it the line number 2 but I got no error, and BLAST also works fine (with 255 hits).\nSo the problem I have may be solved, but I am not sure (I tested FASTA.cgi yesterday and it worked with the 500M fasta file, but the 114M and 1147M and the 320K file had no problem with FastMaker and BLAST).\nIt could be solved just because I changed the parameters in FASTA.cgi?!?!?!?\nWell, I still don't know what the problem is (and it was really important information for me, as I was trying to find a way to get results with the line number removed for blasting a big file). But I think it's OK and no problem...\nSo I think it's solved.\nBut I'll wait a little bit, to make sure (still, it's very easy to recreate the big file, and just use 255 hits, as I did before, to see if it's really the problem).\nI will be a bit busy until next week, but I'll post again to let you know if I do find any problem, or if it's really all right...\nI've checked with the smaller file too, and I still have no problem (and FASTA.cgi).\nOK, good.\nI've already sent the FASTA parameters.\nSo it does not look like it's a FASTA cgi problem.\nOK, I'll just do the BLAST thing. If it's so, it does not make sense the BLAST search does not work all right, as the it's still easy to get any big file (as we're\nOK, I've already sent the FASTA parameters\nSo.

How to Programmatically Return the Majority Element in an Array of Integers? C program to find the majority of an array (given there is no multiple of the given no of array elements) (10 \u2139) ip=192.168.65.22 \u2139 ip show. How to find the majority of element in a matrix that satisfies given condition in Python. There are mainly two ways to find the majority element: The naive or brute force algorithm is the simplest, and it starts by iterating over the array or by using a loop and checks for the majority element. The following program provides a recursive implementation of the majority function discussed above. A majority is an element that appears more often than half of the elements in the array.

That doesn't mean you should try to figure out what he/she is talking about, since nobody but the poster knows that. He/she likely knows the answer to what he/she is doing, but the rest of us do not. Some of those who do have spent considerable resources already to attempt to help this person understand what's going on. Those individuals are rightfully frustrated to hear the OP just saying, \"I cannot solve that problem right now, but please do it for me and help me solve it.\"\nBut if you have the time, I agree with your suggestion that OP should be getting some form of compensation and should learn how to put a team of people together to get the work done.\nI get so much more accomplished in my life doing things for myself.\nIn the future, do your research or be prepared to get the answer by doing my work\nI cannot comprehend that sentence. It reminds me of the old saying, \"If you can't explain it to a sixth grader you don't really understand it.\"\nI have worked on programming many different projects for other people and even at my highest levels I would not let people just come in and do my work for me. If I did, I would not be in my career or business today or last week or last month or last year, etc...\nI work for myself and with those who can accomplish the goals themselves.\nBut of course there's always the free handouts...\nBut...I have seen people waste their lives on trying to solve someones problems...\nAnd the problem gets so complicated they have no idea how to get started.\nSo the idea is to create a framework and have people develop to the framework.\nWhich is where I had the discussion to try and get the framework.\nBecause when I asked, \"what does it look like?\", I was basically ignored with the expectation that I would work it out myself.\nAnd I don't want to create and implement it for free, I want my investment to be returned from the people who get the benefit by creating jobs.\nI have seen the fallacy of that many times...someone comes with a \"plan\" and they are looking for funding and they are looking for people to put in the work.\nAs much as I like to help someone, my time is extremely valuable and I want it returned on a higher rate of return than most \"don't work\" professions.\nSo if you understand that and have come with that knowledge, than let's start somewhere.\nBut if you truly believe your project is worthy of investment, then let's create a project to bring together a plan, goals, etc...\nBut don't waste my time if you don't have the cash.\nI cannot explain how to solve your problems so that you can create and program your own software for the OS, so please don't expect me to.\nAnd there is no way for me to be excited about what I do.\nAnd I will work with you to fix that...but only if the project is profitable.\nAin't the truth. I'd rather teach people how to work rather than do it. But I don't get it if I don't know it. And if someone doesn't know what you are trying to explain, you can't teach people something. And if you think teaching people to develop software they probably didn't understand to begin with is a viable proposition, well, you haven't been in the software biz very long, if ever.\nI have been doing this for a long time.\nWhen I want to learn something from someone, I go to that individual and discuss the topic.\nIf they don't know how to communicate, than I do my own.\nAnd you have to start somewhere.\nSomeone has to make a first step, it's easier to take the first step, then the next and then the next.\nAnd if you can't articulate the questions/answers, you cannot teach what you know to others and then you have to hire someone you cannot really trust or is truly capable.\nAnd what happens? One of the employees gets fired or goes to jail or you get a bad review from someone from your company.\nI would have gotten this done at this point, but I still have people not giving a darn about my business.\nPeople say to be a problem solver, but there are many different areas of that, and if I am going to solve things, I better be getting my work done as opposed to watching videos and doing things that don't even make me successful.\nNot to long ago, many years ago, this was not this important to companies,\nSo even with all the knowledge, I still have people not getting the results they are capable of.\nBecause they don't even know where to start.\nIn my mind, someone who wants to do something, should at least know a little about what needs to happen.\nAnd if you don't want to learn, than you are not going to be able to work in a certain industry for long.\nSo many people are doing all the wrong things and they can't understand why the industry is so difficult.\nI don't think it is difficult, even at my high levels of expertise in various industries, I don't see the difficulty, I see a lot of very talented people who don't know anything about how to use their talents.\nSo my job is to work with people to develop themselves.\nWhy? Cuz I want to help others.\nSo they are not sitting there like a zombie waiting to die.\nI feel compelled to help people, and when I can't do those things, than I find others who can.\nAnd if I can do these things, than I work with people who at least want these things for themselves.\nIn the business world, when you take the time to build an automation system that saves you the business owner time, than you can create money.\nWhy in our society are people so afraid of this?\nBut this automation system has to be created by someone who knows how business actually works.\nIf you haven't created a business before, you don't know how business works.\nSo go and get some knowledge.\nI work with entrepreneurs, and a common trait among these type of people, is that they are smart, resourceful, talented, and determined. All good traits. All good traits, but they are also very stubborn.\nThey work to create something, and once they have created it, they are scared to lose it. It's their baby! It's their first born!\nSo they refuse to create anything to help protect it.\nLike my friend used to say, \"if you do not believe you will lose, you will never defend.\"\nI have been in 3 different businesses for over 20 years in my life and every time I have to deal with these people who don't like change.\nAnd people who don't like change, cannot adapt.\nAnd the world is constantly changing.\nI am a big supporter of the American dream.\nBut that doesn't last forever.\nFor you to have the American dream, you have to constantly change, just like in nature.\nAs soon as you change, so does everyone else, and if you don't keep up with the changes, you will lose, that's all there is to it.\nIf you are too far behind the change curve, you cannot keep up.\nWhich leads me to another bad business mindset, is that a business owner doesn't like to see their employees succeed in a job.\nIf your best employee knows more than you do about your business or how things are created, than you can't keep them.\nPeople make too much money.\nIf you have employees, than you have to change your mindset that says you have to pay them more.\nYou have to look at how you can get that money to help the business.\nAnd by how you do that, is to create more automation and not make your business personal.\nYour business has to be built on an idea, on principles and on being a person of interest.\nThe thing is, if you are a business owner, and you hire employees, then you now have to create something, a business, not an idea of a business.\nSo if you create something, and you create people, then you get the joy of keeping people out of your business as well as keeping the people who are into your business.\nSounds like something you say if you have a problem.\nWell, that's what I am doing.\nI cannot solve that problem right now\nI am looking for someone who knows how to program and have some technical understanding. Then all you gotta do is figure out how to solve the problems within the project itself. You're probably right. You can't be an expert on all the technical details of any given project, including programming.\nI don't get how you don't get what I'm talking about. Someone said, \"it does not matter how much experience they have\". Who said that? If you get in way over your head and can't get out, your experience will be a hindrance. As will most anything you have going for you. Too much of a good thing can actually become and negative. Like I said earlier, the more you have and the greater your experience is, expectations will get too high and you will not be satisfied with anything less.\nThis is why it is so important to be humble. But you did not ask for humility.\nI would not listen to that advice either if you were looking for a complete and professional solution, but you want to learn how to make a computer program.\nYeah, right, like that's going to happen.\nThere is no good thing. You are looking for people to volunteer to do work for you for nothing. Just like all the people who want to win your lottery by signing your petition.\nI could not agree more! But you and I do not talk to one another. You don't talk to me at all. You just go on and on and talk without realizing that you don't have the answers and never asked any questions. You just talk and talk and talk. For your own information, it is not my problem if others don't know what I'm saying. It is yours.\nAll right, I concede. I will stop talking about software for you. But you need to know you only got to this point because I went out of my way to make it happen. I made an introduction for you and then I spent the time it took to make sure you knew who I was talking about. I knew that was going to happen because you have been in business most of your life and in the process, have been involved in some kind of project in every project you were involved in. I knew you were looking for people because I was looking for you in all my projects. So, I figured I would try to meet halfway, which I did because I knew you would probably not talk to me. So, you owe me at least half a thank you.\nBut don't be so sure. Maybe not.\nBut I would assume if you can't answer the questions I asked, you are probably not qualified to do the work you are supposedly looking for.\nAnd no, I could not comprehend that sentence either. I never asked you any questions and you never answered any.\nSo, I'll just keep answering them on my own.\nBut if you have the time\nI have all the time I need.\nNow, that doesn't mean I have the time to do what you want from me. You still don't know what I want. The only thing you know is that I want your help.\nYou cannot be so sure of yourself. I will grant you that point.\nI got nothing for you because I don't do freehand. So, just let it go for now. I can't explain it to you if you can't explain what you want done and why. I don't even know what you are expecting to learn from this discussion with the guy at the petition. If you can't explain it to me, how are you going to be able to explain it to that guy? I'm not going to go out there for you and talk to people, not to mention I'm not going to spend another dime on this because I'm already tired of this thing.\nIn all honesty, I don't get why you cannot comprehend what I'm saying. You are really not helping or understanding what I'm saying at all. I am not asking for anyone else to be my work horse. I am asking for people who can put a work team together. It is not the same thing. It actually works much better. When you put a work team together, everyone gets paid. That is why it is better.\nI have never worked for myself on this scale and this is the only time I have really done any kind of work on this scale either.\nI am working on a 3 part system.\nEveryone I talk to is saying to me they don't know where to begin.\nSo, why is that?\nBecause my friends keep saying to me the project does not look real.\nSo, how can I make it real?\nA project has to be real to make the money, if I cannot make the money, I cannot work all my life for nothing, just like everyone else.\nIf you think I am wasting my life, you're wrong.\nBecause I have been working for almost 30 years and have the skills to make the money, but I would have lost that opportunity 10 years ago if I was working like most people right now.\nI had friends who could not work 1 day a week at a job right now, but, I went back to work 12-18 hours a day, 7 days a week for the last 10 years of my life.\nWhy? Because my investment is in my abilities, which I got from years of hard work.\nYou have the ability, you are just not using it to its fullest extent.\nAnd that opportunity would still be with me 10 years in the future, just like you.

While this can be a helpful tool, it can also lead to information overload and confusion about what to trust. This is especially true when it comes to online articles and opinion pieces written by those who are not experts in the field.\nOne example of how social media can be used for news purposes is The New York Times\u2019 \u201cThe Factor\u201d series of articles created by their data analysis team. These articles are interactive and allow readers to explore the data that the articles contain in order to better understand something that they may not be familiar with. This type of news story is very different from the traditional news style and can be a very effective way to get news out to the public.\nHow has social media changed the way that we consume and share news?\nOne of the biggest ways that social media has changed the way that we consume and share news is through the way that we share information. Not only are we now able to find and share information quickly and easily, but we\u2019re also able to connect with others who are interested in the same topics. This allows us to broaden our news sources and become more informed about current events.\nThe rise of fake news has also had a major impact on how we consume and share news. Fake news is an untrusted and unauthorized story or article that is posted on social media with the intention to mislead readers. Fake news is different from satirical news sites like The Onion, which are clearly fictional accounts meant to make people laugh. Satirical news is protected by the First Amendment and helps us to understand political issues in a fun and clever way.\nHow can we be sure that the information we are sharing is accurate?\nWhen communicating with someone on the internet, it is important to be mindful of the source of the information you are sharing. Online articles can be written by anyone and are not always a reliable source of information. It is important to ensure that you are being as careful as possible when you share and consume online news. If you do not have access to a newspaper or other printed media, make sure to check the source of the article you are reading to see if it is reputable. Remember to also be cautious about websites that are known to sell counterfeit goods or offer fraudulent services. While these websites might seem like a great source for news, they often contain false or misleading information. Always be wary of anything that looks too good to be true and take the time to research any company or product before trusting them.\nThe internet has changed the way we consume news and information and can be both a useful tool and a cause of confusion. It is important to be mindful of the source of the information you are sharing and take the time to research any company or product before trusting them.\nSatirical news is another example of how social media can be used to share news. Satirical sites like The Onion are fictional accounts meant to make people laugh and can be an effective way to get news out to the public.\nFake news is an untrusted and unauthorized story or article that is posted on social media with the intention to mislead readers. Fake news websites can look completely legitimate and offer false or exaggerated stories.\nSocial media can also be a great way to connect with others who are interested in the same topics. This allows us to broaden our news sources and become more informed about current events.\nWhen communicating with someone on the internet, it is important to be mindful of the source of the information you are sharing. Online articles can be written by anyone and are not always a reliable source of information. Make sure to check the source of the article you are reading to see if it is reputable.\nTake care when consuming online news as scam sites are common on the internet. Do not trust any company or product before researching them.\nHow can we ensure the accuracy of news shared on social media?\nIn order to ensure accurate news, there are many steps that can be taken to ensure the validity of what is being shared on social media. First, make sure that you are always checking the source of the story you are reading before sharing it. Not all news is accurate and some sites may have an inclination for skewing information in their favor. It is important to check the legitimacy of any story shared before passing it on.\nAdditionally, it is important to question the credibility of any news shared on social media. Just because something is published does not guarantee that it is true. Many stories on social media are outdated or misguided. Always be mindful of the source of information you are sharing with friends and family to avoid passing on inaccurate or inflammatory news.\nBy being cautious of where we get our news from and what we read, we can all help make sure that our news is as accurate as possible. With so much information being shared online, it is important to take extra steps to verify the accuracy of all sources. This will not only help ensure that you are getting the most up-to-date information, but it will also help to protect your online privacy.\nWhat should be done to ensure the accuracy of news shared on social media?\nWhen it comes to social media, there are a few things that we can do to stay safe and avoid sharing inaccurate news. First and foremost, we need to be mindful of the sources of the information that we\u2019re sharing. Just because something looks good on social media doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Secondly, we need to be aware of what our intentions are when we\u2019re sharing information online. We must remember that our audience is made up of a wide variety of people who may or may not share our political opinions.\nLastly, it\u2019s important to be careful of what we post and how we post it. As social media evolves, so too does the responsibility that comes with it. Be sure to consider whether or not your post will have a negative impact on your audience. A post that ridicules an individual or group of people may have unintended consequences and could escalate into a bigger issue.\nSocial media can be used in many ways to create accurate news. There are many sites available that allow us to share our findings with others and create information that is accurate and reputable. Sources should be checked to make sure they are reliable, and the information they are shared with should be checked for accuracy. By following these steps, we can ensure that the news we share is accurate and reputable.\nOnline information sharing is not limited to the Internet. People share information about events, news, and information through social networking as well. Many people use social media to get updates from news sources, share memes and other interesting content, and sometimes even talk about controversial topics.\nThis article will discuss how information sharing through social media has changed. The article will also discuss what changes have been made to increase the effectiveness of news sharing through social media. The article will end with some tips for how best to share online information.\nSocial media has been around since the 1990s, but it has only become a widely used tool in the last few years. When social media first became popular, it was only available on desktop computers and smartphones. Now, social media is available on most devices, including smartwatches and gaming consoles. There are also many different types of social media platforms, each with its own set of features and functions.\nSome people might say that social media is more effective at sharing information than traditional print or radio media. There are several reasons for this. First, because social media is so popular, it has the potential to reach a wide audience. Second, social media platforms allow for two-way communication, which can be useful for keeping an informed public. And finally, social media platforms are constantly changing, which can be difficult to keep up with.\nAlthough social media seems to have many advantages over traditional media, there are also potential downsides. Some people worry about privacy issues and how much data companies collect about users. Others wonder if social media is really helping people stay informed or just leading them down rabbit holes of false information.\nOverall, whether or not social media is effective at sharing news likely depends on what type of news you want to share and what purpose you want it to serve. If you want people to stay informed on current events, using social media platforms might be a good option. However, if you want people to know more about your own interests or experiences, social media might not be as effective at communicating that information.\nHow do people use social media to share news?\nPeople share news through social media in different ways. Some people might post an article to their profile or blog and ask others to share the link. Others might create a social media site specifically for sharing news with others. Those who are interested in political news might subscribe to blogs or follow accounts on Twitter that share political updates or live reporting from events around the world.\nIn addition to creating their own social networks for sharing news, some people use social media as an outlet for distributing information to large groups of people. For example, celebrities often take to Twitter and Facebook to share their thoughts on current events or to promote their new album or movie.\nSocial media also offers opportunities for businesses and organizations to reach new audiences with their products and services. By utilizing social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, companies can connect with customers who might otherwise never see their products or services.\nTips for How to Share News on Social Media\nIf you are looking for effective social media news sharing tips, read on. This article provides an overview of some social media platforms that you can use to share your blog posts and announcements.\n1. When posting on social media, be sure to include a brief explanation about why you are posting the post and how it relates to your blog.\n2. When sharing a blog post, be sure to include an image or video that visually represents the topic at hand. This will help people understand the information more easily and increase their chances of sharing the post with others.\nWhat are social networks and how can they be used to share news?\nSocial networks are online platforms where people can connect and share information with each other. Social networks can be used for a variety of purposes, including sharing news, connecting with friends, and communicating information.\nOne of the main benefits of using social networks is that they allow users to connect with people all over the world. This can be helpful if you want to find out more about a topic or connect with like-minded individuals. Another benefit of using social networks is that they can be used to share news quickly and easily. This can be useful for reporting on breaking news or for sharing information about local events.\nHowever, there are also some risks associated with using social networks. For example, if you share information using social networks, it could be shared with other users on the platform. This could lead to privacy issues or cyberattacks. Additionally, if your information is accessed by the wrong person, it could be used against you in a court of law.\nOverall, using social networks can be both helpful and harmful depending on the user\u2019s intentions and actions. If you want to stay up-to-date on breaking news or connect with like-minded individuals, then a social network might be an effective tool for you. However, if you want to keep your personal information private or avoid potential threats, then you should be aware of the risks before using any online platform.\nHow have social media changed the way we view news?\nThere have been some big changes in the way people view news on social media lately. With the rise of fake news, it is now more important than ever to be critical of the information you share online. People used to share news based on what they thought was true, but now more and more people are questioning the accuracy of information they find on social media and other online platforms.\nThis has led to an increased focus on fact-checking and verification of news stories. Some sites, such as Snopes, have even become famous for debunking false claims that individuals spread on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\nIt should be noted that the increase in fake news has not just happened in recent years; it has been happening for decades. Prior to the rise of social media, newspapers and other media outlets were more conservative in what they published. Now, however, people are more likely to share news that is not completely trustworthy because it is easy and quick to do so.\nSocial networks have become popular platforms for distributing false information because they are easy to access and share. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat all allow individuals to share photos, videos, and stories that may not be true but are easy to share without being fact checked by the site or users themselves. This ease of sharing false information has led to an increased focus on verifying news stories before they are posted online.\nDo you know the risks and benefits of news sharing on social media?\nSharing news online has benefits and risks. Here are five takeaways on how to share news online:\n1.Be mindful of your own audience. Sharing information is great for spreading knowledge, but remember that not everyone will be interested in what you have to say. Make sure the articles or posts that you share are relevant and appropriate for the audience that you want to reach.\n2.Read articles or posts critically before sharing them. Even if an article seems reputable, it\u2019s still important to read it carefully for bias and errors. If you do come across an article that contains false information, correct the errors yourself or report them to the site admin.\n3.Be aware of how your actions can influence other people\u2019s behavior and opinions. Just because something seems like a good idea doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually smart or ethical for yourself or other people to do.\n4.Be careful with social media posts about sensitive topics, such as politics. Don\u2019t post anything personal or confidential unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Even then, be cautious about revealing too much information.\n5.Consider the consequences of what you post online before posting anything at all. Are there any risks associated with sharing this information online? Does posting something uncomfortable make me look bad in other people\u2019s eyes? Do I risk being fired if I post controversial material? These are things to consider before posting anything online.\nHow do you know the quality of news shared on social media?\nSocial media networks have allowed people to share news and information more quickly and widely than ever before. As a result, the quality of these news and information exchanges is increasingly important. Here are five ways to ensure that you are sharing accurate and reliable news on social media networks:\n1. Check out the sources for the news you are sharing. Is the article from a credible source? Is it from a respected newspaper or magazine? Does it come from a reliable news website?\n2. Compare the headlines of the article you are sharing to other news sources. Are the headlines similar? Are the pictures and video attached to the article similar to others you\u2019ve seen elsewhere? If so, it\u2019s likely that the story is accurate and well-researched.\n3. Check the dates and times on social media posts. Are they current? If not, are they outdated or irrelevant?\n4. Take a look at the number of shares and likes on a particular story you\u2019re sharing. If there are numerous shares or likes on a particular story, chances are it is popular and accurate.\n5. Read the comments sections on news stories shared on social media networks. Are people praising or criticizing the article? Are there lots of negative comments or only one positive comment? If there are lots of negative comments, it\u2019s likely that the story is misleading or completely fabricated.\nOverall, social media networks are a fantastic way to get access to information and connect with others from around the world.

Some people believe that social media is a safer way to share news and information than other types of media, such as television or radio. Others believe that social media is more effective at sharing news and information because it is interactive.\nOne way that social media can be used to share news is using hashtags.

Hashtags can also be used by government agencies to gather public opinion on different topics.\nAnother way that social media can be used to share information is by using posts or comments. Posts are updates that someone makes on their social media account. They can be either positive or negative, but they are usually meant to inform other people about a topic or event. Comments are often made on posts or articles, meaning that people share their thoughts about something. Comments are usually positive, but can also be negative.\nOverall, social media is a great way to share news and information. By using hashtags or posts, people can find relevant information easily.

to identify as \"Jewish\". In contrast, the youngest generation (18-26 year olds) was found to be the least likely to identify as Jewish, yet the most religious (for example, praying at least once a day). The researchers concluded that younger Jews are losing their Jewish culture and becoming more assimilated than their predecessors.\nAs it currently stands, our Jewish tradition does not include an institution that helps provide meaningful Jewish life and culture to younger generations. While there are plenty of programs and services dedicated to helping the youth connect with Judaism and Jewish community, we don\u2019t have a program focused on helping young adults connect with their inner Jew.\nThis is where Project Makom comes in. We at Makom want to ensure that 18 year olds become 70 year olds who are able to live rich and vibrant Jewish lives with more meaning and joy, and not less. We want to see young Israelis grow and flourish into adulthood without the risk of feeling left in the cold when it comes to the important issue of being a part of something bigger.\nI had originally envisioned Makom as an organization led by a few young (20 something) professionals in the community that would meet young adults in an informal and organic way, where people could simply share their journey as Jews and as Israelis. However, I was encouraged to open the organization to the entire community in hopes of making this work a communal undertaking.\nTo that end, I recently spoke at a meeting of an organization in Los Angeles that I am involved with and which does a lot of community education in Jewish circles. I told them that Makom is designed specifically for individuals who are searching for more meaning to their lives, and who are willing to take part in a serious spiritual journey that involves some amount of discomfort and struggle mixed in among the ecstasy.\nTheir response to this idea was a resounding \u201cAmen\u201d.\nThose who volunteered to come with me to the 29 hour fast I attended this week were a mix of secular, religious Jews, and the non-Jewish spouses of participants in this fast. We discussed and reflected on a variety of topics that were not just \u201cJewish\u201d, and yet the conversation naturally became quite Jewish. We discussed what it felt like to confront existential questions that were meaningful and engaging, and how this kind of spiritual work can be an important part of one\u2019s life. We talked about how Jewish tradition was not just a set of rules, but a set of spiritual tools that are there for us to utilize in ways which feel right within our own contexts.\nSeveral volunteers also expressed a desire to continue our conversations outside of our gatherings, and that a large part of why they are volunteering is to further that aspect of the project.\nTo this end, we have launched the Makom Forum, a private Facebook group for the volunteers and participants of Project Makom events to continue their conversation. The group is set up to be a discussion zone, not a lecture forum, where people can ask questions, or speak to their own experience.\nTo become a part of this forum, please contact me directly, and I would be happy to review your application.\nI am looking forward to hearing from you and am hoping to grow our little community to include more like-minded individuals.", "num_tokens_generated": 3378, "OGF": 0.82470703125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 82.78507280349731, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 298, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

What are some of the latest trends in computer programming?\nThe latest trends in computer programming include the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. These new technologies have allowed programmers to create more sophisticated applications that can solve complex problems. They have also made it easier for programmers to write code that is easier to read and understand.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in improving the security and privacy of mobile devices. How has this affected the coding world?\nThe security and privacy of mobile devices have always been a concern. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of hacked devices, as well as attempts to steal personal information. These activities have had an impact on the coding world by forcing coders to take steps to ensure the safety of their own code.\nRecently, there has been an increase in the use of Python for data science applications. Why is this happening?\nThere are a few reasons why Python is becoming more popular for data science applications. First, Python is a relatively easy language to learn, which means that beginners can easily get started with data science. Additionally, Python has a large community of developers who are eager to help new coders learn the language, which means that they will be able to get the help they need when they need it. Finally, Python is a very popular programming language, which means that it is likely to continue to see increased usage in the future.\nCoding is a skill that is in high demand right now. What are some of the top coding languages that are in demand this year?\nThere are a few coding languages that are in demand this year. Specifically, JavaScript, Python, and HTML are all high-demand coding languages right now. These three languages are very popular among web developers, and they're all used for creating websites and web applications.\nWhat trends do you predict for the coding industry in the next 5 years?\nI can't say for certain, but I do think that coding will become more and more essential for people who want to be successful in the business world. If you know how to code, you'll be able to find jobs in fields like software development and project management.

as creepy. If your friend actually ends up receiving this card, they are likely to be startled and offended (or at the very least, very confused about why you made up your mind to make such a thoughtful present). In order to make your card more universal, you should use language that can apply to any birthday scenario. You will also want to incorporate more humor, so that the humor won't get lost in a bunch of overzealous writing. For example, instead of writing \"Your birthday gift idea is very creative, but it can definitely come off as a little too elaborate. That being said, it\u2019s clear how much you and I care about our relationship. I hope that our little birthday surprise can help us to grow closer and appreciate each other even more,\" you might try saying \"The more I think about it, the more I realize who your best birthday friend is. No, it's not the guy who's always telling you that you're wrong or the girl who always tries to outshine you. It's me! I'm the one who's willing to be a big birthday jerk and spend the whole day baking you some sweets. I may be the worst, but I'm also the coolest. Also, I'll be totally honest, I love you,\" or something to make the card fit in with how you normally interact with your friend. \u1c65\u05b6\u05b6\u05b6\u05b6\u05b6\u05b4\u2e16\ufb44\u05b0\ufb44\u05b8\u05b0\u2009\u05dc\u05b0\ufb44\u05b4\u05b0\ufb44\u05b8\u05b0\u2009\u05b0\u05b0\u05b6\u05b8\u05b9\u05b0\u2009\ufb44\u05b0\ufb44\u05b8\u05b0\u2009\u05b0\u05b0\u2009\u05b8\u2009\u05b8\u2009\u05b8\u2009\u05b8\u2009\u12ed\u05b9\u2009\ufb44\u05b0\ufb44\u05b8:\u2009\u1b44\u190c\u1052\u1d84\u2009\u1c51\t\u05b9\u05b9\u05b0\u2009\u05b0\u2009\u05b0\u2009\ufb44\u05b0\ufb44\u05b8\u2009\u2013\u2009\u05b0\u05b7\u0280\u05b8\u05b7\u05b8\u05b0\u05b9\u2009\u05b9\u2009\u1b44\t\u05b0\u2009-. \u05b0\u1d84\t\u05b0\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2013\u2009-\u2009\u2013\u2009.\u2009-.\u2009-\nAs a rule, writing a birthday card for your friend should be about them first, and you second. Your friend should feel at ease and in good spirits after they read it. Keep things positive and lighthearted, and try not to be too obvious, direct, or overly sentimental. It's best to avoid the \"cheesy\" or \"corny\" route altogether, as this can put a damper on the mood and tone of the card. Try taking a different approach by injecting playful comedy or tongue-in-cheek humor into the mix. This will make your friend laugh and provide an entertaining read that's memorable too! Try injecting some of your personality or perspective into the card without being too self-centred. \u05b1\u05d0\u05b4\u05b2\u05c1\ufb33\u05b9\u05d5\u05b2\u05b8\u05b8\u05b2\u05b8\u05b9\u2009\u05b3\u05b7\u2009\u05b0\u05b9\u05b0\u05b9\u05b0\u05b9\u05b0\u2009\u05b0\u05b9\u05b0\u05b9\u05b9\u05b9\u05b9\u05b9\u0596\u032f \u05b9\u05b9\u05b9\u05b9\u2009-\u05ab\u2009-. \u05b0\u2009\u05b1\u05b1\u05b1\u05b7\u05b8\u05b0\u05b1\u05b8\u05b1\u05b8\u2009\u05b8\u05b0\u2e3f\u05b0\t\u05b0\u2009:\u2009\t\u05bc\u2009\u05b0\u05c1\u2009-.\nWhen you're writing a birthday card for your friend, it's best to use as few personal pronouns and proper names as possible. The goal is not to make the card about you; instead, focus on the birthday girl or boy and why she or he deserves to be celebrated. You can, of course, use an inset to reference yourself, but only if it's necessary. Your personal note is more about giving tribute and gratitude to your friend than it is about bragging about all the things that you've done or accomplished by their side. It's all about them first and you second.", "num_tokens_generated": 2313, "OGF": 0.564697265625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 54.682127237319946, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 302, "chunk_index": 9, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

It's a question that will never be answered,\" he says. \"There might be an element of truth to what people say. Somehow or the other, the Germans had a hand in things, and the world of Jainism is all about truth and nonviolence and not hurting anyone, so that is why he was a bit more reticent to tell his story. \"The fact is that while he was working with the resistance, he was never in the actual resistance. He never had a rifle or was on the frontlines. The whole focus was on gathering information. And he was in Germany between 1945 and 1946 to work on a book about Judaism and the Holocaust. But the resistance was never mentioned by anyone else other than him as far as I can tell.\nThe truth and the lie in an essay example Apart from the question on the validity of the results, there are also many questions about reliability of the examination. For example, why are the assessment criteria such as number of words and sentences so inaccurate? The idea that students may be using their own personal experience and preferences as input, and that the resulting output will be so different from other students, would be an interesting study to make. I am sure that many would also want to take a more scientific approach. It would be interesting to see if the assessment would be better and easier if an outside institution were to be able to examine the evidence. It seems that many of the main things that are missing from this study are scientific rigour in the design of the assessment and a clear understanding of the nature of the assessment criteria. It is perhaps understandable that researchers do not want to make claims about the validity of the results when a study is conducted in some kind of scientific environment. They often don't want to make the same claims when they are undertaking a more scientific study, but perhaps this is understandable. However, if we agree that there are many scientific problems with assessment, what should be the approach? Perhaps we should try to assess what happens when the criteria are modified? The main problem to tackle with this study is whether it is possible to use the criteria that were used in the study to accurately measure the validity of future assessments of the same type. There are several ways that an external institution could assist, such as developing and applying methods to measure the validity, or simply undertaking more detailed analysis of the results themselves. It may be that the method used in this study was more suitable, as it allowed students who were not given clear, accurate information on how to judge the criteria and were not sure when it was appropriate for them to do so. Perhaps in the future we will have the ability to compare methods with regard to their reliability, but for now it is clear that we cannot rely on an institution making such a claim with confidence. The truth in this study is that the outcome of the examination appears to be highly subjective and may be influenced by the context of the researchers and the conditions in which the studies were undertaken. There is no doubt this is a problem. But I am not sure that the answer is just to make sure we do not use the criteria in a clear, unambiguous way. Rather we should try to make the criteria more objective and robust. This would involve finding a way to measure the validity of a study\nWholesale Mba 2019-02-18 04:58 PDT The first thing that struck me this morning was that we may very well be living in a world where people care more about their own lives than the health of their fellow citizens. There are many things wrong with our way of life, but what is happening to the earth and human health will be far worse. I asked my Facebook friend, Lyle Buston, what he thought the state of health care was and his response was, \"Well, people are sick and getting worse. It's just that the number of people with terminal diseases is increasing because diseases have been eliminated from our health care system. People who've been in the care center for thirty years have seen the healthcare system improve. It's great for the patients and the health care system, but what happens to the human race when the earth goes down the wrong way? In a world where the human race is becoming extinct, the whole system will become dysfunctional.\" Some of the other things wrong with our way of life include our lack of self-control, lack of empathy in society, and the way people are living with themselves. \"What if it's not our fault?\" I asked Buston. \"What if we had no idea how to stop the system? For example, the number of people dying of heart disease is increasing fast because of people dying of other diseases. How can we stop the system without putting the health of people in jeopardy?\" I asked. The only answer he gave was, \"Well, if you just look at what is happening on the planet, it's obvious that the system is going up the wrong way. \"Look, I don't know whether the health care system will improve in the long run. It's a long series of problems. For a planet to have its natural cycles, all its ecosystems come into play. Nature has to adjust its cycles to deal with the population increase and human needs. The main reason we don't have diseases that are caused by pollution are that we have the right things to remove them. And that's when we have our natural problems. If we don't have the right things, then the natural problems go up, and the disease goes down. \"If there is no way, we just have to accept the fact that the earth will go down the wrong way. We may need some help from some other humans. \"If there's no way, we have to do the best we can just to survive.\" According to Buston, humans should never believe they're doing the right thing. He said the best thing they could do now is to try to think of ways to survive, but never to let their fears and anxieties become a threat that ends human life.\nIt's a really important question,\" Buston continued. \"In the future, I could see these new diseases being created in the future because of people getting sick and dying. I could also see how health care could become a threat. So we need to accept that there are things wrong with our way of life. \"We have a lot of good reasons for thinking that. I would say it's a bad idea. \"In a world where only people are born, the natural cycle of life can adjust itself. And it can do it. That's why we need the right things to remove diseases from us. And if we don't have the right things, then it's the end of humanity. \"But if you don't have the right things, you probably will have a lot of diseases.\" \"The truth is, a world where people are sick and dying is not a healthy world,\" I said. \"They can't survive without the right things for them to survive.\" \"If they could survive, the world would go on. That's why we live in a world where there's no death,\" Buston replied. \"Because they have to be able to live. But it's not the only thing that kills people. We need the people to survive. \"We have to make a good decision to keep people from having a life that's difficult to live. We have to do the best we can.\" But when I asked Buston how the health system should improve in the long run, he said, \"I think they won't. They won't do that.\" He explained that when people die, it is not because of the disease, but because of a bad combination of poor choices. That, he said, is what people can do to get themselves out of this situation. But when people get sick, he said, they do it because of the diseases. The truth is, there are a lot of diseases for people to die from, and people do die from them. And some of the diseases that people die from are caused by what's known as \"exotic metabolic\" diseases. Exotic metabolic diseases are caused by the body's inability to break down some of its nutrients, so people usually can't get these problems treated or solved. One of these, which is found in people with a certain kind of diabetes and obesity, is called diabetes mellitus. Another is called metabolic syndrome. There are a lot of other diseases that people die from, but there are also a lot of health problems that people die from. In our system, it's a little bit different.

It\u055as an opportunity\nIs it a challenge or not?\nCan someone help me with the 2018 FTA in agriculture with the U.S.? What does it mean that the EU has not yet approved the FTA? That is, will this FTA affect the trade relationship between Mexico and EU? Thank you!!\nThe FTA that Mexico will sign in 2018 with Canada, for its part, will not be with a nation such as China or the United States, but rather an advanced industrialized country like Canada with whom we will be able to develop our trade with a country that generates a large part of its agricultural products for the rest of the world. For this reason, it is necessary to take advantage of the free-trade agreement with Canada to increase and diversify our exports, improve the competitiveness of our products in the Canadian market, as well as to eliminate certain obstacles to trade and investment of these products. It is not only considered a challenge, but also an opportunity to improve our food productivity and marketing, thereby increasing food security and reducing the level of poverty.\nThe FTA represents an agreement between Canada and Mexico in which, by exchanging products at zero tariffs, it will be possible to generate mutual benefits and support the trade and commercial relations between the two countries. By reducing tariffs, among other things, it is expected that certain products will gain access at zero tariffs to the Canadian market, increasing the commercial flow of goods and goods. But on the other hand, there will also be the benefit of removing certain non-tariff barriers, which will also contribute to these trade flows. The FTA with Canada is positive for both countries since it will allow increasing trade and commercial flows of goods and commercial goods between them.\nFood security is a challenge because of the many problems we face in obtaining food, among the following problems: food distribution in countries with extreme poverty, food production problems in developed countries, and food waste due to the fact that many companies make food products that are not good. . It is a challenge because we must fight, overcome and generate economic growth by distributing more products and not food.\nThe FTA can help increase the food supply because it reduces trade barriers. It will also help to avoid any disruption in the supply of essential goods.\nHow can I find out from Mexico about the U.S. FTA 2018?\nWhat are the benefits, impacts, opportunities and challenges of 2018 FTA for Mexico with the U.S.\nWhat is the impact of the TPP on Mexico?
