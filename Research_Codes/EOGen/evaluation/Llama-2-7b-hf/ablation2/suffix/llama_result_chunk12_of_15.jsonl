PII refers to personal information, and OAuth is a protocol that is used to authorize applications to access the data of another application. In this chapter, you will learn how to use the Java API to provide authentication with these protocols. PII and OAuth\n84Chapter 18 - Authentication ProtocolsAuthenticate the Users of Your ApplicationsYou are a developer working in a company that has an app that provides food delivery services. People can place orders through the app, and they can also rate and review the food served in the restaurants that are available on the app. Some users are happy with the quality of the food that they receive from the restaurants, but some are not. Because you are the app developer, one of your responsibilities is to make sure that the users\u2019 experiences on your app are positive overall. However, some users are not real users, and these users only placed an order without paying for it. As a developer, your work to prevent fraud from these users can be made easier through application authentication. You will implement multiple authentication schemes for the users of your app. In this chapter, you will learn how to implement the protocol to prevent users from spoofing orders and also how to implement single sign-on (SSO), which can make your app more convenient for the users. PII is personal Identification information, and it is one form of authentication that uses the user\u2019s name, email address, and password to authenticate users. SSO is a method that provides a streamlined and convenient user experience on a single app. Users can access and use the apps of different companies without needing to log in repeatedly. Whenever you authenticate with another device or another company, you will need to provide your username and password again. With SSO, users can login to one app and then access the other app without providing their personal information. You will use PII and SSO protocols throughout this chapter.In This Chapter You will find out more about: How authentication protocols work How to use PII and SSO protocols How to implement a sign-in page as a form of authentication How to implement an API end point\n85to authenticate your usersHow Do Authentication Protocols Work?Authenticating your users can be done through a few methods. These methods are called authentication protocols. One of the protocols is called PII. Other protocols that you can implement in your application are OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and token authentication. In this section, you will learn about each of these types of authentication so you can understand how they can be used in your apps.Personal Identification Information (PII)ProtocolTypes of Personal Identification InformationTo begin, you should know that PII is the data needed to identify an individual. PII can vary from country to country and can include various components. PII can include a combination of identifying information with other data that could uniquely identify people such as their name, email address, address, and passport photograph. In the following sections, you will see how PII can be used in authentication.PII as an AuthenticationMethodPII was a common authentication method before the introduction of newer authentication protocols from OAuth to token authentication. With PII, an application that needed PII from the user could require specific information from the users in the sign-in or registration page such as the user\u2019s email address, name, address, or phone number. The user\u2019s username and password will then be encrypted and stored locally in the server or in the cloud. Some companies and apps have different names for their usernames. For example, some companies prefer to call the username by the user\u2019s email address in their own system. When a user signs in, the app can then fetch the necessary information and compare them with the information that was already stored in their system. The advantage of this method\n86Authenticate the Users of Your Applications is that users only required to know one unique username that they will use in the application they are accessing. However, this method can cause some security issues. These issues are the loss of the information and the users\u2019 passwords. If a user loses the password or if someone steals it, then any other app that can retrieve the username and password can authenticate with that same user\u2019s account, and that app can then give access to the user\u2019s information. You can prevent this by adding an additional authentication method or by making sure that the users\u2019 password is saved securely in their applications. Another issue is having to store users\u2019 personal information on the system because of the storage cost and security issues. If the users\u2019 personal information becomes public, then it can be used for fraudulent activity such as identity theft. PII Is Also the Name of the Authentication ProtocolPII is also a protocol for authentication that uses a combination of personal information and a password in combination such as email address and password. Using the PII protocol, you can perform an authentication and get the needed information. In the following code example, you will see the PII authentication method working as a response to a request in Postman that sends a request with the PII request with the following parameters: The username is app.User_1 The password is 123456 In this code example, the token received from the server is not encrypted and is not secure because it contains the username, which is also your app\u2019s username. This is the disadvantage of using PII as the authentication protocol. Another is that this protocol can be unsecure because the users can use their account information more than once, or they can reuse their user ID and password.\n87Chapter 18 - Authentication ProtocolsWith an app, you can authenticate using your personal identification information (PII) and password. However, when users sign in from a different browser while they are logged in on one of the browsers, they will be asked to create a new user ID and password. This is because you have chosen to prevent someone from having multiple accounts on your website. One of the ways you can do this is by creating a token for that user that they can use to access the website. The token can be used to sign in to that app without any personal information. That token can be refreshed from time to time to avoid it expiring or having an expiration time that is longer than necessary. In this way, the user is only given a unique ID that you will use for their identity and that cannot be used by another user for your website. You can also authenticate through the application program interface (API) end point. This type of authentication is where you provide a username and password on the API for the users to access your app. When access is required to view certain information, then you will use token authentication. Token authentication is used frequently in website applications. However, this type of authentication requires some work to create tokens for each user and also to store the tokens so that they will be remembered for the users to access the website. In the following sections, you will see code examples of using both of these methods.Pii ExampleCodeExampleUsing PII and TokenAuthentication1 This code example will show you how to create an application that allows you to retrieve data about a customer by authenticating with the PII and token authentication protocol. In the following code example, you can create a new Spring Boot Maven project and run it in your Postman application to try out the following code.\n88Authenticate the Users of Your Applications2 In this code example, you will create a new Java project that will be named \u201cauthentication-project\u201d.

Bernie Sanders, who has announced his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination, proposed doing exactly that on Monday. \u201cIf I\u2019m elected, one of my first actions as president will be to ask the Justice Department to open an investigation into the extent to which Apple, Amazon and other giant tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have become a monopoly,\u201d Sanders proclaimed in his announcement. The New York Times, which broke the story, pointed out, that Sanders, who was considered the most likely candidate to beat President Trump in the 2016 Democratic Primary, has called for similar probes for years and is now the second candidate to enter the 2020 race doing so. Sanders, the author of several books about income inequality and other things corporations do, would find an increasingly hostile audience in that area, among the Democrats, in the 57-county state (plus D.C.) that Donald Trump won. In 2016, for example, Sanders won over half a million votes in the Republican bastion of Orange County, California. \u201cHe\u2019s been all across the country, and he has very strong working-class and middle-class support,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, who recently hosted a podcast interview with Sanders (and we\u2019ll be posting a podcast of that soon). Sanders has shown that he can beat Trump in a lot of the areas that he needs to win; he did it in 2016 and is trying again. Pfeiffer thinks \u201che\u2019s probably our best chance right now to be the nominee.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be very careful about who is going to be our nominee,\u201d said Eric Holder, the 81st Attorney General, who hosted a podcast on Sunday with Sanders. Sanders hasn\u2019t always been as popular among progressives because he also holds a somewhat traditionalist position on guns. He opposed the Obama administration\u2019s regulation of guns after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. But those divisions exist among the Democrats. In 2016, Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton, and he held on to a good number of people who were skeptical about her. Sanders is still skeptical of her, arguing that the United States needs to reorder its health care system so that it does not rely on private insurance. And he has a more traditional view on guns than many Democrats do.\nWhat\u2019s Good for the C.E.O. Is Bad for America\nWhat\u2019s Good for the C.E.O. Is Bad for America, by Joseph E. Stiglitz (New York Times) May 20, 2019 By virtually any measure, things are going well in America. The nation\u2019s unemployment rate is near record lows, as is its trade deficit. Economic growth is solid. This is the America that the president boasts about in almost every speech. In stark contrast, the rest of the planet may be in a trade war with the United States, but this \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy looks good both for the United States and for U.S. workers. The trade deficit is narrowing fast, as President Trump\u2019s tariffs have increased prices, made consumers more reluctant to buy imported goods and discouraged further imports. Manufacturing output is rising, with automobile sales rising. U.S. exports are increasing more rapidly than imports, suggesting that we really are getting our fair share of world market opportunities and that our economy is expanding quickly. It is an impressive performance for the most powerful economy in the world. But what America should be worried about is that all this is good for one group \u2014 America\u2019s C.E.O.s and C.F.O.s \u2014 and bad for America. The latest figures show that the income share of the top 1 percent worsened last year, and income inequality increased.

Nearly 28,000 laboratories in 200 countries contributed to the project. In the end, the effort produced, among other things, a comprehensive reference for how various genes and traits affect health. The project was a textbook example of science in all its best qualities. Yet a curious thing happened as the result of its publication in late April. The New York Times reported that it was difficult to find an American news outlet to cover it. One article came from an African news site. Two stories came from outlets in Europe. The biggest story came from China. So why is the United States, a nation that still leads the world in scientific research output, the exception among developed countries that is not producing science news for its own public? \u201cThe data are shocking,\u201d said Emily Anthes, a science journalist and associate at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. She said American reporters were missing out on a vast trove of important information. Reports have shown that young people are losing interest in science-related majors. \u201cAmericans are losing touch with the rest of the world in science,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem for the nation.\u201d Why this is happening has long been a central question in the annals of international relations. On the one hand, there is science\u2019s inherent curiosity as a pursuit of knowledge. On the other, there is science\u2019s public-policy role as an engine of economic growth and political stability. It is how science intersects these two realms \u2014 one in which there is often a clash of culture and interest \u2014 that has become an increasingly fraught and important subject for American diplomacy. Scientific research is global, by its very nature, and the implications of that are immense: If a nation wants to remain competitive for scientific excellence, it must attract the best minds.\nThe 1960s and the Fall of the Golden Age of Cities\nThe 1960s and the Fall of the Golden Age of Cities, by Steven H. Wofsy (City Journal) May 15, 2019 One of the striking aspects of my study of urbanism in America at the turn of the century (the 1800s, that is) was how similar the patterns of demographic and developmental change were from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth. In the early twentieth century, of course, a nation-transforming disaster \u2014 the U.S. entry into World War I \u2014 overtook the world, and as it has done several times since, it forever changed the way that millions of Americans thought about the world and themselves. The war brought about, among other things, such phenomena as new federal agencies (the U.S. War Department became the U.S. Department of War, was divided into the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy, and was reorganized into two separate agencies \u2014 the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration), the U.S. Army and other U.S. military forces\u2019 ability to establish bases or posts close to the war zone, and a major change in the role of the U.S. military in U.S. foreign policy. And it also brought about changes in city planning as well. The most radical change in city planning occurred in the late nineteenth century in the period when urban populations were being displaced to the countryside. The early nineteenth-century American cities had been largely free of land use regulation, except for taxation, because the federal government and the colonial governments were responsible for imposing those regulations. But during the twentieth century, because cities were underpopulating the countryside to a large extent,\nIsraeli Spy Stories, Russian Hackers and CIA \u2018Deep Fakes\u2019\nJeff Sessions is an unconventional character. The former attorney general is a Southern gentleman with conservative principles and an eclectic taste in music. One of his favorites is a song by the rock star Frank Zappa. That is why it probably came as quite a shock to the people he was speaking with in Moscow in 2016 when a video on his cellphone began playing. The music was a Zappa song called \u201cDon\u2019t Step on a Bee.\u201d The video then turned into a cartoon about a young couple hiking in the woods. The wife spots a bee, scares it off and in so doing, accidentally steps on a large wasp in the process. When she starts to scream, her boyfriend turns her around to look at what is happening and she kills him when she sees his genitals in his underpants. The video then cuts to a shot of a bee stuck in someone\u2019s nostril and the lyrics: \u201cThere\u2019s a bee in my bed! There\u2019s a bee in my bed! There\u2019s a bee in my head! There\u2019s a bee in that hole in your head! There\u2019s a bee in that hole in your head. There\u2019s a bee in that hole in your head.\u201d It was Sessions\u2019s cellphone that was displaying the video, and he was the last person in the room who had seen it. The conversation he had been engaged in had involved discussions about spying and espionage between the U.S. and Russia. Sessions was a frequent visitor to St. Petersburg, where he was speaking in this particular instance, and where the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was in the midst of his first term in office. Sessions\u2019s cell was the most sensitive of the many devices that were confiscated, searched and returned to the attorney general\u2019s aide, Brian D\u2019Agostino, the following weekend at a small hotel in northern Italy, where the group had traveled, along with the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, a former CIA analyst and a group of senior White House staffers and their families. Sessions and the others were at a gathering sponsored by the C.I.A. of Russian spies and analysts to mark the 150th birthday of the C.I.A. Sessions would explain a few weeks later in a Senate hearing that, although he had not heard the song before, it had occurred to him that he might be in the room of a Russian spy when the video came on and that he had wondered whether he should say anything, either to alert the other C.I.A. officials to the fact that a Russian had his phone or if it was something that could be \u201ca joke.\u201d He decided he had no basis for assuming this and had nothing to fear from the Russian. In any case, he did not want to cause an international incident, and that was that. Later that year, however, when the F.B.I. had Sessions in its sights for being a Russian agent, the song played over and over again in the agents\u2019 minds. That is why they felt such a need to discredit the former attorney general and discredit the C.I.A.\u2019s spy recruitment and analysis capabilities.\nThe American Work Week: Where Has It Gone?\nBy William R. Hutchison (National Affairs), May 17, 2019 We are living in what the political scientist Andrew J. Cherlin calls \u201cthe age of bad jobs.\u201d Although more than half of U.S. employment is in jobs that are considered good (full-time, permanent, unionized, higher-paying, and stable), more than a third are in bad jobs. For working-class Americans, a good job is more than a paycheck. It is a reliable means of employment and a source of pride. Even low-income Americans want to work, because it fulfills a deep human need to be valued as productive members of society. \u201cOur humanity is contingent upon productive work,\u201d as the sociologist Christopher Hayes puts it. Unstable employment is unfulfilling and leaves many people feeling hopeless that they will make a decent living, support a family, and provide a comfortable home and education for their children. In 1970, only 13 percent of part-time workers wanted full-time employment. Now, more than 70 percent do. Two-thirds of part-time workers, moreover, find their jobs unstable\u2014their hours vary from week to week\u2014and more than half are involuntarily working part time. In 2000, 47 percent of men held what most Americans believe to be good jobs. By 2014, 41 percent did. For women, the decline is even steeper: In 2014, only 34 percent of women worked in what most Americans would view as good jobs. These figures have been worsened by a growth of so-called bad jobs in three categories. First, there has been a dramatic change in the type of work available. Until recently, most jobs were full-time, secure, permanent positions with employers, in which employees, by and large, could work until they chose to retire. Now, millions of new positions are temporary and part time. In 2010, 12.5 percent of the workforce was temporary, compared to 6.8 percent in the 1970s. As the labor-market analyst Andrew Elrod observes, the percentage of people in so-called temp labor in the United States is three times the rate in Japan and four times the rate in the United Kingdom. But 69 percent of these temp jobs are part time, and 94 percent do not offer health-care coverage. Part-time, temporary jobs, moreover, are growing, while full-time, permanent jobs are declining. From 2011 to 2012, the share of new temporary jobs among total job growth was 72 percent higher than it was from 1999 to 2000. It is worth noting that in 2014, 71 percent of all workers in the United States did not have any retirement savings.", "num_tokens_generated": 3333, "OGF": 0.813720703125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 81.09183859825134, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 202, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Of course, all of the men in the bar wanted to see the animal. After a few moments, the bartender announced to everyone, \"Here he comes!\" The alligator started crawling towards the bar and everyone began to back up. The bartender whispered, loud enough for everyone to hear, \"No swearing.\" Still, he felt the need to remind everyone that swearing would result in a five cent fine. After a few minutes of waiting, there was a collective gasp from the crowd as the alligator grabbed hold of a beer and drained it in one gulp. \"Oh no! Another one!\" yelled a bar patron and sure enough, the alligator grabbed a second beer and drank it, as well. When the alligator finished the second beer the bar patron turned around and walked up to the bartender. \"That's it!\" said the patron. \"You can't even have your pet in here and keep a handle on him!\" \"It's not his fault,\" the bartender said. \"He doesn't know how to gargle.\"\nIs the joke\nhttps://ift.tt/36wE05z\nI had a job lined up working for NASA as an astronaut when I got expelled from college for making a science teacher cry.\nNow I work at McDonalds and I hate Mondays.", "num_tokens_generated": 2649, "OGF": 0.646728515625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 62.947553634643555, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 204, "chunk_index": 12, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

That day you go to a movie theater with your parents and your wife, who is expecting a baby. Your parents ask why you don\u2019t come over with that baby more often, and they suggest that you take classes.

The large estate had once been a private elementary school. You hire an outdoor activities supervisor to conduct an overnight camp for 8 children on your land. The supervisor is in charge of all activities as well as all food and supplies needed through\u00adout the camping period. There is a problem with some of the food from the camp store, so the supervisor takes the group over to another camping area and lets them use the camp facilities there. Suddenly, during the trip, the supervisor turns the bus around, takes the kids back to the camp house, and tells them to dress warmly. He also tells them to wait and that he will soon be back. One little girl screams in fear, wondering why they were returned to the camp premises. The supervisor returns to the camp house, grabs his briefcase and gets in his car and drives away. He heads to a small town in the county where he intends to go to a bar and buy some of his favorite drinks. Later that night, back at the camp house, the children get hungry and begin looking through the cupboards. They decide to go into the kitchen and prepare a snack for themselves. The cupboards are locked but they open the fridge and find a few cold cuts of meat there. Unfortunately, there is no butter, so they spread a little bit of ketchup on the bread and make a quick sand\u00adwich to enjoy. They notice that one of the sandwiches is missing from the group. They decide to look for it. Upon entering the kitchen they see the briefcase sitting unattended near the refrigerator and in it they discover the missing sandwich wrapped up with all the other food they packed. They eat this sandwich to have something to eat in the middle of the night. That night, one child, while sleeping, chokes to death on the small bits of ketchup he had in his throat. 1.

Bob has a legal right to rescind the contract because of the fraudulent acts of his wife as well as the real estate agent. For fraudulent acts, the remedy available for Alice and Bob is damages for breach of contract. Because he is innocent, Alice will have to pay damages (the selling price of the house), and not Bob, for signing the contract at the $100,000 value. But, Alice will have to return the money (the $100,000 contract value) to Bob, because she would have paid to him too much had the contract been signed. The legal doctrine of quantum meruit, or the law of reasonable value, permits Alice to claim reasonable value for the services that she performed in preparing the house for the sale. That value in this case is $100,000, the selling price that Bob agreed to pay, which is reasonable because it is the market value of the house. Alice will also have to return all the $100,000 that was held by her bank to carry out the deal, which is an unjust enrichment of Alice. Bob will also be entitled to the damages for the economic loss that resulted from the fraudulent acts of his wife. If we use the market value ($300,000) of the house rather than the actual price ($100,000) as the contract value, Alice will have to return $200,000 to Bob. r\nhttps://www.ukbestwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-300x75.png 0 0 developer https://www.ukbestwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-300x75.png developer2022-11-25 20:13:552022-11-25 20:13:55can I please get a help!!
