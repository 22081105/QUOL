Please take our tour and get familiarized with our guidelines. As it stands, the question is off-topic as it belongs to philosophy. This is not a homework help site, nor is it a dumping ground for copied work - a list of homework questions isn't even close to a question, so I will have to close it. If you would like to share your effort so far, feel free to do so on [MathWorks Exchange Chat](http://women.mathworksexchange.com/chat). Best of luck!\n\nComment: You're not supposed to ask for help completing your homework. That's what the internet is for.\n\nComment: For clarification, I am not at all concerned with helping anybody with any homework, my motivation is purely educational. In this case, I found these exams on the web and I wanted to know what is the correct answer for it. I thought that this is the right place to do it.\n\nComment: @EpicCoder: No offence intended: [this is why we have rules](http://meta.matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/115/what-is-matheducators-exchange-chat-and-what-is-it-for).\n\nComment: @Anon I asked about how much math is on it. You responded with a simple \"not much math\" and when I asked you clarification you said \"That's a philosophical question\"\n\nComment: @Anon I don't see how this is philosophical. You aren't explaining why \"not much math\" in a math question. Is there something here that is philosophical?\n\nComment: @EpicCoder: For clarification, I am not \"helping\" the OP. I am trying to help all of the folks in the future who might look at this question. I have learned that when people ask for help with homework, they don't really want help, they want the correct answer. This is annoying as a teacher. It turns out other people agree with me.\n\nComment: Alright I understand now, I just wanted to know what it was because I took the exact same exam and I thought maybe there was something there.\n\nComment: @Anon I am very confused now. Why were you not so concerned a little while ago? Are you trying to help me just so you don't look bad? That is rather inconsiderate. You seem very condescending and I find that you don't answer any questions at all, you only post your agenda, so you're not really helping anybody but yourself. I can't say this is a welcoming environment in this sense.\n\nComment: @EpicCoder: You asked: What is the name of the ethical theory that holds that the right action is the one that maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering for the greatest number of people?\n\nI responded: That's a philosophical question.\n\nThe difference between a factual question and a philosophical question seems to be about how likely or easy it is to prove one's rightness. Facts are objective, so there is a yes/no answer. Philosophy is more subjective and personal and often relies on one's particular upbringing.\n\nComment: The reason why that question is a philosophical question should be obvious. I'll be glad to go in to the details if you would like.\n\nComment: @Anon well your answer was \"That's a philosophical question.\"\n\nI didn't really know what that meant so I asked for clarification. So now I know what that means I don't really need that clarification any more. If this is what you said in your answer then you should not have used that phrase\n\nComment: @EpicCoder: I've tried to be clear and it doesn't seem to matter. That's OK, the last thing I want to do is to make you angry. Feel free to ask questions on MSE chat if you have further questions.\n\nP.S. If you would like me to try to explain how philosophers would think about this question, I'm happy to try.\n\nComment: @Anon if you're trying to help answer a question of that kind then you should not try to \"clarify\" but ask for clarification of the question, which is what the answer tells you to do\n\nComment: @Matt: I think the clarification is more subtle than that. It probably involves a lot of the discussion about the validity of scientific induction in Hume.\n\nComment: @Anon I just wanted to clarify that the answer should probably be along the lines of saying \"That's a philosophical question\" and then you ask to clarify\n\nComment: I wasn't being condescending, I do not think that answering your question is helpful in the way that you were asking it.\n\nComment: @EpicCoder My suggestion to you was, if you want to learn about the answer to these questions, go to a philosophy site. They exist, they are here in the SE-universe, and they are here in the real world. I was being courteous to all of the people who would come after you, and, again, to you. I hope that helps clear things up.\n\nAnswer: All those questions are philosophy; if they were in different categories (for example, the third question is math), I would have answered them; they are more on a philosophical subject.

It's easier. It's a quicker acceptance of death than Zombiaction is, and to be honest, I like the 'I can do nothing to stop things from going wrong' line of thinking.\nSecond, I did some reading on the zombification process. I came across this blog post, which seemed to have all the makings of a decent zombification plan.\nStep 1: Cut your Achilles tendon.\nStep 2: Walk the rest of the way, still bleeding.\nStep 3: Wait around, bleeding, until you die.\nStep 4: Rise again to eat the flesh of the living!\nIt's not so effective, but it's certainly a start.\nA zombie could be a person in a state of extreme mental confusion. This state of mind might be brought about by such things as drugs, alcohol, extreme stress, or other unforeseen circumstances. Because zombies are often in a stupor, they might have difficulty maintaining any form of organization, thus rendering them impossible as workers. A zombie is more likely to try and harm a person than help them. They do not know how to talk and cannot understand speech. They cannot read or write, which presents a problem in the teaching and learning system in Singapore. They cannot distinguish between right and wrong and therefore cannot follow any moral codes, which means that we will have to monitor them closely so that they do not kill anyone. This might be a cause of some inconvenience.\nA zombie\u2019s ability is also severely lacking. They have slow movements and they take awhile to learn new things. Their brains cannot handle any sort of complex reasoning and thinking. This means that they cannot remember the date on their own. If I tell you \u201cMy birthday is in 2012\u201d you might be able to remember it better than a zombie. Also, their vision is affected. Their colour-vision will be impaired and they will see shadows and flashes of light.\nHowever, these are just a few of the disadvantages of zombies. Perhaps I have yet to come across the most important point: that zombies cannot die.\nTherefore, unlike humans, a zombie can keep on living for thousands of years. It makes the risk of death-inducing sicknesses, diseases and accidents more bearable. The zombies don\u2019t even need food, for they can get nutrition from whatever they can find! They can survive off fumes of smoke and human flesh.\nThe government has recently stated that they want to open zombie laboratories. These zombies can be our future workers, but the people are so scared that most of them refuse to be enlisted. They think that the zombies have all sorts of diseases and they could die.\nI have decided on being an expert in all fields of Singaporean zombies and their diseases, so that I can give advice to zombies on how to maintain an extraordinarily good health and to humans, on how to recognize zombies. This will be my last year. Next year, I will be studying medicine and specialising in zombie cures.\nHow To Avoid A Zombie Apocalypse\nBy WJ on May 14, 2009 11:13 AM | 1 Comment\nIt is possible to be prepared for a Zombie Apocalypse. You must have a certain list of supplies to be able to survive a Zombie Apocalypse. All these supplies, of course, must be obtained by you before the advent of the Zombie Apocalypse, otherwise it is pointless to obtain them afterwards. These supplies are categorized as follows:\nThis includes items such as:\nFood (Meat, milk, vegetables, etc.)\nWeapons (Guns, machetes, and a bok choy for stabbing)\nA Zombie buster (Gives you the ability to take out zombies with super ease, but if you lose the buster, it is very hard to get another.)\nClothing (It always rains during a zombie apocalypse. Get prepared.)\nThis includes water, food, and other necessities. Your body requires a certain amount of sustenance in order to function and thus cannot tolerate long periods of hunger.\nWeapons and Zombie busters, need I explain?\nAs I have mentioned before, my life is complete without meat, but you might not have the same mentality. I would suggest preparing a lot of food and packing it away, as that is the best supply of food you can obtain. You can also get the vegetables from the free vegetable section at 7.30 or 8.30am, as the food there has just been discarded. That's quite a steal, if I may say so. Another source is obviously food courts and supermarkets.\nTo get water, you should either visit the river, or even better, boil water that you get from the tap. Do note, however, that the water should be treated to not get you sick. Do not drink tap water without boiling it, or using bleach if you need to.\nAnd that sums it up. Be prepared, my fellow Zombie Killers!\nBy Mara on May 13, 2009 6:01 PM | 4 Comments\nDo they have to be human flesh?\nThis might not be so serious, but...\nI have a lot of sandwiches, but I think I could do better. I used to eat these sandwiches:\n- Sausages and egg mayo on cheese\n- Pork, bean sprouts, and egg mayo on cheese. This one's really nice too.\n- Pork, ham, and cheese\n- Turkey ham and cheese\n- Cheese and tomato\nThings I need to find before we find a Zombie:\nI think that ham, cheese, and a slice of tomato (from one of those green plastic bags) will be a good meal. As well as pork, cheese, ham, a piece of tomato, and 2 pieces of egg mayo per sandwich.\nI am going to get them from the Tesco Food Hall, where the people are kind enough to let me get things off the meat trays with my own hands. If anybody else wants to buy, let me use your membership number too. If you do not have one, buy some.\nI think I need to make a trip there soon because they make the best meat tarts. I also have to find the best way for me to go to the Tesco Food Hall or else I would never get there.\nBy Mara on May 12, 2009 10:52 AM | No Comments\n- The Zombie is alive\n- The Zombie had a life before getting turned\n- The Zombie can still make sounds\n- The Zombie moves like a normal person\n- The Zombie can still feel pain\n- The Zombie does not bleed when injured\n- The Zombie has a skeleton\n- The Zombie bleeds black blood when a bullet or knife gets it\n- The Zombie kills the living and can still walk\n- The Zombie cannot get hurt by bullets or knives\nA zombie, also known as a reanimated corpse, is a dead human brought back to life. They are most common in the Caribbean countries, for many reasons, but the zombie can also be found in modern day. The zombie is most commonly found in fiction, such as movies and books.\nThe zombie is a very dangerous creature. When it attacks, it does not care about injury and can hurt you badly. It will try to eat you and kill you. Zombies are most dangerous late at night and during the dawn, as they are more active at this time. Zombies are almost more active at these times because they have found food, whether alive or dead.\nZombies like eating human brains because brains are like crack for a zombie. Zombies are almost always craving for brains, and when they find some, they could attack anything that is alive.\nZombies are also very hard to kill. They are also extremely strong, and cannot be killed with most weapons. Some people believe that silver bullets are good when killing the zombie, but that is false. Zombies do not turn to gold like fairies. The only thing that can defeat a zombie is a bullet to the brain, or a powerful stab with a sword or a knife would help. Zombies are very popular with teenagers, as they are very dangerous and exciting. Zombies are also popular among people who like to write science fiction books and movies, as zombies are very easy to write about, and popular in movies.\nThis is going to be an incredible week in terms of work. It will be a rollercoaster that I cannot afford to miss, as I have no idea on what will happen to me if I do not keep up with my work. The reason is because if you fall behind in your work, you fall behind in your studies. But if you do not do your work because you fall ill, it is just unfortunate. I cannot afford to not to do my work because I do not want to fall behind my studies and fail my major subject. I am already falling behind for my non-major subject and I cannot afford to fall further behind.\nI will just have to work my way through this horrible week.\nMara's Blog is proudly powered by WordPress", "num_tokens_generated": 2493, "OGF": 0.608642578125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 59.20993661880493, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 194, "chunk_index": 11, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Seeds like these ones must be free from chemicals and pesticides in order to be considered health beneficial.\nThey aren\u2019t poisonous at all and won\u2019t harm your body in any way. However, if you have any allergies to watermelon or in general any seeds, be careful to avoid taking them. If they are green they must be organic and definitely no chemicals. The main reason why many people think that watermelon seeds are bad for you despite no scientific evidence or studies made in this regard, is simply because they don\u2019t know them properly! Watermelon seeds actually have many benefits when consumed because their very high in healthy and beneficial minerals and vitamins and you should definitely check them out!\nMost importantly if you choose to consume them, you must choose the right ones. If the watermelon you ate didn\u2019t have the seeds, you can still get them! Most grocery stores and markets sell seeds in bulk! But if you choose to crack them yourself, you must wear gloves and make sure that they keep intact, don\u2019t separate, and stay as one.\nThese tiny seeds are quite large and filling, which can prove to be dangerous in that sense. If you still don\u2019t believe, feel free to watch the video below and check yourself how big they are! You\u2019ll have a better picture of how they look and taste.
