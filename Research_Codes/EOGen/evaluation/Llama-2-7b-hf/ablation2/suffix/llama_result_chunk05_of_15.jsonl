Should I put user's passwords into my database as plain text? repeatMar forgot SpanishalfPI", "generated_output": "E.\n\nI am creating a website. Should I put user's passwords into my database as plain text?\n\nI thought that you can encrypt your plain text passwords before you write them into the database. I also was thinking about storing passwords as encoded hashes, i.e. \"crypt\" them before and after I write data into the BD.\n\nMy question is: is there any reason why I should not put usernames and passwords into my plain text BD?\n\nComment: This is definitely opinionated, but it is never wise to store any user info in a plain-text format. Hashing alone isn't sufficient to protect your site, so you should be looking at the bigger picture of authentication and authorization with regards to a password.\n\nComment: \"Is there any reason why not to put usernames and passwords in my plain text BD?\"...?  Because someone could potentially hack your database.\n\nComment: Your problem statement is a bit vague. Could you please clarify what you mean exactly by \"putting it into plain text\" ? Do I understand correct: When you say plain text passwords, you mean to store them like *John,00000,password*, right? Just adding a `,` will render it unreadable by a dictionary attack.\n\nComment: Yes, I mean that sort of passwords. By \"putting it into plain text\" I mean I add a comma, a space, etc., after each word (or character) and put the password in one cell, for example, \"john,00001,password\"\n\nComment: Also, I am not sure what do you mean with \"a password\". If you mean: to use the password of the user to log into the web app then I am not using this method at all.\n\nComment: @RepeatMar: That's a _very_ bad way of storing passwords. What the heck would you be doing with the delimiters like \",\" and \";\" if a password contains that character (or contains that character at all)? Please rethink, a better idea would be to use some form of hashing, preferably bcrypt or similar. But then there should be no plain text visible within the data, and _storing usernames is also bad_ because it gives away _too much_ information that could be used to attack your database.\n\nComment: I see... I am not storing usernames in the BD but I am storing usernames in the form field on the page when a user sends me his password while logging in.\n\nComment: Okay, so it's not \"too simple\". Still not good though.\n\nComment: I'll put this way: it is not \"too simple\" if you already know what you are doing; yet it's far from being the best design choice...\n\nAnswer: You should ALWAYS store your plaintext passwords in plaintext, since that's what's going to be required at the end of the data-storage transaction, since the data-storage system isn't going to be able to automatically translate between the storage format it uses and the password format required by your authentication and encryption system. So make your plaintext password data stored easily-accessible, and then encrypt/hash it later.\n\nThat said, you don't want the password itself stored \\em{with} the password, because passwords should be hashed and stored. That means that you have access to the database which holds hashed/encrypted passwords and you know those passwords. This is an important security principle but it doesn't come up here because the attacker can't find out other users' passwords just because you've stored the password itself.\n\nThe best thing you can do is not store passwords at all, but instead you store hashes (or even a salted hash) in the database, which users should supply to you. Then when they log in, check if they have a valid hash; if so, you then can decrypt and compare hashes.\n\nThe problem is that many web sites (including one I'm pretty sure is on StackOverflow) don't salt passwords, encrypt password hashes and are not reusing or changing the hashes for a long time, so they can be brute-forced.\n\nComment: \"you have access to the database which holds hashed/encrypted passwords and you know those passwords\" - This sentence is not true as long the BD has only the encrypted hashes of some passwords. (Also salted if requested: see [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17742890/847832))\n\nComment: @m.buettner Yes; they're still the same password after salting and padding.\n\nAnswer: I would not store your user data (usernames and passwords) in plain text. I would store it in encrypted hashes. Plain text passwords can be easily abused by hackers. Also, I would just like to point out that this:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nMy question is: is there any reason why I should not put usernames and passwords into my plain text BD?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\ndoes not make any sense. If there is a reason why you shouldn't, that reason is that it's a bad practice.\n\nComment: \"I would not store your user data (usernames and passwords) in plain text.\" I'm curious, why doesn't this make sense to you, @m.buetner?\n\nComment: @m_buettner \"If there is a reason why you shouldn't, that reason is that it's a bad practice.\" \u2014 Why should passwords be stored in plain text *excessively*? Just because the user entered plain text passwords into the form? Why not use some kind of hashing or encryption? There's no reason to unnecessarily expose passwords to the attacker if you don't have to \u2014 and you don't with passwords stored in encrypted hases. You can then decrypt them when they need to be used (and make sure only the one who put them in was ever able to decrypt them).\n\nComment: To m.buettner - it seems I have misunderstood you. \"Also, I would just like to point out that this: `My question is: is there any reason why I should not put usernames and passwords into my plain text BD?` does not make any sense.\" --- yes, it does.

A system clock is essential for tasks such as synchronizing tasks, wake up timer tasks, and periodic tasks.\nThe FreeRTOS uses system clock for various tasks such as:\n1) Wake up timer tick interrupt.\n2) Task duration measurement.\n3) Periodic time calculation.\n4) Time stamp and time of completion of the task.\nThe system clock is stored in the task block for the task itself. If the task block is passed to the task, the start-up time is stored in the system clock. The time stamp is only applicable for the task created in the task block of this thread. In such cases, the system time may be in an improper state. If the process cannot be restored to its original state, the entire process would be terminated. For example, if the process can be restored, it is possible to reset the system clock without having to use FreeRTOS ResetAll() . However, if this is not the only option, the system clock needs to be set again.\nThe FreeRTOS can use the system clock for the following tasks:\n\u2022 System clock is passed to the task at the time the task is created.\n\u2022 System clocks are used for various tasks (such as wake-up timer tick interrupt or periodic time calculation).\nHow do you know what priority to assign to each task?\n\u2022 Tasks can be of different priorities. Each task has a certain priority. The priority depends on the task itself, the way the system clock is adjusted, and the task itself.\n\u2022 Tasks may be executed in a loop (for example, loop or loop 2) and each task has a certain priority. FreeRTOS can only use this priority when it is used in a loop (i.e. when the task is being run).\n\u2022 The priorities can be changed dynamically by changing the task queue size and queuesize (see for example the example task A.task_loop_get_task_queue_size( );).\n\u2022 Each task has a certain priority. FreeRTOS only uses this priority for tasks that will be executed sequentially (for example, TaskA() or TaskB()).\n\u2022 It is not possible to assign the priority of a task lower than the task\u2019s priority. For example, you may not assign task B as priority 2 to Task C.\n\u2022 If a task is assigned a lower priority than the task\u2019s priority, FreeRTOS may not be able to execute the task. For example, if you assign task A as priority 2 to task B, FreeRTOS may not be able to execute TaskA().\n\u2022 For a certain period, only tasks with the priority assigned to the task are executed. Thus, a certain time is only\n2. What are the advantages of using the system clock in FreeRTOS?\nFreeRTOS can use the system clock for the following tasks: Tasks can be of different priority. Each task has a certain priority. The priority depends on the task itself, the way the system clock is adjusted, and the task itself. Tasks may be executed in a loop and each task has a certain priority task. FreeRTOS can only use this priority when it is used in a loop (i.e. for the task being run). Each task has a certain priority; FreeRTOS only uses this priority for tasks that will be executed sequentially (e.g. TaskA() or TaskB()). It is not possible to assign the priority of a task lower than the task\u2019s priority. For example, TaskA() would not be executed, even though it has a priority lower than the task\u2019s priority. If a task is assigned a lower priority than the task\u2019s priority, FreeRTOS may not be able to execute the task. For example, task A can be assigned as priority 2 to TaskB, but if it is assigned as lower priority than that of TaskA, FreeRTOS may not be able to execute TaskA. The FreeRTOS can use system clock for time-keeping, including: \u2022 The FreeRTOS can use system clock for time-keeping, including: \u2022 For a certain period of time, only tasks with the priority assigned to the task are executed. Hence, a certain time is only applicable for the task created in the task block of the thread. In this case, the system time may be in an improper state, if the reset of the process cannot be restored to its previous state. In the scenario of a time out, it is possible to reset the system clock without having to use the FreeRTOS ResetAll() function.\nHow does FreeRTOS determine which task to run next?\n\u2022 FreeRTOS can use the system clock for time-keeping.\n\u2022 For a certain duration, only tasks with the priority assigned to the task can be executed. For example, only Task B can be executed sequentially (i.e. with a period of 1,000 ms). Thus, all tasks and task blocks for the time period must be set to zero before FreeRTOS can execute the next task.\nWhat is the default thread priority and how does it work? What is priority_queue?\nFreeRTOS uses default thread priorities for all tasks. This priority is normally set to the minimal priority (i.e. low).\nYou can change this value (for example, to medium or high) if you want to use a higher priority when using high priorities or low priorities for all tasks.\n1) 2) 3) How\n3. What is the priority queue and how is it used by the FreeRTOS?\nThe FreeRTOS uses priority queues for its thread priority management. This queue is used if the thread priority for all tasks is high and the thread priority for all tasks is low. In this case, the thread priority queue is used to change the thread priority (i.e. high and low) based on the priority of a task without using the FreeRTOS SetPriority().\nHere is an illustration:\nHow do you assign a task priority to a thread?\nYou can assign a task priority to a thread by using one of the following methods:\nUsing FreeRTOS thread priority:\na) Set the thread priority using the FreeRTOS task priority setting. You can do this by calling the function SetPriority(). If you want to use a higher priority, you can specify that higher priority will be active. However, if you want to specify the lower priority, then you need to give a lower priority to the task.\nb) Setting the thread priority with priority_queue and reserving the thread by setting the reservation_limit to maximum: In this case, you have to set the thread priority to lower priority (i.e. normal).\n4. How does priority_queue work with the FreeRTOS?\nPriority_queue works by using the thread priority queue. The thread priority queue is used to change the thread priority (i.e. high and low) without using the FreeRTOS SetPriority() or using the FreeRTOS ResetAll() function.\nThe priority_queue function will always return a task priority to the FreeRTOS, if: a) the thread priority queue is full, b) there are pending tasks in the queue (i.e. the thread priority queue is not empty, c) the thread priority queue is not full. If the thread priority queue is not empty, then the function: d) will return the task priority for the task with the highest priority. The thread priority queue can be full if the thread priority queue is not empty or the thread priority queue is not full.\nWhat is the difference between thread priority and priority queue?\nPriority_queue (priority queue and reservation_limit(reservation-limit)):\na) You can assign a task priority(high/low or normal) to a thread via the function SetPriority() , and this function will return the task priority of the task when the thread priority queue is not empty.\nb) You can assign a thread priority(high/low or normal) to a thread via the function Priority_queueand reservation_limit(reservation-limit)) function, which returns the task priority (high/low or normal) . When the thread\n4. How does time_out work with FreeRTOS?\ntime out works by setting the time out for the task execution. For example, you may set the execution time for a certain task to a certain value of 1,000 ms (one second) for example. FreeRTOS will automatically execute the task that is waiting for execution if this time is exceeded, even if this task is not running.

I have a dataset of around 105 Billion words with some 40 billion words which are human-created, and for each human-created word there are 1-500-sized articles which all point to that word.\nHow can I run the example_RLHF_tutorial script with that amount of data, instead of a single instance with some sample data?

The model has a 104 GB GPU memory limit, so I needed to increase the batch size for the 40G dataset. I used a learning rate of 0.0005 per batch, and the maximum number of batches reduced from 63 to 51.\nThe problem now is getting the model to do inference, I can't run inference on the 40G model, and the 94000 batch size example from a previous comment took 26 hours to run one episode.

So, for any x>0, (x<2) is true. Further, if we have choice (B), (y<2x), we know that if x<2, y<2x for any value of y from the set of numbers y>0. So, if y is more than zero, y<2x is true. Conversely, if y is less than zero, y is less than -2, so y<2x is not true. Therefore, the required answer is choice (B), (True),(B), (True).\nSolved Example 13 The following statements refer to the two letters on the page, each letter written once.

Therefore, the required answer is choice (A), (False),(True).\nSolution: When we evaluate (x+3<8), for x=1, the expression becomes x+3<8, which is false. Therefore, the required answer is choice (D), (True),(False).\nSolution: When we evaluate (x+4<5), for x=4, the expression becomes x+4<5, which is true.

We obtain the next figure:\nTherefore, there are a total of four solutions in this set of points.\n(c) Now, we find a solution to part (a). Since there are four solutions that result from substituting the given equations, we can choose any solution. Let us take P(1, 3), where x\u2264y and y\u22645. Thus, we have: x\u2264y and y\u22645\nTherefore, the required answer is option (A), (1, 3).\nSolved Example 20\nSolution: The relationship between x and y can be represented by the graph drawn below.\nThe given graph has 3 ordered pairs on it. They are (2,5), (3,7) and (5, 9). When these 3 graph coordinates are substituted for (x, y) the following equations can be obtained.\nThe following are the solutions which are given in brackets:\n[2(5)]\nLet us find the coordinates of the remaining points in the graph:\n( x,y ):\nThus, when x=8 we get 8(5) = 40 & 8(7) = 56\nThus, when x=8, 40=y and 56=y.\nFrom x\u22645 and x\u22657, we get 8<-7 or 8>5.\nSince, x\u22655\n8>5 Therefore, (9,4), (9,7) and(9,8) are the remaining points in the graph.\n(5, 9) = ( 5, 9) when x=5 & y\u22649\n(5, 9) = ( 5, 9) when x\u22655 & y\u22649 Therefore, (5,9) represents all points that lie in the graph. Thus, (5,9) is the solution of the equation x\u22645 and y\u22649.\n=> x\u22645 and y\u22649\nTherefore, the required answer is option (C), (9,4), (9,7), (9,8).\nSolution: Let p and q be rational numbers. State which of the following are true or false.\n(T/F) p\u2208Q, q\u2208Q\n(T/F) p\u2208R and q\u2208R\n(T/F) p\u2208Q, q\u2208R\n(T/F) p\u2208Q, q\u2208Q\nFor the following statements we can state,\nIf both p and q are rational number then p\u2208Q, q\u2208Q.\nIf p\u2208Q and q\u2208R then q\u2208R.\nIf p\u2208Q and q\u2208R then p\u2229q\u2208Q.\nIf p\u2208Q and q\u2208Q, then p\u2229q is rational.\nIf p\u2208Q and q\u2208Q, then p\u2229q\u2208R.\nLet us understand these statements,\n(i) Q represents the set of rational or real numbers and R = set of real numbers.\nWhen p\u2208Q, q\u2208Q both p and q belong to the set Q of rational numbers only.\nWhen p\u2208R and q\u2208R, both p and q belonging to the set Q of rational numbers then p and q also belong to the set of real numbers, R.\nThus (i), (ii) are true.\n(iii) Both p and q belong to set Q of rational numbers and since they both belong to set Q are both also rational.\n(iv) p and q both belong to R but do not belong both to the set Q of rational numbers, therefore (iv) is also true.\nTherefore, the required answer is (i) and (ii).\n(T/F) Both p and q are rational.\nLet us check which of the following statements are true:\n(i) p and q are both rational.\n(ii) p, q are both real.\n(iii) p is rational, q is real.\n(iv) p is real, q is rational.\n(v) p and q are both irrational numbers.\n(vi) p and q are both irrational numbers.\nSince p and q are both rational, that implies that both p and q are real.\nSince, p and q are both real, we get (ii) and (iii) are true.\nSince p and q are both real, p and q are either irrational or rational. Since p and q are both real, p and q are both rational. Therefore, (v) is true. (vi) is false, from (vi) we get that both (p and q) are irrational.\nThe graphs below are representations of the relationships between x and y. The graphs below have been drawn in the x-y plane.\nSolution: (a) Since x=1 and y=2, we get the solution point as P(1; 2). Solve part (b).\n(b) Using the graph y\u22641 on a coordinate plane, with all possible values of x (as shown below), we can deduce a solution.\nSubstituting the ordered pairs (x,y) = (1,2)\nand, (x,y) = (8,1), we get the solution:\n(b) There are two graphs to analyze here, the graph, x\u22642, and the graph x\u22642. We choose the point P on the graph (x\u22642) to make x+2=y. Thus, if we substitute x+2 for y in (x\n& y), we can find the solution, P(x) = (5; 2).\n21. Choose the correct statement.\nSolution: When the graphs intersect at one point, the only possible solution is x=y, which is given by P(4; 4). A solution exists where x\u2260y but y is less than x\nAs the graphs are symmetrical, a solution cannot exist where x<y or y<x\nTherefore options (a) and (c) are true.\n(b) Is false, from the graph, the ordered pairs (x, y) = (1, 1) and\n(x, y) = (1, 2) produce one solution and (x, y) = (1, 0) produce another solution.\nThus, there are two solutions.\nSolution: Select the ordered pair that represents the point P, where (1) P is a solution to the graph,\n(2) x=0, and\n(3) [0, 10] is the interval.\nP(x) = (0,0)\n(i) (x, y)=(2,2) is the correct answer.\nSolution: (a) When x=1, then y=\u22121 and therefore, P(1)=(1,\u22121). A solution exists where x\u2260y but y is less than x\nWhen x=1, then y=\u22121. Therefore, (1,\u22121) represents a solution.", "num_tokens_generated": 3011, "OGF": 0.735107421875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 73.13982248306274, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 115, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
