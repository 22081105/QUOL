The sum of the numbers on the adjacent pieces must equal 5. This means that the solution to the puzzle requires arranging the pieces in a specific order so that the numbers on the adjacent pieces add up to 5.\nStep 2: Reasoning\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the different ways in which we can arrange the pieces in a sequence that add up to 5. One way to solve this puzzle is to arrange them so that the sum of the adjacent numbers is 5. For example, we could put the square first, then the triangle, and finally the circle and star so that the sum of the adjacent numbers is 1+2+3+4=5+5=10. This sequence results in 9 different solutions.\nAnother way to solve this puzzle is to arrange the pieces so that the sum of the adjacent numbers is 4. For instance, we could put the star first, followed by the triangle, circle and square since the sum of this sequence would be 1+2+3+4=10+1+2+3=16. This method would result in 8 different solutions.\nOverall, there are 9 different ways to solve this puzzle. As we've seen, one possible solution is to arrange the pieces so that the sum of the adjacent numbers is 5. This solution has 9 different arrangements. Another solution is to arrange the pieces so that the sum of the adjacent numbers is 4. This solution has 8 different arrangements. 365753052391 102000967143", "num_tokens_generated": 453, "OGF": 0.110595703125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 10.182994365692139, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 122, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

FilterMar forgotTu BothPI", "generated_output": "II forgotU. Let's look at an example. One way is by combining GROUP BY with a subqueries. So this is where we\u2019re trying to make an SQL statement like \u201chow do we pick out the last ID for every single group?\u201d If you\u2019re familiar with MySQL at all, you know you could write a query like this. Last Row Query. So I am using a query to find the record which is most recently inserted. Aggregates have two key components: 1. This function takes a table, and a list of columns to limit the rows to. (You're not that important.) How can I solve the problems of group by and order in SQL (MySQL)? SQL: 2105 QUERY SPECIFIC GROUP ID LIST. For example, imagine you\u2019re doing the following: When that last value is a NULL, MySQL doesn\u2019t include that in the result set. 1. And because of this, we can say that we want group-by-agregate and select-from-last-row. Let\u2019s start with some test data. A subquery also is known as a correlated subquery. In MySQL version 5.5, you can use the ROW_NUMBER() function to list the rows ordered by ID. Here we\u2019ll get a list of all the top 10 groups, each containing the ID of the employee with the largest balance. The GROUP BY feature is one of the basic features in SQL. The key component here is that the WHERE part of the query is inside a subquery: I would suggest using the \"last insert id\" sql command which is as follows : This is known as Correlated Subqueries. This is why you get something that looks like this: If you\u2019re not familiar with correlated subqueries, consider this your mandatory lesson before you move on. The above SQL query will return all employees who have a balance greater than 1000. Let\u2019s see what happens to the query above with the GROUP BY inside the subquery: It looks almost exactly the same as it did above. When the SQL query is applied over the table we get only one record. First, SQL returns a result set containing one row. (This happens all the time in MySQL). Here, we will use the same GROUP BY that we first used and that gave back the wrong result. Here comes group-by feature of mysql, it helps to group data or records into different groups depending on a common condition. Now, the problem that remains is how to determine which of the employees is in the first group. It shows that the employee with id 4205 has a balance of 250000. To summarize, GROUP BY clause groups data into separate output rows based on one or more columns specified in the GROUP BY clause. To create a new id, MySQL assigns to it a random value that is unique \u2013 but never null. What is the point of using an ORDER BY on a GROUP BY? A correlated subquery is a subquery that references a column in a table that is referenced in the main query. We group all the employees by having an employee balance of less than 1000. But, the thing is that we have a problem here; the query will be applied for every record. SQL GROUP BY 3. When using aggregates, use GROUP BY. I am using a MySQL query. It is an important function which is used to get the last inserted id. It uses the output of one query in another. Let\u2019s use this and see how it would work with the subquery: It works perfectly. This means if you are creating a \u2026 SQL Server 2014 supports two methods of extracting a single row's value from a table, including columns, by ranking each row in a table based on a group by operator.

You were very helpful\n\nComment: I didn't find any references in the answer to why sorting with clang++ vs GCC would give such a difference.\n\nComment: @Michael It was just to save time in figuring out why it was slower than clang (it was a C-only program with sorting code to prove something). I guess it wasn't clang that was making it faster, but just the compiler used.\n\nComment: In general, I expect clang to be slightly faster than GCC. There is also the fact that GCC 11 will, by default, compile much faster than GCC 10. This is probably the reason.\n\nComment: @PaulTomblin I am more surprised than ever. I was convinced it was just noise, but if you say it is probably GCC version, then I am not surprised. GCC's performance has been changing wildly, while clang is kind of stable on performance.\n\nComment: @YSC I ran your program with clang++10 and clang++11 just to compare. I didn't make any adjustments. clang++10 took 0.549505, while clang++11 only took 0.537978.\n\nComment: @Michael Yes, it was indeed just noise. I haven't compiled my C++98 code in a long time and was thinking about it. As it turned out, this is not something to worry about, because clang, surprisingly enough (for me), it is much faster, on average, than GCC.\n\nComment: @YSC My compiler's performance with clang++11 is not that different, either, compared with the clang++10.\n\nAnswer: Sorting with large arrays of small values often (often, but not always) gets much faster with more recent CPU's. Sorting with large arrays of small values generally is done by using a sort with a radix sort and it is radix sort that is using more recent CPU's better. The algorithm in the question is not using a radix sort. One possible reason for the difference is here a [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity12/sec12-paper-chen.pdf) in which the performance of sorts with large arrays of small values is compared for different types of CPU's.\n\nComment: It was not the reason though because `std::sort`, which has a radix sort, was also much slower on Ryzen than on my older Core i7-2670.\n\nAnswer: Just trying different tools is a simple, cheap method of comparing performance. Do it for fun and to avoid wasting time on the wrong tool. Be sure to try a bunch of different tools; you can never be sure there isn't a better tool for this or that job.\n\nWhen you can run multiple tools for the same job, it is good to be able to use other people's work, to compare the relative performance. In software-engineering, that's what benchmarks are, so that is what we should be using here, too.\n\nI often get asked about compiling and executing a benchmark of mine. I am actually somewhat afraid to do that and to share it, because I am terrified of being wrong. So, I'm not sure that's a good idea. The better idea is to find someone else's benchmark, test your tool, and let us know the results. I know I won't do that, but I'm working on ways to make it possible for other people to do that.\n\nThe most important difference is the compiler and toolchain.\n\nSome important differences are the use of threads and the use of SIMD.\n\nThough the author hasn't said it, the compiler and toolchain probably matter, and that is what I'll comment on.\n\nThe Intel compiler (aka ICC) sometimes performs much better than GCC and Clang. GCC performs better than Clang, sometimes, on IA32 and newer architectures, sometimes. I hope you don't mind that I am not mentioning GCC in particular.\n\nSoftware benchmarks are useful, but they must be treated with great care.\n\nComment: @Michael: Thank you for the edit. :-) The problem comes when you don't know where to get performance information. Some companies have publicly accessible benchmarks, and some don't. When someone has the information, they may be working for a company that is reluctant to share it with a competitor. I've tried to create public benchmarks in the past, and I've had some good success, but I don't know how I can do better at that in the future.\n\nComment: @Michael: A lot of people try to create public benchmarks, and it is funny how it fails again and again. I am so used to having access to performance information (even sensitive performance information that may be harmful, if released), that I've learned to ask companies to share performance with me. I'm a real pest sometimes, but it does work. I recently learned that the GCC team is not sharing its performance information with me, and I am working on a compromise. I'll keep you updated.\n\nAnswer: I haven't actually tried this on modern CPUs, but this was the conclusion I came to when I read this question a few years ago:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nstd::sort is not always faster, and when it does compile time outweighs execution time.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: Did you try it on modern CPUs?", "num_tokens_generated": 1329, "OGF": 0.324462890625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 30.96249532699585, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 130, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

A dataframe is just a normal list in Excel and you can do whatever you want like sort, index etc. Just paste the results into a new window and use \"Paste Special\" --> \"Text to Columns\" --> \"Delimit by\" as something like a comma character.\n\nComment: Can I print all the contents to a separate excel file with this? I guess not?\n\nComment: You can certainly do so. You will just need to read the output from the terminal to have the data in your local system and then save it on your local system and use it for whatever you like to do in Excel. Note that the method I mentioned above doesn't work for every combination of character delimiters.\n\nComment: Thanks for that. So is there an easier method to get it into Excel?\n\nComment: You can use `pd.read_clipboard` and specify the line endings as \"text\" to read from the clipboard. You can then save the resulting dataframe as xlsx or xlsm. You can use any of the methods described for reading the text into pandas dataframes.\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/201602/discussion-between-j-carlo-diaz-and-arun-shanbhag).\n\nAnswer: In general, if you have a list of lists (or tuples, etc.) they can be turned into a pandas DataFrame pretty easily.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to make a DataFrame called df with the output from your `table` variable, here's what I would do:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Note: you can probably import the other modules you needed in the first 3 lines\n\n# Assuming the table variable contains the output you mentioned\ncols = [\"D\",\"E\",\"A\",\"B\",\"G\",\"C\",\"F\"]\ncells = [table[i][j] for i, j in zip(range(2,len(table)), cols)]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(cells, index=[j for j, _ in cols], columns=cols)\n\nprint(df)\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will create a df object that has an index that starts at 2 and an x column that contains the values D, E, A, B, G, C, F\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n\\begin{code}\n    D   E   A   B   G   C   F\n2   E    C   I   Q   Z   H   L\n4   Q   L   S   R   Z   S   N\n\\end{code}\n\nHere is the [docs for DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) and the [docs for building up a dataframe with lists and tuples](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_sequence.html).", "num_tokens_generated": 828, "OGF": 0.2021484375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 18.908561944961548, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 131, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
