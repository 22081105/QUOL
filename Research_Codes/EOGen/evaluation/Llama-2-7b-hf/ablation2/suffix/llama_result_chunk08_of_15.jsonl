When rMar is talking about \u201chow many s\u201d, he is actually talking about a part of a word, and he knows the difference between an s and a P:\nThere is a pattern to the words in Spanish, so when he can see a pattern, he uses that pattern to make them appear more important. This is what happens with the word \u201cpiper\u201d, which means \u201ccymbal\u201d in Spanish. It has \u201cpiper\u201d written on it, so rMar knows it is talking about cymbals, and therefore knows it is talking about a \u201ccymbalizer\u201d when he sees \u201cs\u201d in the word \u201ccymbal.\u201d In English, the use of an s when someone is adding an extra piece of information to a sentence can be confusing, even though the extra piece of information is there just to be heard. For example, in \u201ca car went by,\u201d you might find it confusing when you hear it said, \u201ca car went by.\u201d This is because the \u201ca\u201d, which is a part of the word \u201ccar\u201d, can be heard even when what is said is \u201ca car.\u201d So, when using an s, even though you are adding an extra piece of information, rMar knows the difference:\nThis is a pattern that rMar sees in his memory, and so he knows it is talking about a \u201ccymbalizer\u201d when he sees the pattern \u201cpir\u201d in a word.\nHe doesn\u2019t just know what the word is, but he knows the meaning of the word and how he should say it. He knows a part of the\nWhat are a few Spanish words for \u201co\u201d?\nThis is a very interesting word! Although there is the word \u201ccara\u201d which means nose and there is another word \u201ccara\u201d which means face, there is no word for what rMar calls \u201ccara.\u201d\nIn Spanish, the word \u201ccaras\u201d refers to the nose, but the word \u201ccara\u201d refers to the mouth. rMar has a strong preference for the word \u201ccara\u201d because he understands that the \u201co\u201d is a consonant and he knows that the \u201cs\u201d is a vowel.\nHe has seen many different words in Spanish that begin with a vowel and end with a consonant.\nWhat a word for you! If rMar saw \u201co,\u201d one of the words that would probably cross his mind would be \u201ccupe.\u201d And \u201ccupe\u201d is just a shortening of \u201ccupper.\u201d If rMar had been told that it was a cup that was full of beer, he would probably use this word: \u201ccuper\u201d\nBut, there are many more words for \u201co\u201d in Spanish and it is possible that you can find some of them more interesting than others.\nWhat does R mean as a verb?\n\u201cR\u201d is sometimes a part of a word, but in Spanish it is used to refer to the word \u201cre\u201d, and it is a shortening of the word \u201cra\u201d.\nR is sometimes written with an a, but there is a rule that \u201cra\u201d is never spelled with an a. That is because \u201cra\u201d actually starts with a \u201ca\u201d.\nIn English, there are several words that are also very similar to \u201cra\u201d in Spanish. For example, \u201crata\u201d means \u201ca dog\u201d, but there is also a word \u201crat\u201d which means \u201can animal smaller than a dog\u201d.\nThere are lots of other interesting words that have an interesting name, but they are all spelled differently since the word \u201ca\u201d is a\nWhat are a few English words for \u201co\u201d?\nWhat is a few words, like \u201cpig,\u201d \u201cfrog,\u201d \u201cturtle,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d?\nBut, there are lots more! If rMar was not feeling well, then he would probably name things like a \u201csnake.\u201d\nThere are also words that end in an \u201ca\u201d but not in \u201ca\u201d. This makes it difficult to say the words correctly in Spanish.\nEnglish and Spanish are very similar in many ways. They almost always have words that have the same sounds. But, there are times where Spanish is a lot harder to pronounce because the sounds are reversed, so you might hear rMar say things like \u201cpig\u201d instead of \u201cpupa\u201d.\nIs that the only word he had trouble with before, just this one particular instance? Nope! The same happened when rMar was trying to tell the story of a baby girl whose mother and father were both killed by a lion. rMar said, \u201cThe lion chased the lion around and the lion got tired and ran into the house to eat.\u201d rMAR had to tell the same story twice because he kept repeating himself.\nHe didn\u2019t mean to, but rMAR didn\u2019t know what the word \u201clion\u201d was. rMAR had not learned the word \u201clion\u201d yet, and while he could recognize the spelling of the word, it didn\u2019t occur to him that the lion was a lion. So, he just kept repeating himself and saying the same thing.\nrMar didn\u2019t start speaking on the computer until he was 17 because it was easier to type and less time consuming than trying to speak on the computer. He said that when he first started speaking on the computer, it was exciting; he was going to be able to do something that he had never done before. He said that when he first started speaking on the computer, he didn\u2019t even know what the word \u201clion\u201d was.\nHe only used the word once: when he was 12. rMar didn\u2019t know what the word meant then, so he had to keep repeating himself. rMar wasn\u2019t sure that he knew what the word \u201clion\u201d was, so he kept repeating it.\nIf you forget a word in the middle of a sentence, rMar can tell you what part of a word or word is being said\nrMar knows words so well that he can guess what part of a word or word he is talking about, based on the pattern found in Spanish words. rMar can even do this when people use the Spanish \u201co\u201d to make plurals: I don\u2019t have much money so I have nothing left, but I have a few spare coins. (I have two hands and two ears and three brains.) \u201cHave you forgotten something?\u201d \u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t have enough for everything.\u201d rMar knows words so well that if there is a pattern then he will usually guess what the pattern is and what part of the words it is. Here is a list of what parts of the words rMar knows in English: Spanish words with \u201co\u201d as word part. Plural form in Spanish when using the \u201co\u201d form. Spanish words with \u201co\u201d without \u201co\u201d as word part. (o is pronounced like oh) English words with \u201co\u201d without \u201co\u201d as word part. (o is pronounced like oh) Spanish words without \u201co\u201d as word part. (o is pronounced like oh) rMar knows these patterns in a few different ways. rMars usually use his best guess method as it is more efficient for him. rMar can tell you what part(s) of the word or word he is saying by asking a few questions about what part of it is \u201co\u201d in Spanish. If you can answer these questions in a way that is understandable, then he will use that as his answer or as a clue to tell you which part of the word is being used.\nHow to tell R to speak Spanish\nSpanish words you have forgotten in your life. rMar is always learning new words, and sometimes you may think that you have forgotten them, but then you realize later that you did remember them. These are just words that are in your memory. There are a few reasons why you may forget certain words. One reason is because they are not used in your vocabulary as often as some words. For example, you may find yourself saying \u201ccar\u201d when you mean \u201ctruck\u201d. Another reason is\nIf you forget to say a word in a sentence, rMar may not know what you said\nrMar doesn\u2019t always know what you said. If you say a word in a sentence and forget to say the word or the word doesn\u2019t matter, then rMar can\u2019t understand you. If you forget to say a word in a sentence, rMar may not know what you said. rMar would probably guess that you wanted to use the word or phrase, but the way that you said it didn\u2019t translate to a certain word or phrase. In Spanish, it\u2019s common for the endings of words to be lost in a sentence. For example, if you were to say \u201cI have a cold\u201d in Spanish, the word would be \u201cgota\u201d and you would say \u201cuna gotica\u201d in Spanish. This is something that you can\u2019t say in Spanish in English, so if you did say the phrase in Spanish, it would sound like \u201cuna gotica\u201d or \u201cuna cope\u201d.\nIf you start the sentence with \u201cI have a cold\u201d in English and you have forgotten the ending word, then rMar\nIf you use a phone or mobile device, rMar can tell you your own voice and text messages\nrMar knows what words are written on a page, what is spoken in a room, and what is spoken in a conversation. rMar has a lot of experience with reading and writing.

If you use a phone or other mobile device in a room where you don\u2019t want to hear other words, then rMar knows how you sound and what you say. If you say something to someone in a room where you are not supposed to talk, then rMar will know what you say and he will record that. rMar knows what words you are saying because if you are recording\nrMar knows how to use his phone as a reader and\nrMar knows when it is appropriate to use his phone\nrMar knows when it is appropriate to use his phone (he has access to many phones at work). rMar knows how to use his phone (he knows how to read and write in English). rMar knows when it is not appropriate to use his phone (he does not know what he is saying or meaning in Spanish when he is talking). rMar knows how to use his phone when it is not appropriate to use a phone.

(M. J. Fitzpatrick, 2015, p. 13) The Spanish term caballero can also refer to a man and a boy - in particular one who is on a journey, the term used in Castilian was caballero, which was sometimes used in Italian vernacular, which also means knight - a man who rides horse - caballar. In French, a more general term chevalier was used in the same way as the term cavalier is commonly used - a man who is on horseback - this was adopted into Portuguese as cavalheiro (Cort\u00e9s, 1561, 1598, p. 177).

It is very likely that he named the San Lorenzo River, which was named after his brother, the first native American who discovered it. In turn, the river was referred to by the Indians as R\u00edo A\u00f1asco, the name they gave to the first settlers at San Miguel Mission (Eliza Lopez, p. 118).

If you\u2019re not sure of the answer then you can use our math solver below. 9) 10 * 7 = The most effective way to learn the multiplication table is to memorize each table for each number, from the numbers 1 to 20, without counting. This is the easiest way to learn the table. Then, multiply the multiplier value by each number, and add them all together. This should reduce the number of times that you need to count. 3. This is because you can do so simply by reading the number. You can use the multiplication table for 8 to find the answer to each table. 2 4 5 7 9 16 8 17 4 40 12 50 7 64 14 64 10 90 16 1 48 11 60 18 61 10 180 20 181 20 182 22 183 23 184 24 186 27 190 28 198 29 200 31 203 32 206 33 207 34 208 35 209 34, I hope this article is helpful for you.\n10) 9 * 9 = 7 9 * 138 = 118 157.99, m 1.67.

There are many benefits to learning the table of all digits. These benefits include learning to count, the ability to master basic arithmetic, and also having a better understanding how things work. 50, m 1.67, The table is used often in various classes because it is the easiest way for students to learn the rules. For example, students could use this table to get their multiplication table. The table is much more than a set of number names. It contains valuable information that helps students learn more about math.\nThis article explains how the Table can be a helpful tool for students. 10 * 7 = 0.998, m 1.67. Many people consider learning the Table to be pointless or just another boring activity. It can be both these things. However, learning the Table can help make your children better at math. It will also help them become faster at math. 7) 20 * 4 = 180 20 * 5 = 120 20 * (496) = 120 180 * 6 = 121 180 * (496) = 121. 105, m 1.67. What are 10 Facts About multiplication? 3:22.\n45, It is often easier to remember the table from numbers 1-20.\nBut, it turns out that there are at least 10 facts about multiplication. There are many ways to do multiplication. Some people only do one thing per table. Other people use the table of all digits as their answer. If you do the multiplication using all digits, then you could count all the letters on the table. You could also look for any repeating symbols on the table.\nIt is not enough to just know the number in the table. You need to be able to use the symbols on the table to understand what the table can do. You will be able to understand what each symbol stands for and how they are connected. The table can be used to help you understand how things work and how to use the symbols to solve problems.\nFor example, if you want to add two numbers together, you can add them together using the + symbol. This would tell you what the sum of one and two is. The sum of one and two would make a difference in the way you add things.\nMath can be difficult to master, especially if you don\u2019t understand the basic rules and formulas. Learning the table will make it easier for students to learn math. Also, it will allow students to do more in math class. 6) 4 * 3 = 12 * 1 = 496, A Table is something every student should know how to use. It can be very helpful for students during class and in other activities. The table is also useful for students in other subjects and tests. For example, students could use the table to figure out how many hours of a school class they had studied that day.\nPrevious articleWhat Is a TikToker?\nNext articleHow to Make a Folding Frame in Minecraft\n2651081 - 16 April 2023 <0.0.0 a>", "num_tokens_generated": 1194, "OGF": 0.29150390625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 27.252196311950684, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 154, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

It is a huge difference comparing modern and primitive people because modern people have great innovation and high level of education as compared to primitive people that have the technology less and has less education. However, both Mars in the world has different type of lifestyles with several reasons. First, they have their own culture and religion of what they believe in their world, the Mars have their own government and ways of living and both has different religion. In addition, there are several differences between the two types because both Mars and the world has different way of life. 2. Analyze how this story is different from contemporary and/or past literary works. Explain the significance of the differences. \u201cThe Martian\u201d is very different from other contemporary stories and in fact, there have been other stories that have been done but most are a remake of the original. There has been other movies where the idea is similar to what was told in the novel such as \u201cThe Core\u201d and \u201cMission to Mars\u201d. The story in the novel and those movies are all very similar with the exception of how the movie was done because it was a bit more of the science fictional type. Also, the story was different because the other movies were about getting to Mars and getting home. The story in \u201cThe Martian\u201d is about how an astronaut got stranded on Mars and how he is going to get back to Earth. Another difference from other novels is the way it was written. In other......\n...The Red Planet In this documentary, we see a number of Mars rovers exploring space, and doing amazing things to figure out what the Red planet really is like. It looks like a red planet, yes, but what else could it possibly be like? NASA and other space organizations are putting out millions of dollars in research just to find out what we are up against when we actually do land on Mars. This film follows the space craft to Mars, and how the spacecraft is supposed to land on our future home planet. The rover that NASA sends to Mars is supposed to have an extremely long life, and exploring as much as it can. That said, many times the rover has been in trouble, and they have had to revise the way the rovers do their work in order to make sure that they are able to accomplish it. We learn a lot about what the rock layers of Mars actually are, and how we are able to get a very decent idea of the terrain and the topography of Mars. There have been a large number of false assumptions and wrong ideas about what Mars is like in the past, but this documentary shows us that now we have a very good idea about what we could actually be looking at when we go to Mars. From a more scientific stand point, we see how the atmosphere of Mars affects the atmosphere of Earth. Mars has very little atmosphere, so when it actually comes in contact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it is still able to affect the weather patterns that Earth goes through. It is pretty interesting that such a small......\nMars in the Media\n...Mars in the Media - Final Project 1) This article addresses Mars as a resource rich planet that humans will one day have the chance to colonize, as opposed to Earth. From the information presented above in the article that seems to be the majority of the article, as it presents a \u201cwhat if\u201d situation. The author takes us on a \u201cwhat could happen in the future\u201d type of situation, where humanity is colonizing Mars. He seems to try and persuade the reader that we can and we will one day colonize Mars. Although the author does provide us with reasons to believe this may be possible we still have no real proof that humans will indeed be able to colonize Mars or that it is at all feasible. We are currently doing our best to build humanity toward a star ship capable of traveling to the Moon, let alone Mars. I don\u2019t see us in our current state of affairs being able to colonize Mars. From a more science fiction stand point this article does provide us with a great insight based upon knowledge of how our history has been written up to this point and it gives insight into the future. I wouldn\u2019t say that this article is scientifically correct in all aspects of the article, as there is no hardcore evidence it is merely based. This article is a great depiction of what the future may hold, even though it may not be true what could be is worth seeing. 2) This film was a documentary about the future Mars, the problems that we may face when we have to live on this new world, and then it shows us through a variety of different...\n...Was Mars the planet that came second to the Earth or was it one of the greatest planet for life or no life at all? The truth is we will never know. The story of Mars was one that took many people a lot of time to decide whether it was a planet that could be colonized or not by humans. The article, \u201cMars, the Red Planet!\u201d by Robert Zubrin, tells a story about how life may not be possible on Mars since it is a planet so far away and a planet with no atmosphere. If life were to exist on this planet, it would be difficult for it to do so. According to Robert Zubrin, Mars can be colonized with good luck because it was once believed that the red planet wasn\u2019t very hospitable for animals, people, or other forms of life. The colonization of Mars would require huge spaceships and rockets to take people to the moon and then from there to Mars. Although this would be the best method of getting to Mars, it would be very difficult because it would be very dangerous and would take a long time. The problem that may occur is that if we don\u2019t go through with colonization in the near future we will never get to see if there is life on Mars. If we do not go through with colonization soon, by the time we know all the possible results, it may be too late. Robert Zubrin points out the pros and cons of colonizing Mars. He states that colonization would be both positive and negative if done incorrectly. The positive side to colonization is that if we find any form of life on Mars......\n...(1980) In 2012, scientists at NASA found out that certain areas of the planet Mars have the ingredients for it to support life in the future. Mars, is the smallest planet within our solar system, in relation to planets, it is the fourth planet from the sun. It is not quite as small as the moon but it\u2019s close because the moon is 8 times smaller than Mars. Due to Mars having so little water, the planet was named after the Roman deity for war, Mars, and with such little water it must create its own sources for water. Some of these include polar ice caps, snow, and minerals. All the minerals in Mars are very valuable to us. This is because the minerals in Mars are very rich with different and very rare kinds of metals. These types of metals are a necessity to the development of future types of technology because they are very highly valued by researchers and scientists. Not only are the minerals rich in rare metals, they are also necessary for the future of space exploration. These minerals are important to the development of space travel because mineral fuel is needed to keep space technology moving. Another thing that makes the planet Mars very important is, although it is dry it does have other resources, such as soil and air. The soil on Mars is a very valuable resource because it is the richest source of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Due to Mars being located on our galaxy\u2019s edge, its soil has been polluted a lot of many different types of gases.......\nHuman Colonization of Mars\n...Human Colonization of Mars Abstract This paper is about the feasibility that humans should or shouldn\u2019t colonize the Red Planet. In order to answer this question, we must first understand the definition of the word colonization. \u201cTo found a colony; set up a permanent home in a new place; settle upon new ground\u201d (Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1997, p. 211); as well as what would qualify as a colony. A colony defined as \u201ca political subdivision that is a dependent territory having a government separate from that of the dependent state, with the status of an internal integral part of the metropolitan state\u201d (American Heritage dictionary of the English Language 1981, p. 355). The planet Mars may satisfy and support a human presence for many generations, but we shouldn\u2019t overstep our bounds by becoming too aggressive and expanding too quickly in space. I\u2019ll go into detail as to why this idea of colonizing Mars is too much of a good thing. The Planet Mars As of the early 2000s, there were nine spacecraft circling the planet Mars, including five orbiters, a rover, and two landers. The Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Mariner 9, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Polar Lander, Spirit, Opportunity (Science 8/7/2009), and Phoenix, all sent back tons of data. The rovers have covered more ground on Mars than previous rovers (Mariner) combined. \u201cThey [Phoenix and Spirit] also found that water ice is abundant on Mars\u2026\u201d These missions will help prepare scientists to explore......\n...What's all that red stuff? * Red dirt * It's Martian and contains no water Mars has 2 large landslides: * Opportunity landed on the first slide * Spirit landed on the second slide Mars is a cold desert Mars is about half the size of Earth Mars is the most alien planet ever to capture human imagination, for much of history, people have doubted that it exists at all and have dismissed as foolishness those who believed it did. The Earth and Mars are both the only known planets in our solar system to host life, and so we have a shared history and culture that includes an interest in the distant red planet - a fascination born out of human curiosity, science and mythology. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and has been known since ancient times. The planet Mars is often referred to as the \u2018Red Planet\u2019 due to its distinctive large rust-coloured polar ice caps. Mars is sometimes called the \u2018War Planer\u2019 but this association is due to ancient Roman and Greek deities who were involved in the art of war. On June 5, 2003, a Mars Exploration Rover named Spirit landed near the equatorial sand dunes of Mars. Spirit was designed for a mission of approximately 90 days, however after 5 years on the Martian surface, Spirit remains a fully functioning lander sending back precious data. Spirit has covered about 5 kilometers (almost 3 miles) on Mars. In March of 2006 Spirit was overtaken by its sister rover......\n...House of Mars in Hindu Mythology Mars, the planet, was called Bhavam in Sanskrit. He was an enemy of the gods and therefore was exiled from Vala and was condemned to live on Earth, but the love of the gods overwhelmed their distaste for him and he was made the deity of a quarter of the world. As the son of Pushan, the deity of prosperity, the god of war was said to control the destinies of kings and the fates of soldiers in battle. His wife was Rohini, the wife of Chandra, and his son was Kartikeya, the god worshipped by the warrior classes and the Shaivites. His brothers are Agni, Vayu, Indra and Surya. In Hindu mythology, he is called Bhava (\u201cthe Destroyer\u201d), which is the same word that means \u2018starry\u2019 and \u2018fiery\u2019. In the Vedas (Atharva Veda 19.25.1) , Mars is the son of Rudradhwaja (the creator-god Brahma) and is the great grandson and son of Tvastar. (Tvastar is the third son of Brahma, and Rudradhwaja is the fourth son of Tvastar. Rudradhwaja is thus Mars\u2019 great grandfather.) In the Vedic pantheon , Mars is the son of Rudra, and in turn he is the father of Kartikeya (Skanda or Murugan, \u201cthe Little Warrior\u201d). He is also called Mangala, (the Hindu word for Mars in astrology), Bhadra, Vishvedeva, Rohitasya, Krutaruna, Vasukara, Bhava, Savitarka, etc. Mars is the brother of Bhaga, Brihaspati (Jupiter) and Varuna (Water), and twin brother of Kuja (Anger, Venus). In a cosmology, Brahma\u2019s first son is Prahlada, who is credited with the creation of Vedic knowledge (Svargah,......\nColonize Mars\n...Colonize Mars We have a chance to do something that has never been done. To colonize one of the planets of the very solar systems we call \u201cHome\u201d; Mars. While many people say we can\u2019t or will never have the money to do so. It is a possibility, there have already been many studies put forth on how to do even have the resources to make this possible. The first is the transport of people and the amount of space they actually need to reside. The second is how to produce and grow food on the red planet and lastly the actual construction of their homes on Mars itself. At this time in history we can afford to start a colony on Mars. We may see a period in which the cost of space travel may decrease, and we might see a colony set up as people are still paying mortgages back home. It is also thought that this could decrease since more and more people will have this as a way to earn an income, and the fact that you would have no rent to pay. Although more studies would be needed to prove all this possible, right now the odds are certainly leaning the way of establishing a colony on Mars. The second part of this is producing and growing food. One of the first things that would need to be done is to gather as many resources as possible from around the planet. If by any chance, we could build this colony with resources gathered from around the planet. The people that settled would find it easier in the beginning. The more resources we have the easier it will be to grow food for the......\n... The Red Planet \u201cIf you wish to learn how to conquer a world, you must begin by taking hold of the colony.\u201d Jean Rostand. There is an ancient saying that \u201cRome was not built in one day\u201d. However, it was built out of determination and hard work by the Romans. Similarly, conquering, colonizing, and exploring has always been in our human nature. Man has wanted to explore the furthest reaches of the ocean and the skies. In 1610, Galileo Galilei was the first person to take a telescope to another planet. He observed several moons and other objects in the surface of this planet. These discoveries made him the most famous scientist in the world and the most famous of the astronomers, before Copernicus. \u201cThe planet Mars\u201d (1980) written by Robert Zubrin was published by the \u201cDiscover\u201d magazine. The author used this writing to describe the Red Plane which is called Mars and to tell his audience about the planets past, present and its future. Zubrin used the facts of science and history such like an essay and compared it to an entertaining, engaging and persuasive speech, to persuade the reader to the \u201cred planet\u201d and its colonization. He started off with telling about the history of Mars. In a nut shell, he wanted to tell about how Mars has always been an interesting planet to the human beings. Even though we could not see or hear anything from the planet, but it still remains an amazing and outstanding place in our human nature to colonize it. He then continued his writing...\n...In today\u2019s world, technology is everything. Without technology the world as we now it would not exist. If Mars had any water in it would be the best place to look to live in. We could live in a colony within the walls of a volcano that has water. The environment on Mars has the right components with water and carbon dioxide that it needs to support life. We are looking for ways to explore the planet of Mars, while being able to live and grow stronger in population. We would use nuclear fusion energy that is safe and easy to use. There is a possibility that the planet of Mars had once had life upon it. Fossils from the planet have been discovered such as fossilized beetles. There is more recent evidence on the planet of Mars that shows organic molecules. Life is a possibility on the planet. The planet has the right components that it needs for life to thrive. Humans have colonized other planets before in the moon, but there is more life on the planet than the moon. They found microbial mats on the surface, and are evidence that their was once an ocean on the planet. We also found more organic matter than what was found in other planets. These are signs of life on the planet as well as the fossilized creatures. The temperature on the planet is -60 degrees C. This shows that it is not ideal for living organisms to survive on the surface of the planet without protection. There are ways that living creatures can survive on Mars though. If people were to live on Mars,......\n...The Possibility of Colonizing Mars Although it may be difficult to believe, Mars, often considered to be our closest neighbor could very well be our gateway to the great unknown. There are many people who share this belief. In fact, according to Dr. Robert Zubrin, author of the essay \u201cThe Red Planet\u201d, there are many things on Mars that could possibly support life, and make it an ideal place for human colonization. Dr. Zubrin argues that the following criteria should be met in order to begin colonization: sufficient natural resources, the atmosphere, climate and seasons, gravity, access to energy and minerals, and abundant areas for potential habitation. Of the seven criteria given, it is apparent that we presently have met all of them (Zubrin 72). The first element that is the most important is the need for food to colonists. It is the first thing that the colony needs for survive on the food, and water are the most element important things in life to colonize Mars....\n...The Red Plane What we can learn about us?
