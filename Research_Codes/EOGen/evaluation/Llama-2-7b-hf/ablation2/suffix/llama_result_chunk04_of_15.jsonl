You can choose which technologies to use but please stick with the theme of the project and keep with the ideas you initially communicated to me.\n\nThe main points for the Week 7 demo are:\n\n* Your ideas from Week 2 must be fully communicated to me in either your presentation or your document submission.\n* You should either present your product as a live demo or as a screencast.  Either is acceptable but keep with the project theme.\n* The document should be submitted as a PDF file to both me (Mike) and your instructor.\n* Your final presentation file should be submitted to the Week7 folder in the class GitHub repository on Friday.  Remember that this is an online course;  submitting your file at the very last minute will not be tolerated.\n\nIf your project doesn\u2019t demonstrate the technology theme and ideas in Weeks 2 and 3, I will not provide you a passing grade for Week 7 but I may still give you a passing grade since there were some issues with the COVID-19 situation.\n\n#### Submission Requirements\n\n* The PDF document will be e-mailed to both me and your class instructor.  This document has a maximum size of 10 pages and includes sections about the scope of your idea, your technology choices, security, privacy, user experience (UX) and other appropriate design elements.  It should be submitted in a Microsoft Word file which will be converted to pdf format.  If your project is submitted on time but doesn\u2019t follow the submission instructions, you will not submit your grade or your credit.\n\n* PowerPoint presentations must be video recorded and uploaded in the Week 7 folder in your online course folder.  I will accept video presentations that are between 10 minutes to 20 minutes in length.\n\n* Video presentations can also be shared with your instructor.\n\n#### Week 8 - Wrapping Up\n\nThis week, I want you to reflect on your experiences through this course.  What did you learn from this experience?  How did it increase your understanding of software development?   In the document, I want to see about your thoughts of the future and in what areas do you want to continue to learn?  Maybe you are interested in learning about security?  Or the Cloud, or mobile.  What?  I want to see about your career objectives and how this course affected them. You can use this week to write down your thoughts and submit it to both me and your instructor with a pdf format submission.\n\nIf you complete all the assignments, you will receive 10 extra points above the final grade calculation.\n", "num_tokens_generated": 623, "OGF": 0.152099609375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 14.471406936645508, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 94, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

FilterMar forgot Spanish BothPI", "generated_output": "LAS and PILCAS are built on top of the Python filter framework. They operate similarly in that they both define a number of data structures and utility methods, but they differ on a foundational level.\nA CAS is a collection of objects. As such it is a collection of Python, a language that is primarily object oriented in nature. This is a different approach to computing than procedural languages. Both are valid models for solving problems. The decision to choose one over the other should be informed, as it affects the design, implementation, and maintenance of your software. Each approach has design principles that drive how a system is implemented, and should not be selected merely because a team or individual is more versed in one versus the other. A procedural program consists of a number of statements that are executed one-by-one to perform a task. In the procedural model, the data is passed from one part of the program to another for the purpose of performing a task on that data. By contrast, in the object oriented paradigm you find a concept known as encapsulation that allows one (but often more than one) data structure to determine how that data is processed throughout the program.\nFor example, the following simple program calculates the average of three numbers: def calc_avg(a, b, c): return (a+b+c) / 3 print calc_avg(0, 0, 0) print calc_avg(1, 1, 1) # Output: 2 2 If you modify this to include variables of class-based data type, it is possible to automatically determine the class of the variable in order to perform more sophisticated processing on it: class Averages(): def __init__(self, numbers): self.numbers = numbers def calc_avg(self): return sum(self.numbers) / len(self.numbers) print Averages(0, 0, 0).calc_avg() print Averages(1, 1, 1).calc_avg() # Output: 2 2.2 In this example, the calc_avg method is executed to determine the average on behalf of the Averages object.\nThis is all possible because object oriented programming encourages you to define data structures with accessors and methods that manipulate the data. Procedural programming focuses on the order of operations, whereas object oriented programming focuses on objects. The two can work harmoniously together, but the distinction should not be ignored.\nDefine OOPS and POPS and describe their main features and characteristics. Give  code examples  explain how they differ in terms of syntax, semantics, and design principles.\nFilterMar forgot Spanish BothPILAS and PILCAS are built on top of the Python filter framework. They operate similarly in that they both define a number of data structures and utility methods, but they differ on a foundational level.\nThere exist a dozen major languages (LISP, Pascal, Pascal, C++ and so forth). But their syntax differs significantly, and therefore they require different techniques and programming styles. Also, some languages are easier to learn than others, but that should not be your foremost consideration; they are all object-oriented.\nOOP is a concept that originated in 1967, but was not really used to a large degree until the late 1990s. It is a method to manage complexity in applications, and also a method to describe systems where the relationships between objects is complex. Here is an example of OOP, written in the \"object-oriented\" language Java:\nThe OOPS consists of objects, methods, variables, classes, and inheritance.\nAn object is some data and associated methods. Like variables, they are used as local storage in various methods. But unlike variables, objects are also an entity, meaning that methods can be defined on them:\nHere is also an example of an object in C:\nThe POPS defines programs as collections of basic entities that are constructed by a programming language. The concept of a program is that it consists of a collection of entities and relationships between these units. The data is passed around from one unit to another so to create the output. For example, here is a POPS example in the programming language LISP:\nBoth OOP and POPS are programming languages, and therefore they both have syntax. That is where the similarity ends. In the OOP case, the syntax is often a key part of the language, as objects and inheritance are based on defining entities and relationships between entities. In POPS, as well as in other \"programming languages\", the syntax is often just a convention used to describe how to represent those entities. In order to use objects in a POPS programming language, you will need a system that supports objects and relationships between those objects.\nBoth OOPS and POPS are programming languages, but there are many other languages that support different object-oriented systems, such as the object databases.\nWhile the concepts of OOP and OOPS are similar, most programming languages do not support OOP but rather just POPS. OOP does exist for various languages, but there is no single way of defining OOP for all languages. OOP does require different types of data structures and operations, such as classes, inheritance, and so forth. But not all languages that support objects support those types.\nOOPS is a general object-oriented paradigm that is applicable to any programming language that supports objects. It does not mean that they support classes, inheritance and so forth. Those concepts come from other object-oriented systems such as the object database and object repositories.\nBoth methods are in the OOP system. The OOPS is more or less a set of programming languages that support objects and object-oriented concepts. It does not mean that the language supports inheritance, classes, and so forth.\nThese are the names of the language that use classes. The \"class\" is the lowest level of abstraction that can be described by programming languages. It's a container that can be reused by any type of data structure, and it's used to represent data and computation. In this way, you can also think of classes as \"methods of objects,\" as they can be used in combination with other operations to describe objects. For example, you can describe a collection as a \"List\" object. The difference between the OOPS and POPS is the fact that the POPS is used to describe objects using other programming languages, while the OOPS uses classes to describe objects in Java.\nOOPS and POPS are a set of programming languages that have different object-oriented approaches to describing what could be called \"objects\". OOPS is one implementation of the same set of OOPS, while POPS is a system that implements the concepts of the OOPS, but with different semantics.\nBoth OOPS and POPS are programming languages, but there are many other languages that support different object-oriented systems, such as the object database.\nOOPS and POPS differ in a number of things, but the main difference is that they have different methods for describing objects. OOPS uses objects to describe objects, while OOPS uses types of objects to describe objects. So, while they use different objects, they both use the same concepts.\nOOPS is a set of programming languages that are implemented on the basis of OOPS concepts. These include object-oriented programming languages and object-relational databases. In short, it is a set of languages (e.g. Java and Python) which define their own object-oriented models.\nWhen you speak of POPS (pure object-oriented programming languages), you speak of languages with the same semantics, which means that they are using a similar semantic space. OOPS, on the other hand, is a set of languages with different semantics and does not define an object-oriented model in the first place. OOP is considered to be object-oriented programming, but what they share is the idea that objects must not be tied to a specific data model, but instead they must be modelable by different data types.\nFor example consider a class representing a list, and if you create an object for the list it would be a class, not an object.\nIn this way POPS and OOP (which is what I just described as the OOPS) are different concepts:\nOOPS consists of a few classes which share a common semantic space.\nPOPS does not have a semantic space (which means it will have different types of objects).\nSo there you have it, the main idea of OOP is that any class can be used as the base of an object. In other words it is not a requirement that a class has to have \"data\" in it first, you may also add \"data\" later.\nAs I said in my previous post:\nthe main difference between the OOPS and POPS is that in OOPS you can define an object but in POPS you can't and you have to use interfaces instead.\nThe object-oriented programming paradigm describes objects and the relationships between objects. Examples of objects include a \"cat\", an \"ice cream\" and a \"car\". Object-oriented programming is about using these objects, and describing their behavior and related behaviors.\nObjects are an abstraction, and it does not matter what abstraction you use to communicate the same information. In the OOPS it is possible to communicate the same information using an object, using a set of methods, and using properties. You can also use different types of data structures to express the same information.\nThe OOPS relies on a particular set of data structures (e.g., a single instance) and methods (which are called methods for the OOPS, but are often called methods in the POPS). The OOPS relies on objects as well as other data structure, but not all languages that are object-oriented also support objects. Thus, the OOPS relies on a single object with a set of properties.\nOOPS is a programming language, and there are many programming languages that support object-oriented concepts. But the OOPS language requires certain objects to be created on top of it. For example, it may require you to create a set of objects called \"properties\". For example, if you want to create a \"cat\", then you have to create a set of cats, and each cat contains a property called \"name\" which stores a string value. If you want to create a \"car\", you will need a set of cars, and each car is a property with a value.\nThe POPS programming language does not require this kind of object creation, nor does it use the OOPS. Instead, it uses data structures which have the same structure and types, but do not use the OOPS, which has a different structure and different types. For example, POPS does not use objects in order to store the data, but instead uses \"objects\" or \"lists\".\nThe POPS is a programming language that is similar to the OOPS, but with different syntax and semantics. It is used to run the same application as OOPS but it is different, because it supports different programming styles.[1]\nThese are just some examples. In general, POPS and OOPS are quite different, but also similar, since the OOPS uses the same data structures, but just in different ways. Thus, it is possible to describe objects in both program languages using the same data structures, but they have different names and types.\nObjects can be either data or code. They are usually data and they usually have a special function (a class or an instance method). The only types of object in C/C++ are \"class\" and \"object\". In Java, however, the object is the unit of inheritance and therefore the object can be derived from another object. A class is a special collection of data and special functions that describes how it can be used to perform tasks. A class can have multiple (many) instances. A \"class\" is an object with unique name and its own identity. This class is called the \"class\" (or \"class object\" in C/C++ terminology), because it has a unique name, and it has its own identity, which can be shared with another object, but not with the object that created it. This class is called \"class of object\" for this reason.\nAn object can be either data or code.\nThe main difference between OOPS and POPS is that in C it is \"objects\" or data but in POPS it is \"classes\" or code. In C/C++ it is the same thing, but in C/C++ it is called the \"class\" (or \"class object\" in C/C++ terminology) and in POPS it is called a \"class\".\nThe main difference between the OOPS and POPS is the method of defining classes:\nClasses in OOPS\nClasses in POPS\nClasses in OOPS are used to manage data and to define methods which are used to perform operations on objects. Classes can be defined as follows:\nObject-based data types (e.g. char) Objects\nA class can be:\nA collection of data A collection of objects\nA function A method\nClasses are used to manage data and to define methods which are used to perform operations on objects in Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS). If you try to describe the behavior of an object with data type \"char\" (char is a scalar type whose value is a sequence of bytes with a special notation) then you need to use an object with data type \"object\" (object is a multidimensional object with a special notation). This description is called description of a class as it is a class and if you describe an object then you have to define a new object with data type \"object\". This is the classical way to define a class in OOPS.\nObject programming languages use classes to describe data and methods to describe how objects interact. For instance, a car may be described as a four-wheel, four-passenger vehicle. However, in Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) such a description may be extended to cover a broader range of possibilities, such as the addition of wheels and seats, or the replacement of a passenger or driver seat with a trunk.\nYou can think of a class in C++ as being composed of data as well as methods. Both C++ object and C++ class can contain other data. The difference between a class and a C++ object is that a class's methods are private but can be accessed by other classes by using the \"this\" pointer. Classes may also contain their own instances. This is an important distinction because a class, unlike an object, may also contain a private method that is not exposed to the rest of the program.\nIn contrast, in Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) object objects are typically implemented in code. They thus share the same state and, if they are written correctly, have a very consistent, consistent state. For\nI am going to use the following C++ language as an example: The class Car is a very simple class defined as follow:\npublic: // public member functions const // const access specifier const: int, int int int _car_state const: string, void string string; // the public part of the class // public property void get_name() { cout << \"My car's name is:\" << get_name() << endl; } void set_name() {} // the private part of the class private: void get_name() { cout << \"My car's name is:\" << get_name() << endl; } void set_name() {}\nIn the example above we have one object (MyCar) that holds the public member functions, and then a private member function. Therefore the following statement would be valid: MyCar.get_name()\nCertainly, this is not the only example of object-orientation, but I find it a good example to demonstrate the main features of objects.\nTo be fair, most of the languages in my list don't take the OOPS approach of having all objects share their base class (e.g., Car). However, I think that approach would certainly be better than using the OO approach, where there is no guarantee that all objects inherit the base class. Even in C++, the standard library doesn't have a concept of object inheritance at all. As such, these languages could certainly be considered object-oriented, though perhaps not as much as they are presented in my list.\nIn this approach, we have classes, which are defined in C++, and classes inherit from their base classes. But again, not all languages will support that model. For example, in Java, all interfaces are classes, so inheritance is not supported.\nOOP is a general programming paradigm where objects are modeled from the outside in. POPS is another paradigm where objects are modeled from the inside out. Thus, in OOPS, the idea is that there is a common set of rules that apply to every object as well as the same set of rules that apply to classes. In POPS, each object is defined as a class and you can also have a subclass of any class.\nObjects are data. Objects can be anything from a text field to a class instance. In general, they are instances and are only instantiated when needed. In a procedural programming language, objects are instances. There are many types of objects but by far the most common one is the data object, which is what a variable is, but that's a topic for another post.\nIn this case, the OOPS, POPS, and C++ are all languages that support object-oriented programming languages. All of those languages support objects, but there may be some differences in how they are modeled. For example, Objective-C has an object-oriented syntax that is closer to C++, while Java and Python both have a syntax that is similar to other object-oriented programming languages.\nAs mentioned, both OOPS and POPS have an object-oriented syntax. However, they are different from many other object-oriented programming languages in that both are object-oriented languages. In C++, for example, data is typically represented through structs and classes are used to represent objects (including instances and pointers). But in Java, for example, data is typically represented through interfaces, which are defined by methods, and classes are defined by inheritance. You can think of a class as a definition of a data structure and a definition of an object, while a struct is a data structure.\nOOPS and POPS are not quite as different as they seem. They have different syntax, they use different terms, but the idea of how a class is used is the same.\nOOPS and POPS use classes and interfaces to describe data structures. For instance, you can represent a car with this:\nOne way to do so would be with a diagram of using the object, however, classes. For example, the class, a Classes.\nSome are interfaces may also be a data types. These may be a simple data model\nThere are classes may be implemented using methods. For example, methods, to perform an instance an action the same can be applied to as methods to do this\nThis is used to represent a called a structure in OOPS\nHowever, OOPS data object may be not represent it has been OOPS the object is not\nThis is is an as an object the structure, however, is OOPS data. The are object can be OOP however, is be a\nbe object's not is an object's to represent the a data an OOPS\nAs is the data. As an object,\nThere are in some data, to it is be the object, is the structure, and it is a data,\nThere are to structure are an object-object-object, they are data are\nare\nis an objects are be using are objects are used to object- are being, there is a structure of\nare object be used to the structure.to be data\nIn C++ OOPS, objects, they are object is there are used as object model of a data C++ used an object is an object is be defined by model is defined in a by them and may be defined of OOP is model, and an object.

A function is defined by an interface and is supposed to accept string as parameter and to return the string type only but it is receiving an integer. What problem does this point to? The function must be an inner class. The function must be anonymous. The function may be a static method. This code may lead to an error.\n12. Which of the statements are correct about the code segment?(A) The program will not produce an array but it will create a new String Array of one string. * (B) There is no value of \u201ci\u201d for the int i = 0 ;(C) i variable cannot be accessed in the main method from the class.

The for statement The if statement The while statement\n19. Which of the following would not be possible programming in a JVM if there was no class file? A class file is a class. The class file contains instructions of the class. The name of a class is irrelevant. An instruction is executed line by line.\n20. You have a class that will only allow two subclasses in Java, those are PingClass and PongClass. Define a class that will instantiate PingClass. A class that extends PingSubClass. A subclass of the class that will extend PongSubClass. A class (or non-extending subclass) that implements the ping method.\n21. What are the advantages of using an Interface over an Abstract Class? Interfaces allows you to define publicly visible methods. Interfaces allow you to avoid creating a complete implementation. Interfaces can easily be reused between different projects. Interfaces are not related to any type of object.\n22. Which of them is not true? The method name must start with the correct type's name. Methods without a return type are declared abstract. When a class has an abstract method it can inherit it. In order for an abstract method to be called it must have a concrete implementation.\n23. Which of the following will throw a compile time error? void doStuff(new Integer(2)); void doStuff(int[] b); protected static void doStuff(ArrayList b); protected static void doStuff(List b); void doStuff(Map b);\n24. What is the difference between the following? new Integer (10) new Number (10) new Integer[10] new Long[10]\n25. What is wrong with the following snippet? class Animal { abstract void feed (); } void eat () { System.out.println(\"Eat\");} class Cat extends Animal { public void feed () { eat(); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void feed () { System.out.println (\"Feed\");} } ... class Animal\n26.

Which is in the following is (or not) an interface?\n30. Which of the following statements are correct? A variable declared using a reference type will hold the address of an object. Objects are allocated on stack. Objects are allocated on heap.\n31. Which of the following statements are correct? An abstraction is the implementation of some code. An abstraction is a function. An abstraction is a method and is a part of inheritance. An abstraction is the specification of a method/function.\n32. Which statement doesn\u2019t apply to an abstract method? It allows the subtype to declare the method implementation. It allows the subtype to provide default or alternate implementation. It mustn\u2019t be defined in the subtype. It forces the subtype to provide an implementation.\n33. The following code snippet is incorrect. How would you correct? public class Animal implements Animal { private String id; public void getName() { System.out.println (\"Animal: \" + this . name); } public abstract void feed (); public abstract void speak (); } public class Cat extends Animal { protected String name; public void getName () { System.out.println (\"Cat: \" + this . name); } public void feed () { System.out.println (\"Feed cat\"); } public void speak () { System.out.println (\"Meow\"); } }\n34. Java is not memory wastful since objects are allocated on the heap. This will lead to memory leak. The memory for objects allocated on the heap can only by reused. The memory for objects allocated on the heap can be reclaimed when the object go out of scope. The memory for objects allocated on the heap can be reused but there is no guarantee.\n35. If an object instance of a class extends a class, are the subobjects of the superclass? True False\n36. Which of the following statement is incorrect? If an interface contains an abstract method which is implemented in a class or its subclass, the interface contains implicit implementation for that abstract method. A class can define an abstract method on top of another abstract method on a superclass. A class can redefine a method on a superclass. A class can redefine the entire interface.\n37. Which of the following option is the interface?\n38. Which of the following statements are correct? An interface cannot be a subclass of any other interface. If a class is an interface it cannot also be a sub- interface. The name of an Interface can be used as the name of the class. Interfaces cannot be extended or implemented.\n39. Which of the following statement is correct?\n40. Which statement is incorrect about the interface? It\u2019s not used to specify how an implementation is provided. A class that implements an interface must also extend any abstract classes defined by the interface. Extending an interface is defined in the class in the type annotation. The type of an interface can be extended by another type and the super interface is not allowed to be accessed.\n41. Which statement is true about an abstract class? It must be extended with the subclasses to get complete functionality. An abstract class cannot be inherited. It cannot be a superclass. It cannot include a primary constructor if the superclass does include one.\n44. A. In a subclass of abstract class. A class cannot be both abstract and not implement an abstract interface. B. An abstract class cannot implement either an interface or an abstract class. C. In a subclass of abstract class if its interface is not defined as abstract. D. When you declare a variable, you need to specify a type of either: a Class or an Interfaced. You may get the message \u201cCannot create variable abstract_foo , type abstract_foo cannot be resolved to a type.\u201d When implementing an interface, you must also extend the abstract class the interface defines. You may get the message \u201cabstract_foo is not a static variable and cannot be initiated in a static context.\u201d\n45. Which of the following method is true? When accessing a method that is defined in a base class, use a type of the extended class. When accessing a method that is defined in a base class, use a type of the extended interface. When accessing a method that is defined in a base class. use a type of the extended interface. The class that defines an interface is the implementing class.\n46. Which of the following methods statement is incorrect? To use the Java API, you need some classes to be imported (from the import statement) or to reference them explicitly via their fully qualified name (classname.methodname(parameter);. The Java API allows interfaces, classes, methods and fields. They are all implemented as a language mechanism called class. The syntax is not a very good one for Java.\n47. Which of the following statements are true? An abstract class may be used as a super-class. An abstract class may implement multiple interfaces. An abstract class cannot be inherited. A class that is an abstract class cannot implement an interface. Abstract classes can only extend other abstract classes.\n48. The following will produce a compile time error: class A\n49. The following will produce a runtime error: class abstract A\n50. It is good style not to use the \u201cextends\u201d keyword in a function definition. This is not the case and you get an error. An Abstract class can have a primary constructor that gets data arguments. All derived classes are inherited the Abstract class as it is defined in the base class. The Abstract class may be defined on top of the superclass.\n51. The following code snippet will produce a runtime error: class A\n52. The following statement is true about interfaces? An interface can be extended. A class may make a concrete implementations for an interface. An interface can only declare methods and variables with default values. An interface declares the number of method that are present. There may be more than one method declared in an interface. An interface can be implemented by more than one class. A class may not implement an interface.\n53. The following will result into a runtime error? class abstract extends A { }\n54. Which of the following code segment is incorrect? public static void main(String[] args) { System . out . println (new Integer [1]+ new Double [] );\n55. What statements are not true about extending? Extending is a common OOPS concept in Java. An interface is declared in a class that extends another class. You can extend multiple class and interfaces. You can have extend for class, interface or even for itself.\n56. What statement is incorrect about Class object? It\u2019s the same as the variable name. A class is not an instance and must be an object of itself. The Class class can be used to cast a reference variable. Class is not supported in the language of Java.\n57. What statement is incorrect about interfaces? They are used to specify an interface. They are used to define a contract. They are used to define a class. They provide a reference to an interface or class.\n58. What statement is incorrect about a Class? A class is a subclass of object. A class can be extended. A class can\u2019t be a subtype of a class. A class can be used as an interface or abstract class. A class can be instantiated as an instance\n59. Which of the following statements is false? Subclass cannot have a constructor than a super-type object. Subclass can have a constructor that takes arguments. Subclass can define the same constructor than its super-type object. In order to define the constructor of a subclass, the class may first extend its super-type.\n60. A Java abstract class provides a partial implementation for the sub-interface. A java abstract class provides a method to be implemented in the sub- interface. A Java abstract class allows the type of the sub-interface and allows this class to be inherited. A Java abstract class allows the parent interface to provide an implementation. All of the above are true.\n61. The following method is wrong? class abstract A { public abstract void feedMe(int size_of_stomach); }\n62. You wrote a class that inherits from a class that also inherits from another class. What must you do to get it to compile? You must add the extend keyword before both class names. You must add the class keyword or extends before the name of the class that is being inherited. You must add the interface keyword before both class names. You must add the extends keyword before the class that is being inherited.\n63. A class may implement an interface and extends Abstract class or interface. An abstract class may implement interfaces and extend multiple interfaces. A class may not extend an interface. Neither. An abstract class may implement multiple interfaces.\n64. Which of the following code segment produces a runtime error? System . out . println (\"The Dog can smell.\".\n68.

Which of the following code segments produces a runtime error? public class abstract class A { abstract void speak(String s , boolean) }\n73. Which of the following produces a runtime error?\npublic abstract class A { abstract int getNumberOfCoolness(); } public class B extends A { int getNumberOfCoolness(){return 10;\n74. A class that extends the class B extends A in interface A. The class B is declared as an abstract class. The class B is declared as an interface. The class B is declared as abstract class. The implementation of the methods B is declared in the abstract A.\n75. A class that extends B extends A in the interface A is required to be an abstract class. The class B is declared as abstract. The class B is declared as an interface. The class A is declared as abstract. The class B is declared as an abstract class.\n76. An implementation of an abstract class may be extended many. In an interface, methods declared as abstract.\n77. Methods declared as abstract have all of the following properties EXCEPT? To be abstract, a method must be static. To be abstract, a method must not have any body. To be abstract, a method must be declared by default. To be abstract, a method must not be declared by the keyword public.\n78. Methods declared as abstract in Jave must be defined by the keyword public. To be abstract, a method must not have any body. To be abstract, a method may be declared by default. To be abstract, static methods must be declared by the keyword static.\n79. Method that are declared as abstract must be defined by the keyword public. To be abstract, a method may be declared by default. To be abstract, a method must not have any body. To be abstract, static methods must be declared by the keyword static..\n80. Which of the following statement is the correct usage of the \u201cextends\u201d keyword? An abstract class cannot be extended. A derived class is allowed to extend more than one abstract class. A derived class is allowed to extend one or more abstract classes. A derived class is allowed to extend the abstract classes only. No.\n81. Which of the following statements are incorrect about the \u2018extends\u2019 keyword in declaring a class? The \u2018extends\u2019 keyword is used to declare classes as being class. The \u2018extends\u2019 keyword is used to declare the class as being an interface. The \u2018extends\u2019 keyword is used to declare the superclass of the current class. The \u2018extends\u2019 keyword is used to declare the interfaces that can be inherited.\n82. An interface cannot be extended or implement. You cannot extend or implement an interface. An interface cannot have default or method implementation. You cannot extend multiple interfaces but you can implement multiple interfaces.\n83.

I am currently learning how MATLAB runs functions in blocks, especially on arrays or matrices. For example, when I run an if statement that is conditionally. if(a>=5) y=10 else y=5 end end a=2 x=1. a=10 x=10 f.\nHow does a function's return value get passed back to its caller without \"loops\"? That is, how can you get back from a function that took a single argument without explicitly calling another function that takes a single argument that might return what you want? The MATLAB R2006a Beta. I have a function that looks a little like this. y = @(x) (x>2) - 10; The MATLAB R2006a Beta documentation describes this as a \"block.\" But I. Matlab functions and parameters. Is it possible to pass variables to the function? To pass variables to the function, you need to make the variable global to avoid having an empty return value. But if the function has no global input variable to return, passing inputs to the function can cause errors. The Matlab function fliplr (flipped version of flipud) does exactly what it says (swapping the dimensions of its argument). FILP is a Matlab function defined by:.\nThe best known (and used) matrix transpose method was first devised by a student named George Stibitz, and was further studied and published by Frank Nelson Cole at Dartmouth in 1950. The two papers are titled \u201cThe Transpose Matrix\u201d and \u201cThe Transpose Matrix Revisited,\u201d respectively. Note that Cole refers to transpose as transformation (a trans-formation. A MATLAB\u00ae function is a set of statements that MATLAB\u00ae executes in sequence to compute a new number, set of numbers, or set of data. Functions provide a way to combine smaller pieces of code into a larger unit of work, so that you can reuse the computation over and over again. Functions return results by default, which you. MATLAB: Matrix to String function mtexpand is faster than textscan (see my previous post) and I assume it was made for situations like this. However, the documentation states that mtexpand converts a matrix to a string if the input is a Matrix, and to an array otherwise if the input is a vector. You can use it for vector too to get string.\nThe Matlab function fliplr (flipped version of flipud) does exactly what it says (swapping the dimensions of its argument). FILP is a Matlab function defined by:.\nThe function xlogn is the one to use in MATLAB as discussed in the comments. If you're working with C and C++, you'll use exp2 to get the exponential function. The 2 will change if you're working with a different base, but other ways to express the function exist in those languages. So, if you're using C or C++, make sure to use exp2 and not the regular exp.\nMatlab program for converting a 2D matrix to a cell array of strings containing elements in different rows. import matlab. Matrix A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 5 7 8] In this above statement it is taking in input a matrix A as an argument and returning a 3D Matrix which consists of 3.\nConvert string arguments to matlab variables by @(x,f,g) x; % converts all arguments to variables x,f,g. % @(y,f) y+1; % converts a single argument to a variable % function can also be the result of a function call. @(x,y,z) str2double(char(x+y+z)) % converts a string to a double variable. @(x, f) str2double(f(x)) % converts a function and a. The number of strings is given by length (c). So, the first row in c will contain the strings, while the second contains the length of strings in those rows. % Note: length (c) = [3 1 5]. % Function to return the sum of each row of c.

Here then, the function name returns a character vector of 1 by 1 dimensions, the size of 5 integers. In the following section we will learn how to declare a function in Matlab.\nThe function returns an input-output string, which is shown in the editor. The current cursor is at the position where the call returned to the Matlab interpreter. That is, the cursor is at the location where the function is supposed to return to if called without arguments. Note: the function expects a vector with 4 columns.

For the function, you can replace the input string with an input number and it may give you a different value. So for this, you can pass an argument as a matlab program. I need to make the output value a float. To return float result as output, we can convert the cell.\nMatlab: Get name and value of the variables in function In the following code, I have defined 3 variables A,B,C and 2 string variables x and y.

In   the  1970s   object-oriented programming was further explored and defined as a design style in Simula.   With  the  invention  of  Smalltalk, a language based on Simula that included most of the ideas originally developed by the creators of that language, it became clear that object-oriented programming was a distinct programming style.\nObject-oriented programming provides a means of organizing programs and data into abstract data types, called objects. An object is an instance of a type, and can consist of any number of fields (also called variables, or attributes) that can store values of a specified type. A class describes an object type, including its fields and methods (also called functions, or operations).\nIn object-oriented programming, a single piece of code executes in a program, called a class. Objects are classes that are created from code that are instances. A class definition must be created before an object is created. An object may contain several properties (also known as attributes) such as a first name and last name, an email address, and a list of favorite movies. These properties compose an object's state. An object's state can change over time. An object's behavior is typically described by a set of methods, which are called during execution to complete the object's operations. Executing an object is called instantiation.\nIn object-oriented programming, functions may be written using object-oriented programming constructs or using the more traditional procedural programming constructs. Objects may be used to simplify the creation and use of common programming functions. Objects contain a set of state and behavior data (i.e., variables and functions) that is shared between multiple procedures or programs. Using object-oriented programming, large systems may be created by combining individual objects, similar to the way components are combined to create modules for hardware systems.", "num_tokens_generated": 478, "OGF": 0.11669921875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 10.696583032608032, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 105, "chunk_index": 4, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
