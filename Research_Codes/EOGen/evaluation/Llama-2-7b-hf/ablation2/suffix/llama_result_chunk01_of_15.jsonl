However, when looking at curves with CM byproducts we get more information. To see examples where the Galois representations of two abelian varieties of the same dimension are not isogenous. A new conjecture, Taniyama\u2013Shimura (T\u2013S) conjecture, connects both these problems as well. We have made available online a paper (see Acknowledgements for a complete list of funding sources) by John Voight on the Taniyama-Shimura classification of cubic and higher degree abelian surfaces. It can also be seen as a generalization of the Riemann hypothesis. If a rational elliptic curve is defined over $\\Bbb Z$, then it is a modular curve. One of the most interesting mathematical mysteries of the 20th century is the Taniyama-Shimura, which states that every elliptic curve is modular. (Taniyama\u2014Shimura \u2014Kiyota conjecture - TSK-conjecture). Let F be an elliptic curve defined over the rationals with an isomorphism of 12th roots of unity. The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was proved in 1994 by A. Diamond and W. Silverman. Taniyama-Shimura-Weil (TSW) conjecture 1.3.4. What are the Taniyama-Shimura conjectures on abelian varieties and modular forms? A second one is that for every elliptic curve there is a modular curve \u0393 \u21a6 S \u0393 for which the abelian surface S is isometric over \u211a to the elliptic curve \u0393 as defined over Q. A modular form is a holomorphic function on a certain modular domain. A modular curve is a complex algebraic curve of genus 1 with a group of translations acting on it. An explicit example is an elliptic curve whose Jacobian is isomorphic to the 21st Weil's modular curve. The Taniyama-Shimura conjectures (and the Riemann Hypothesis for abelian varieties) say that the Galois conjugacy classes are just one of several symmetries between these objects. For instance, the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture. To use RACER, read the introductory section and the example. A new conjecture, Taniyama\u2014Shimura (T\u2014S) conjecture, connects both these problems as well. 12:34 \u2026 In this way, a congruence as in Taniyama-Shimura conjecture has an arithmetic meaning and is a \u2026 One of the most fascinating problems in contemporary mathematics is de\ufb01ning the mathematical contents of number theory. As I mentioned, one of the most important unsolved problems in number theory is to study relations between number theory and moduli theory. This is a rather large collection of conjectures! A Taniyama conjecture (TC) is of the form $$X \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Y)$$ and is said to be of order t if t is a non-negative integer and $t \\neq 0$. It was made by Gao, Gross, and Zagier in [#1] . We study the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for special types of elliptic curves on finite, complex projective planes. 1 In the following, for a curve of genus g, with the notations as in \u00a71.2, we denote by Xg(q) the Jacobian of the curve and by Qg(r) the quadratic twist of the curve. 295 - 340) 2.1. There is no direct relation between the two. The fundamental theorem of modularity of elliptic curves is a special case of the most general result which is known as Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for elliptic curves, valid up to a suitable level of arithmetic analysis and rigidity. We study the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for special types of elliptic curves on finite, complex projective planes. Taniyama\u2014Shimura\u2014Weil conjecture and Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. TS1: The fundamental theorem of modularity of elliptic curves is a (p-adic) analogue of TS1. In 1873, Arthur Cayley showed that not-isogenic projective varieties of the same dimension may have isomorphic abelian Galois representations. There is an interesting connection between the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture and elliptic curves over an arbitrary number field, as observed by David R. Wiles. As a generalization of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture, the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture proposes a relationship between the Galois representations of the modular curves and elliptic curves. 978 Kazuya Kato et al. However, the exact nature of the isomorphism is quite subtle, but we shall see later that the isomorphism \u2026 (A simple example is the curve $x^2 +y^2 = z^3 + w^3$ which is $j$-invariant. 9 \u00b5s. When there's a modular group defined that can act trivially on an elliptic curve, I have a conjecture that it should have the standard Taniyama-Shimura structure. The most general versions of these conjectures, the Taniyama-Shimura Conjectures, are still unproved. And it states something stronger about the curve. I want to share what I have found so far. The Taniyama\u2013Shimura problem states that every elliptic curve gives rise to a modular curve such that their isomorphism classes are \u2026 Since that paper the problem with the arithmeticity in (3) was completely resolved by the work of Wiles and Taylor and Warner who found a modular form having the Taniyama-Shimura period for \u2026 So why not start with them. If one tries to understand the relation between numbers and moduli, the most obvious place to look is the modular group (which is a subgroup in the general linear group ). They appear to have arisen out of the study of elliptic curves \u2026 I've made a wiki page on this topic. Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture on Curve Equation This is a generalization of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture to an analytic geometry. A Taniyama conjecture (TC) is of the form $$X \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Y)$$ and is said to be of order t if t is a non-negative integer and $t \\neq 0$. Let us define a Taniyama conjecture in terms of the arithmetic group action on the modulus: TC(X) :X\u2208Aut(Y) such that for all j>0, there exists a point y \u2208 Y such that for every g \u2208 G, X(y) = yg. What are 1.1. Introduction. (12) In any case, it is more likely that the Taniyama conjecture was proven (without explicitely knowing modular or j-invariance), than that Fermat\u2019s Theorem was proven after 350 years. I'm hoping to figure out the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture on elliptic curves over real quadratic fields in light of the work of Tunnell. 0:07:49 what is the taniyama shimura conjecture 0:10:06 Modular Forms Representative of TS conjecture 0:10:57 TS conjecture for elliptic curve over \u21242 - elliptic curve over \u21242 is isogenous to abelian surface over \u211a 0:16:40 TS conjecture for elliptic curve over \u2124 - 2 0:20:01 TS \u2026 The Taniyama- Shimura Conjecture states that given any number field, there is a modular curve that, as a general element of, has a unique point of order 3, which is the same as the complex elliptic curve (either defined over or isomorphic to) the number field. This is a mathematical claim asserting that the elliptic curve $$ E : \\mathfrak {C} \\left[ z \\right] \\ni \\varphi \\quad \\mapsto \\quad \\varphi ^{\\ast } : \\mathfrak {C} \\left[ z \\right] \\to \\mathfrak {C} \\left[ z \\right] $$ This follows as the Galois conjugation action on $E$ is isomorphic to a Galois representation on $E_{ab}$, and $\\varphi^{\\ast \u2026 This led to the development of the whole theory of modular symbols and modular forms. The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture states that there is a special relationship between elliptic curves and modular arithmetic. In 1994, a breakthrough was made in establishing the Taniyama--Shimura conjecture by Diamond and Silverman (for elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$). For each prime p there is a modular curve, Yp, which has an automorphism group generated by a Hecke operator of order p. The isomorphism class of Yp depends on which particular prime Hecke operator is considered. Taniyama-Shimura conjecture states: Every elliptic curve is modular. It involves Galois representations in certain algebraic geometry categories. Modular Curves and Abelian Varieties. TS2: The fundamental theorem of modularity of abelian varieties is a (p-adic) analogue of TS2, and TS3. Let\u2019s be a little bit precise. We explain, and justify, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture stated in the introduction. For the Taniyama-Shimura problem as formulated there is an interesting relationship with the following problem in number theory. Taniyama-Shimura conjectures. I am in the process of trying to understand the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.\nEggless Chocolate Cream Cake, 1 To 50 Number In Tamil, Ginger Pound Cake, Jain University Jobs, How To Make Cinnamon Milk, Tofu Egg Rolls Wrappers, Canon 3000d Price In Snapdeal, How To Grow A Gardenia In A Planter,\nThe Taniyama Shimura conjecture states that : 2. If this is the case, then we get a much better understanding of the \"modulus\" associated to an elliptic curve. It is closely related to the famous Taniyama--Shimura conjecture. (7.13) states an analogy between the Taniyama\u2013Shimura Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves, which has a modular counterpart. If we start working for curves of genus 2, then we are closer to the congruence we want, for some particular values of the modular invariance parameters. Theorem 5.1.2. There are many open problems. Taniyama-Shimura conjecture states: Every elliptic curve is modular. Then the TS conjecture states that $y^n = \\gamma$. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture can be stated as follows: Let $K/k$ be an Galois extension of number fields such that $K^{\\mathrm{ab}}\\subset k^{\\mathrm{ab}}$, and let $\\sigma:K\\to k$ be a generically finite morphism such that the ramification indices of the Galois group ${\\mathcal{G}}$ are given by the equation $j\\circ\\sigma={\\varrho}_p$, where ${\\varrho}_i$ is the $i$-th exponent of Frobenius for $K/k$. Theorem (Ahlgren, Deligne-Ribet, Diamond-Silverman): Suppose the elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by an equation of the form $y^2=xy^3+a_2x^3y+a_4x^4y^2+a_6x^6y^3+a_8x^8y^4;$ then, for all primes $p\\nmid 7192$, we have $N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}(p)=1$ iff $a_4$ is a square in $M_N(\\mathbb{Q})$, where $N=p-1$. (7.12) states a more special relationship between elliptic curves and modular curves than that discussed in the previous entry; we now recall the precise statement. (7.13) states an analogy between the Taniyama\u2013Shimura Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis for elliptic curves, which has a modular counterpart.. Introduction. Taniyama-Shimura conjecture states: Every elliptic curve is modular. I have tried to understand as best I can, but I feel it would be better if I started from scratch than attempting to understand it from other people's explanations. This is a mathematical claim asserting that the elliptic curve is isomorphic to modular curves, or elliptic modular curves. The TS conjecture states that $E_\\infty(x)$ has genus $0$ for all values of $k-1$ and is ramified at $k$ if and only if $p^g | 1$. We also explain how a new and rather intricate, but powerful, generalization of TS was developed by Diamond and Zagier, with \u2026\nEggless Chocolate Cream Cake, 1 To 50 Number In Tamil, Ginger Pound Cake, Jain University Jobs, How To Make Cinnamon Milk, Tofu Egg Rolls Wrappers, Canon 3000d Price In Snapdeal, How To Grow A Gardenia In A Planter,", "num_tokens_generated": 3112, "OGF": 0.759765625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 75.66841983795166, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 59, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

By definition, positive definite matrices are symmetric and have unit norm positive eigenvalues. In the next section we are going to give some elementary properties of positive definite matrices.\nIt means, in the end of this section, you will know all elements related to the important properties of positive definite matrices which may help you further in different exercises/problems/questions related to matrices that you will face in the later stages of your academic journey and also you will find these properties again and again in your future professional life. It is worth to be mentioned is the concept of the positive definite matrix is not new and was first introduced in [1]. Some books on matrix analysis also provide these details as well as some other details which you may find later on in these chapters.\nA matrix is a positive definite matrix if all its eigenvalues are positive. For a square matrix, the positive definite matrix, this condition reduces to have all the eigenvalues with same sign i.e., positive. So, the matrix , is.\nA matrix is diagonally dominant matrix if all the non-diagonal parts of the matrix, i.e, , are smaller than the diagonal part: If is a positive diagonal matrix, then we say it is positive definite.\nLet be a -by -matrix of order. Let and be non-negative integers. The matrix is said to be of order and is said to be of order, if are elements of some non-negative real numbers.\nIf any matrix is of orderand is of order, then is said to be of orderand is said to be of order. Matrix of order can be written as A matrix is said to be strictly diagonally dominant if any diagonal matrix in the upper or lower triangular matrix is positive definite.\nIn general, a matrix is said to be strictly diagonally dominant if there is no matrix in the upper or lower triangular matrix whose diagonal part is negative definite. Let be a square matrix of order. Let and be non-negative integers. The matrix is said to be positive definite if all principal minors are positive. More importantly every principal minor of is positive.\nLet and be non-negative integers. The matrix is said to be strictly positive definite if all principal minors are positive and there is no principal minor of which is negative. More importantly, every principal minor of is positive.\nIf any matrix is square and positive definite we can write the matrix as. We do not have enough knowledge about the eigenvalues of a matrix. Instead, we find out the value of the determinant. A positive definite matrix with all diagonal entries equal to is a diagonal matrix.\nIn general, a matrix is square and positive definite iff it is diagonal. Hence, a diagonal matrix is a special case of a positive definite matrix. If a matrix is given, we can find its diagonal matrix by applying the following transformation.\nWe will give some examples and solutions next. It is worth mentioning here that a matrix can remain diagonal matrix after transposing it.\nFor example, matrix can be written as.\nExample 1. Verify that is positive definite.\nSolution. The matrix is positive definite. It follows that all the principal minors of matrix are positive.\nExample 2. Verify that is strictly diagonally dominant matrix.\nSolution. The matrix is strictly diagonally dominant matrix. To prove strict diagonal dominance of a matrix is only sufficient to prove all principal minors of the matrix are positive.\nExample 3. Verify that is a strictly diagonally dominant matrix.\nSolution. If a matrix is strictly diagonally dominant matrix, then it satisfies all the properties stated above, hence it is a diagonal matrix.\nExample 4. Verify that is strictly positive definite matrix.\nExample 5: Verify that is a strictly positive definite matrix.\nSolution: matrix can be written as.\nIf you want to refer to a matrix and you see its symbolic form, you will simply have to type it exactly (and not the transposed form as we have transpose and adjoint matrices). But, if you look for a number representation of a matrix (by using the dot product), you will get the transpose of the original matrix.\nNote that the diagonal elements of a transposed matrix are the non-element rows or columns of the original matrix. Therefore, the diagonal elements of the transposed image of are and respectively.\nFor , the transposed image of is. This explains the fact that the transposed image of a matrix contains only the transposed elements of the rows and columns of the original matrix. The order of elements in the transposed image of is different from the original matrix.\nNow, if we apply the definition of matrix, we get that, and.\nSimilarly, , and. From which we get that, and.\nHence, is strictly diagonal dominant.\nExercise 1: Verify whether the following matrices are positive definite or strictly diagonally dominant matrices. If they are strictly diagonally dominant, then find their eigenvalues.\nExercise 3. Let be a zero-upper triangular matrix. Verify that is a positive definite matrix. Find its eigenvalues.\nExercise 4. Let be a matrix of size . Explain why is a positive triangular matrix. Find its eigenvalues and principal minors.\nExercise 5. Let be a matrix of size .

Let be a real nonnegative matrix of size. Explain why is a strictly positive definite matrix. Find the eigenvalues.\nSolution: The matrix is a square matrix. The principal minors of it are. Therefore, the matrix is a strictly positive definite matrix. For example, and the matrix is a strictly positive definite matrix with real eigenvalues.\nExample 1. Find the eigenvalues of positive definite matrix.\nSolution: The eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix can be computed in many different ways. Let us try one with an example. The matrix has eigenvalues. Since , they must satisfy the relation. Therefore, since , the only eigenvalues of are 6, 2, , , and which are in accordance with the matrix we calculated.\nThe geometric application of characteristic roots and the matrix of eigenvalues\nLet be a square matrix. The characteristic polynomial of is\nwhere the sign of the exponent is the same as the sign of the characteristic roots, which can be expressed in the following way: if the matrix is a principal matrix, then it is positive definite or strictly diagonal dominant, respectively.\nIt is worth mentioning that if is diagonal, then is also diagonal. Then, the determinant does not remain as it is, it becomes nonnegative and is positive definite.\nExample 2. Find the roots of and calculate the matrix of eigenvalues of .\nSolution. The eigenvalues of positive definite matrix can be found using characteristics. We will not give here a full explanation of the meaning of the characteristic polynomial (if you wish, refer to [1] for a more complete explanation - especially chapter 2 for a complete explanation), but the main feature is that characteristic roots are those roots that lead to the non-negativity in the definition of definite positive matrix. Using the characteristic polynomial, we get\nIn order to find the characteristics of a matrix, we know that they are those roots that lead to the non-negativity of the characteristic polynomial. The only nonzero roots of are 2, 3 and 4. Because of the sign of the matrix, the characteristic root should be 2. This is seen in the table.\nDeterminant Matrices\nIn section and we have given the geometric meaning of the determinant of a 2\u00d72-matrix, which is the area of a parallelogram. Based on this definition, there might be a possibility of using determinant expressions to find the eigenvalues of a matrix. In some book, the relationship between the first order and the eigenvalue has been pointed out. A simple example is, the relationship between the determinant and the first-order derivatives. In this section, we will prove a similar relationship for the case of matrices of size.\nExample 3. Find the eigenvalues of and their corresponding eigenvalues of the vector of linear transformations .\nSolution. In order to solve this problem with eigenproblems, if we write the matrix given in the example as and , we need to calculate a linear transformation with matrices and . This means that we only have to find the matrix of the transformation corresponding to . The problem now reduces to finding a matrix which has exactly the same determinant as has. This can be done with a determinant of the form , where and have determinants and , respectively.\nIf we use the result of the determinant and the result of the determinant, and therefore we determine that the value of the determinant of the matrix we want to find is , which can be done with the help of Cram\u00e9r's rule and the known determinant of the matrix of the transformation.\nCram\u00e9r's Rule. If the determinant of a column matrix is a polynomial of a column vector , Cramer's rule gives a formula to calculate the determinants of the matrix associated with the linear transformation . The formula has the following form:\nThe matrix is called the matrix of the transformation. The inverse matrix of the matrix of the transformation is called the matrix of elementary transformations.\nExample 4. Find and for given by .\nThe matrix of the transformation is: .\nThe matrix of the corresponding elementary transformation is A = .\nThe determinant, Cramer's rule and finding an eigenvector\nThe following matrix is a matrix of elementary transformations: . If we apply this transformation and we get that\nIf ., then the matrix is not similar to and is negative definite matrix.\nIf , then the matrix has the same properties as the transformed matrix. This matrix is called a triangular matrix of the form defined in [1].\nExercise 8. Using the procedure of Example 4, find and for the transformation\nExercise 9. Find the determinant in matrix form of the matrix of the transformations.\nExercise 10. If the matrix is similar matrix, then what can you say about the determinant of the matrix of the transformation?\nExercise 11. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of with positive determinant.\nSolution: .\nA principal matrix is a square matrix of with eigenvalues . The principal minors of a principal matrix are the absolute values of the characteristic minors of the matrix.\nThe principal minors, or the characteristic minors, of a principal matrix are always positive real numbers.\nIf a principal matrix is strictly diagonally dominant, then its principal minors are positive real numbers.\nIf a principal matrix is positive definite and strictly diagonally dominant, then it is a diagonal matrix.\nIf a square matrix is a diagonal matrix, then it's a principal matrix.\nExample 5. Find the eigenvalues and characteristic polyno's of the matrix .\nA principal matrix of order is a square matrix, if every element of -order is 0 except for the elements of same order. For a principal matrix of order and we define the principal minors as those minors whose elements are equal to zero if the order is greater than one.\nPrincipal matrix of order is said to be diagonal, if all its elements are 0, except diagonal elements which are all equal to 1.\nIf a principal matrix of size is real symmetric, then it's a diagonal principal matrix of order .\nEvery real matrix of order has a real diagonal principal matrix called the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse.\nExample 6. The matrix is a principal matrix. Find its principal minors.\nExample 7. Let be a matrix of order . Find the principal minors as well as its characteristic polynomials.\nExample 8. Find the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse of the matrix\nCousin Picks: Let the entries of the matrix with indices and , respectively, be ,,, and with indices and , respectively. Then for all for i=1 to p, the entries of the matrix with entries and are the entries of the inverse matrix of .\nThe following definitions can be stated:\nIf is a square matrix with elements of order , then all its entries are nonnegative; hence is a positive definite matrix. (Remember) The entries of a matrix are the elements of the matrix, for example,\nIf the entries of the matrix are all equal to zero, then the matrix is a zero matrix. (Remember) If is a non-empty set of positive integers, then is a matrix. If , then is a matrix; and its entries are the elements in the same order as the integers in .\nExample 9. The matrix has nonzero entries. What is the determinant of the matrix? Calculate its inverse matrix .\nExample 10. Let be the matrix whose entries are where , for , and for . Calculate its:\nInverse matrix.\nExample 11. Let be the matrix , is the inverse of what is , and what is ? Calculate as well as determine the rank of the matrix in the example and of the inverse matrix .\nExample 12. Let be the matrix , is the inverse of what is , and what is ? Calculate the inverses of the matrix and the inverse matrix and the rank of them.\nExample 13. In Example 12, we have seen that the ranks of and can be found with the following code in Python. If we call the function, we will see that the rank of is equal to In Python, a matrix with values is also given to the determinant function directly without any matrices. This function works with the following syntax:\nIn the above code, is a real number and determ represents the determinant of the matrix whose elements are the real numbers:\nExample 14. For a matrix whose elements are and , calculate the following, and also determine the rank of and of\nExample 15. Let , , and . In which matrix we want to calculate the determinant and is the inverse of ?\nSolution : The matrix of the inverse matrix is\nIn other words, the matrix is the inverse of and the inverse of A\nExample 16. Which matrix do not follow the matrix multiplication rule?\nIn each of the following matrices, multiply the first matrix with the second one:\nThe first thing you will notice is that since the first matrix has an identity, the other three matrices have the same identity (for example, ). For every other product, the number of zeros doubles and the size of the matrix doubles to 2\u00d72 or 3\u00d73, or to 4\u00d74 if you multiply with . This is the matrix multiplication rule. It also explains why the matrices have the same identit.\nCousin picks: A square matrix is called a diagonal matrix, if it consists only of diagonal elements. In this case, is called the diagonal matrix.\nEvery diagonal matrix is a diagonal principal matrix if has the same order of the matrix.\nExample 17. which square matrix is a diagonal matrix and in which matrix the diagonal element is negative?\nSolution. is a diagonal matrix and a diagonal principal matrix because it has elements, while each of the other three matrices only consists of diagonal elements. The first and third matrices are diagonal and each has a negative diagonal element.\nEvery square matrix is called strictly diagonally dominant if it is symmetric and the element in a non-zero matrix is always strictly larger than the element diagonal of the same matrix.\nExample 18. Which of the following matrices are strictly diaagonal dominant and how to calculate the positive eigenvalues? Which matrices are strictly diagonal dominant?\nSolution. In the matrix only are strictly larger than , which makes it diagonal dominant but not strictly diagonal dominant as we can find the entry in the matrix. This is an example of a square matrix, not a principal matrix.\nExample 19. which of the following matrices are strictly diagonally dominant?\nExample 20. is the eigenvalues of strictly diagonal dominant matrix?\nSolution. is the eigenvalues , is the eigenvalues and is the eigenvalues\nExample 21. Which of the following matrices have strictly diagonally dominant entries?\nSolution. The second one and third one have strictly diagonally dominant entries as we see from the following\nExample 22. For the matrix given in Example 15, calculate .\nSolution. for the matrix given in the question, we can use the following python code to do it:\nExample 23. In Example 16, you have seen the multiplication of matrices. The following matrix is the transpose matrix of :\nYou can also multiply the third matrix with the first one as well:\nThe product of a matrix with the transpose of it is a diagonal matrix and vice versa. This is called the transpose of the matrix:\nExample 24. Compute :\nExample 25. Solve the following problem using Gaussian elimination.\nSolution. We start with :\nAfter we have completed the first step:\nWe can conclude from the last row, that it contains the same values as the first row, which means we can replace the first row with the diagonal :\nAfter one more step we have\nWe then replace the top right corner of the third row with the diagonal of the matrix:\nAfter a final step, we have:\nNow the right part is equal to the diagonal, therefore we can replace it now with\nThis gives us the results\nExample 26: For each of the following 2\u00d72 matrices, find .\nSolution. For both matrices and , we get the following results:\nExample 27: For each of the following 3\u00d72 matrices, find .\nSolution. For the first matrix, we get the following results:\nFor the second matrix, we get the following results:\nExample 28: Find the following eigen value problem with .\nSolution. We know that and , since is a diagonal matrix. Therefore, we can obtain the determinant and the matrix, using this matrix:\nNow, we can find a similar transformation like in Example 25.\nExample 29: Solve the following eigenvalue problem.\nSolution. We can find the eigenvalues, which are , respectively\nWe can find the diagonal matrix that gives these eigenvalues by using the transpose of :\nWe have .\nExample 30: In Example 29 we have used the matrix , which is a diagonal matrix in which every element is equal to 1. How can we obtain this diagonal matrix? What other diagonal matrices can we get?\nSolution. In order to obtain the , we must set every element to 1. This is done by following Python code:\nNow, let's look in a list, the values of the values and .\nExample 31:\nfor the value of .\nThis should work for every value.\nThe in the values of the value\nThen the value and\nThe next is the next. the values.\nThe next element values\nThe final list is the element\nIn Python, there is the final value,\nExample 4.4 is the is the\nin the value.

Find the best fitting word with the help of different algorithms. In this post, we'll learn about the stacks and queues in detail, and then we will learn about how we can create our own stacks and queues program in python. stack is a recursive data structure which uses two pointer to store the data, first one is used to store the last element of the stack and second one is used to store the current element of the stack. We are familiar with the use of a double pointer for the first element of a linked list. It also supports insertion, deletion and traversal. What are the benefits of using the queue method in Java? A queue is a simple data structure that can be used for storing and accessing elements. Introduction to Queue 2. Stack and Queue are both part of the abstract data type stack which provides a way to store the data in memory in specific order. To implement a Queue in C, first, we\u2019ll create a data type to denote a Queue. The insertion and search operations in a queue are faster than stack. A queue which has both insertion and deletion in O(1) time is called a _____. When the enqueue operation has been invoked, it returns the value of size. stack and queues: a stack is an ordered collection of objects that grow/shrink, while a queue is a collection of objects that grow/shrink; a stack is made up of nodes, where each node holds an object plus one reference to a predecessor. I. Stack: It holds the items which are inserted and are accessed using their values. It should be noted that in each language, you need to use different APIs. It doesn't matter whether you have chosen Stack or Queue (the order in which you pop elements from the structure is irrelevant), but you must choose one implementation or another, otherwise the program will not work. Here, we know that Queue is sequence data structure and it is a linear structure. Also, in this case, the queue is of a simple type that uses simple arrays. In order to enqueue an item. In C++, we can implement Queue using two array or linked list (depending upon the application requirement) \u2013 1. Also, we can not print the elements in reverse order. Example of stack is using it as a queued for process. The queue data structure is used to store and retrieve sequential data efficiently. A linked list in C is very straightforward to implement. We can think of this type of queue as a collection of characters that are waiting in a line to be processed. 6. In this data structure, data can also be retrieved in insertion order. Queue can be implemented using two pointer and two stacks. A Queue, on the other hand, is an ordered collection of data where elements are added but removed in the reverse order. A Queue is an ordered collection of data items where they are added to the end of queue in order. In the below python implementation, we are going to use both array and linked lists to implement queues. Python Stacks and queues are a concept that allows the creation of FIFO(first in, first out) data structures based on how to the data structure works. For e.g. Let\u2019s discuss the working of a Queue. This course includes both array and linked list implementation for Queues, in both C and C++, making the course more useful. What do you have to implement to get an iterator for a Queue? 2) To implement them both as dynamic queues. This data structure is made up of a list of items. In the first one, we will use two stacks for implementing queue data structure in C++. A queue can also be implemented by using two stacks. It holds the items in a particular order, that is first inserted element is taken out first. In our case, we have a two-stack queue. Queue is also a sequential collection of elements stored in a line. Here, we have used two stacks to store the elements in the queue. To implement a simple queue in C++, we must create a data structure to keep track of the queues\u2019 index and size. To store items in queue, we can use any container like List, Stack or Queue. Here we have used doubly-linked list to implement the queue. We can also have more than two queues. The working of a queue can be visualized as a circle. The enqueue operation is used to add an element to the queue. Example of Queue is used in many applications like TCP/IP protocol. Each node can represent an entire data structure. C # Program to implement Stack and Queues. For this, we'll use the concept of a linked list. Stack: It is also known as LIFO (Last In First Out). What is the difference between \u201cin-place\u201d algorithm and \u201cinterview\u201d algorithm for finding the minimum element in a linked list? If you found this article useful, please share with others! 3) To implement them based on a first-in first-out ordering scheme. In this article, we will implement an efficient queue data structure in C and C++ programming languages. An alternative implementation of the queue data structure in C++. What is the best way to implement a queue to improve the performance of Python programs? Here, two stacks will be defined in which, we can perform different operations on the queue data structure. A queue is a data structure which serves as an ordered collection of data elements in which insertion and deletion of elements is performed at one end only. This course includes both array and linked list implementation for Queues, in both C and C++, making the course more useful. A queue is a data structure that implements the FIFO concept. When the pop operation has been invoked, it returns the value of a. In this blog post, you will discover how the queue data structure can be implemented in C, C++, and Java. An array-based implementation of the queue in C++ programming language. Here is how you can implement a queue data structure in Python: For an array-based implementation, we\u2019ll need four variables: Here are the operations I mentioned for the two queues when we were talking about the array implementation: As for the linked list implementation, here are the operations available in Python: You may have other operations as well! Queues are typically implemented by one or more linked lists. Here\u2019s more on the differences between stacks and queues: Now that we know that these data structures are different, it\u2019s time to learn how to implement them. As the name implies, an array-based queue is implemented as an array. Queues are typically implemented as arrays of pointers to the structures. Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis and Design, Solution of Problems Using Data Structures and Algorithms. If we want to use C library, then instead of using array we can create a linked list. The enqueue operation is used to add an element to the queue. In C, for an array-based queue, you can use a queue data type: The second operation to implement is the dequeue operation. In both C and Python, the operations available differ: Python supports operations such as enqueue and dequeue. For a Java implementation, however, you can use the Arrays.asList() and Arrays.copyOf() method as part of its utility class: As you\u2019ve seen, a queue is a collection of items that support an insertion interface. Queue Data Structure 2. The queue and stack are some of the most basic data structures used by programs. The operations to perform in a queue are same as to push and to pop. You can use a queue data type to insert and get data from the queue. 3. Also, we can not remove the element if the element is already removed. Let\u2019s see the implementation of a linked list queue. What is the Queue Data Structure? The main advantage of implementing queues using arrays is that you can directly access elements from indexes in the array. In this course, we will go over several queue implementations in the following languages: So, what are queues? We can then use the dequeue operation to retrieve the element. A linked list, though, can be implemented as a queue in Python \u2013 just connect the nodes together. Queue data structure in C++ implementation #include 1 //Inheritance 2 class Queue{ 3 public: 4 void enque(int value); 5 int dequeue(void); 6 }; 7 int main(){ 8 int value; 9 Queue queue; 10 queue.enque(value); 11 cout<<queue.dequeue(); 12 return 0; 13 } 14. This article is a continuation of the previous article on the Stack data structure.It follows that before reading this article, you should have a working understanding of the Stack data structure.. As you might recall, the Stack data structure is a recursive data structure which has two operations (push and pop). Queues are linear data structures, which means a queue is capable of storing a list of elements only in a linear sequence. I know a little about both topics, and what I understand is that both data structures allow for insertion and removal of elements from a sequence. It uses a linked list with circular rings as nodes linked together to form a chain. Queues are also sometimes called FIFO (First in, First out). A queue is a linear data structure in data structures such as Stack, LIFO (Last In First Out), or FIFO (First in First out). These two data structures allow to insert and remove elements in a given sequence, while being able to retrieve elements from either end. Let\u2019s take a look at a simple queue implementation, based on two stacks. As we can see, the array-based queue supports faster insertion and deletion. What are C++ vector queues? The operations to perform in a queue are same as to push and to pop. The data type of Linked list queue is also of type Queue because we are using the same array to store the queue. This course covers the implementation of queue and stack in an array with and without a linked list implementation. Please note that queues are two-ended, which means they don\u2019t have a first end nor a last end. Queue in c is a linear data structure. A good C programming reference book for this is C Programming: A Modern Approach by K. N. King. The dequeue operation is used to fetch the topmost element from the queue. The implementation of these data structures in C++ and Java can be found at the end of this article. To add an element to the back of the queue, we invoke the push operation of the queue. What are Array-based Implementations? Implementation of Queue in C Programming Language using Stacks and without using Stacks. This article walks you through a couple of ways to implement a queue data structure, and how other options might influence the implementation. Here I share a cpp source code to implement the implementation of the queue in cpp. They are called array-based implementations as they take advantage of the fact that arrays are used by languages such as C or C++ to store lists. Queue Python Implementation. But we can not delete the first element from the queue. As a result, the next insertion is placed in the next available slot which is vacated by the previous insertion. Here is a list of differences between the C-style array-based queue and the C++-style array-based queue: The C-style queue has its operations declared in the Queue.h file. Queue: Queue is also a linear data structure. So, we\u2019ll use two queues. A queue is a linear data structure, which means it can hold only a series of elements, and you can insert items and extract them from it. A queue can be implemented using a stack, list or an array. Enqueue- Add Item to Queue. In this post, we\u2019ll dive into what queues are, and how they\u2019re implemented in Python. This data type is often used as part of the standard library in several languages. C Program to Implement Stack and Queues A stack is a queue in which the last item inserted is the first one to be retrieved. In Python, since an array does not implement FIFO, it's more natural to use a list of index values to implement a queue. 2. 4) To implement both data structures. Since Python collections are ordered objects, we can have a queue made of any sequence implementing the __reversed__() protocol (see below). This tutorial attempts to introduce the reader with the basics of the queues in C programming. The dequeue operation is used to retrieve an element from the front of the linked list. Queue is also a linear data structure. The only difference between a queue and a stack is that a stack maintains a LIFO order. One of the advantages of using arrays is that we can insert as many elements as we want. So, they\u2019re not suitable when we have a fixed size, or the size of the queue is limited by the index. Here, we\u2019re adding a value and a list of values. This data type, called \u201cqueue\u201d in most languages, allows us to store data in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner, which means that the items we insert are the most recent items to be retrieved. 2. Queue data structure in C++ implementation #include 1 //Inheritance 2 class Queue{ 3 public: 4 void enque(int value); 5 int dequeue(void); 6 }; 7 int main(){ 8 int value; 9 Queue queue; 10 queue.enque(value); 11 cout<<queue.dequeue(); 12 return 0; 13 } 14. Queue: Queue is a linear data structure in which, we can add an element to it and at a time can only remove one element. We know that queues are called as linear data structure as we can easily push or pop the elements at the front and rear respectively. It also demonstrates the use of a queue using the C# collections. Please use one of Go/Matlab/Java to solve the question: Implement a queue data structure using two stacks. The queue has become an essential part of modern software design. Queue - Stack - Queues. So, a queue data type can be used to implement a queue data structure \u2013 it has all the methods required to perform the operations, and it\u2019s also possible to implement additional operations, such as checking the size of the queue or checking what\u2019s been put in the queue, with a quick search of the elements in it. This can make queue implementations very fast compared to when using linked lists. The enqueue operation is used to add an element to the queue. We'll first cover array-based queues, in which elements are stored in an array. What is an array-based queue implementation in C++ and Java? An array-based queue is faster than a linked list, because we can access (and remove and add elements) much faster in an array than in a list. A linked list implementation for the Python queue. The dequeue operation is used to retrieve the top element from the queue. The enqueue function is used to add an element to the queue. Queues are data structures for which adding and removing an element to the end of the queue happens in a certain order, which is first in, first out. This is the C++ implementation of Queue using two Stacks. Array-based implementations. Linked List Implementation. 5) To implement them as FIFO. Here\u2019s a queue that uses an array of integers as the data type. In C++, we can implement Queue using two array or linked list (depending upon the application requirement) \u2013 1. It's used to organize things in a linear fashion. But we can use two stacks because the elements are removed from the front and put to the back of the queue. Queue data structure in C++ implementation #include 1 //Inheritance 2 class Queue{ 3 public: 4 void enque(int value); 5 int dequeue(void); 6 }; 7 int main(){ 8 int value; 9 Queue queue; 10 queue.enque(value); 11 cout<<queue.dequeue(); 12 return 0; 13 } 14. It is called as Stack as we can only push items to it. The enqueue operation adds an element to the queue. Then we will learn to use C++ vectors to implement queues. So, now let us discuss about Queue Implementation using 2 Different Stack \u2013 Here You will see both approaches to Queue implementation via Stack. This data type, called \u201cqueue\u201d in most languages, allows us to store data in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner, which means that the items we insert are the most recent items to be retrieved. A queue is a linear data structure. In the article titled Array-Based Queue Implementation in C++, we have used two 2-dimensional arrays each of length equal to the number of elements in the queue. There\u2019s a different data type used for each language (C++ has an Queue and Python has an Queue), and you can find its documentation by searching for the name of the data type in the documentation of that library. A queue is a linear data structure. Queues can also be implemented using an array to store the queue elements. Queues can also be implemented using an array to store the queue elements. The enqueue operation is used to add an element to the end of our queue. This data type is often used as part of the standard library in several languages. Queues are more suitable than stacks when our queue has a limited number of elements. The dequeue implementation is a good example of a C++ queue: Here, the queue elements are stored in a linked list. The implementation can be further optimized by using a double linked list. A C program to implement the queue using two stacks. The linked list also ensures that the dequeue operation will be faster because we won\u2019t keep any information about the queue elements (since we have the index associated with the queue elements), making it faster to access the elements in the Linked list. Queue and Stack in C++ The queue is a linear data structure where the last item in inserted is the first one to be deleted. Also, when you want to retrieve the element in the queue, you need to pass a parameter of type Node, as well as an index of the element in the queue. Here the two functions are enqueue and dequeue . These two data structures allow to insert and remove elements in a given sequence , while being able to retrieve elements from either end. In order to enqueue an item. 2. To push the elements to the queue, you have to use the enqueue function of the Queue. Please note that queues are two-ended, which means they don\u2019t have a first end nor\u2026 There\u2019s a different data type used for each language (C++ has an Queue and Python has an Queue), and you can find its documentation by searching for the name of the data type in the documentation of that library. In C++, when we say, it returns the topmost element of the array-based queue, that as. To push and pop operations for the of array-based array can we put in-based pop the of the array-based to of the the array-based using a elements, we the array-based use will use are as using an array implementations and operations. A queue, we data you in an data used can do, the C-based algorithms, in Python implementation: data structure of an data structures, in the the and dequeue is a very data in data structures are also be retrieved, in, an queue a queue, queue and, using a array of the we can dequeue element, these queues from and implement and arrays as part, and queue data in two stacks can be and dequeue for the a queue, queue we, implementation: Queue data store a stack, are and queue\u2026 In both simple operations. Queue is data a linked lists 191. In C 2. A queue implemented a queue in Python data structures (first element from the, you the queue, a Python in your algorithm, C#queue C Programming in the queue, queue data is a C code, queue of elements that are of que, and how the data types of implementation in a queue data is, you want to implement and how we use of queue in a queue by queue, and the, a a queue. The data structure of the first C-like how you can use the and how you, a very useful queue implementation. Here we use linked in queues. C queue for a queue data structure. This post insertion and the insertion. As part of the data queue, we've used in C language. You want in the first data, the elements from the stack and a queue, the use the queue structure is the data structures. 10.

C# supports a LINQ extension method QuickSort<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source) that sorts the input in place.\nThe code is rather simple and can be implemented in one line in C#:\nsource.Sort(QuickSort<int>());\nThe result is also immediate:\nint result = source[0];\nNotice that in C# the value comparison is done on equality of objects (not of values as in Java and C++). However, QuickSort is not suitable for lists without any comparison method and it should be used with LINQ only when this is not an issue.\nQuicksort in C++\nQuicksort is very common sorting algorithm that is not only the easiest to implement from scratch, but also performs faster than most other sorting algorithms. This article will introduce C++ standard library std::sort template function that implements quicksort in a portable way.\nSorting algorithms consist of several common operations:\nCreating initial array order. There is no point in sorting an already sorted array.\nDivide. In our case, we will try to divide array into as many parts as possible to guarantee that sorting each subsequent part will take linear time.\nConquer. Now each subpart will be sorted independently and after completing the whole array we will merge them back into one, sorted array.\nBefore showing code, let's try to demonstrate how quicksort is done in C++ in one step. We assume that input is an array arr of type T.\nThe quicksort algorithm\nChoose pivot (it is usually the first or the last element, but can be picked arbitrarily):\narr[i] <= arr[j]   # i < j\nThe original array, arr, contains 30 elements and the comparison just created two sorted chunks of 2 elements:\nWe now split the current array in half and sort each part separately:\narr[low..(i - 1)] <= arr[i]\narr[i..(j + 1)] <= arr[i]\nEach of these two sorted chunks contains only 1 element, but we can make sure that the other element belongs to the first chunk:\narr[i..j] <= arr[i]\nWhen we complete both chunks, we can merge them back together and we are done:\narr[low..j] <= arr[i] for k in low..j\narr[j..j] <= arr[i]\narr[j..high] <= arr[i]\nThis looks as if we have figured out one step of quicksort. And indeed, we already have it. You can implement this algorithm in a couple of lines or call std::sort as explained in the next section.\nCalling std::sort\nC++ Standard Library provides an API for quicksort. This API has been there for a while, but used to be hard to use in early versions of C++ Standard Library. The good news is that it is now much easier to use and, better, the STL is now widely supported even on compilers that do not define the library at all.\nQuicksort template is implemented as a free, non-member template std::sort. It takes two parameters in its template and accepts as many arguments as you like in the two arguments.\nstd::sort(args1)\nstd::sort(args1,args2)\nstd::sort(args1,args2,args3)\nstd::sort(args1,args2,args3,args4)\nQuicksort template, although non-trivial to use, is in a way quite simple because it has only one function parameter \u2013 predicate. Predicate is responsible for comparing two elements in the original array. By the way, one of the earliest standard implementations had an optional second parameter that was called key and worked much like a lambda function or a function pointer. This parameter is still supported, but is seldom used. In the second iteration of C++ Standard Library, many predicates and other algorithms were moved from algorithm header to standard header, thus making their use much easier. You can create an arbitrary predicates using bind.\nIf you decide to implement quicksort into your program, the most convenient approach is to write a struct with a predicates and a custom comparison function:\nstruct QuickSortFunctor\nint compare (const T&left, const T&right) const\nreturn pred(left,right);\nTo use std::sort implementation, you do not even need to create a predicate to be able to use it. The C++ Standard Library automatically provides a default comparison predicate and, if necessary, you can change it using bind::ref functor parameter. For example, if your arrays have a specific ordering, you can write:\nstd::sort(input.begin(),input.end(),\nbind::ref(less<T>()));\nif you do not need anything of the elements that are sorted, you can even pass an input as:\nbind::ref(less<T>()).execute()\nC++ Standard Library provides also another free template function, sort, which, although is slightly faster, comes at the cost of additional template parameter.\ntemplate <class Policy>\nvoid sort(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,\nPolicy comp = equal_to<InputIterator>())\nYou can provide your own implementation of Compare or use the supplied Compare.\nCalling sort(Compare &) without a predicates is an undefined behavior. For example, passing an array to sort without the predicates will probably take forever.\nCompanies that use C++\nAs we can see from the table below, only companies from two regions of the world, Western Europe and North America, took it. All others either didn't try or didn't find any advantages to using C++ over other languages.\nWhat is C++ and how it works?\nC++ is a programming language, which is an abbreviation for \u00abcompiled\u00bb or \u00abinterpreted\u00bb. Although its name is \u00abC++\u00bb, it's not a pure superset of C: C++ has some of characteristics which make it closer to Ada than to C. First of all - it has a very strong orientation to object-oriented programming ideas and design. Some people regard C++ as a separate language, which is the object-oriented version of C (OO-C). Since C++11 it has full support of lambda functions, a lot of them came from Scala and Python languages.\nThese days, the C++ is not a programming language for programmers with very low skills. In C/C++ you should know some math (complex numbers, matrices, vectors, integration), know how computer works (memory model, pointers), what is multithreading and what are threads, filehandles and process, etc. With C++, you can get into the depths of computer science.\nIt is not possible to compare C / C ++ with other modern programming languages in terms of productivity. Compared with them C / C ++ is much more difficult and painful. On the other hand, C / C ++ gives a lot of opportunities for implementing and improving code, which are generally only available to mathematicians and theoretical physicists. Let's talk about productivity in a specific task and consider the code of the \"Crossword solver\" crossword generator.\nThe goal of the generator is to read the problem as a set of ordered pairs (one from x, y) and generate the corresponding crossword.\nvoid fillGrid (XYGrid<T>&, Vector_<vector<Direction>> const aDirectionVector) {\nint x, y; XYGrid<T>::GetXY(x, y);\nfillCell(x, y, aDirectionVector);\nvoid fillCell (int x, int y, Vector_< vector <Direction> > const aDirectionVector) {\nint delta, direction;\ndirection = *aDirectionVector[x].Get();\n// Generate numbers, directions, numbers and check them (within a loop)\nif (direction >= X_MAX)\nif (direction == DIR_LEFT || direction == DIR_RIGHT)\nif (x + delta >= 0 && x + delta < X_MAX)\nif (delta >= 0 && delta < X_MAX)\nif (fillGrid(grid,aDirectionVector)) // generate numbers in the direction and check them\nif (*aDirectionVector[x].Get() == DIR_LEFT || X_MAX <= x + delta) {\nif (x + delta == X_MAX)\nif (fillGrid(grid,aDirectionVector)) // generate numbers in the direction and check them..\nThe program works as below:\nRead the input data and construct a Vector_ of directions where each entry looks like this: [DIR_UP, DIR_RIGHT, DIR_DOWN, ...]\nGo through all possible starting points of all possible directions. At this stage the program is looking for numbers to replace directions if they lead nowhere.\nCreate a new number vector (which we call numbers) on the basis of each previous iteration for possible next directions. For example, we determine that DIR_UP leads nowhere, then the next possible direction is DIR_RIGHT.\nCreate a vector of directions in a new number and repeat the process: go through all possible starting points of all directions. If both vectors intersect in one cell and, then, we store numbers in the intersection of these vectors.\nAfter filling the grid, you can go to the next problem.\nWhat did we gain?\nThe amount of numbers in the solution is O(p1*p2).\nThe amount of directions that leads to a dead end is O(p1) and the number of crosswords generated is O(p1*p2), which is better than O(p1*p2), the amount of crosswords generated by the solution based on one vector. So we can say that the code is almost perfect. And so the question arises, is it not possible to improve it?\nLet's improve this example:\nif (delta >= 0 && delta < X_MAX) {\nif (*aDirectionVector.Get()(x) == DIR_LEFT || X_MAX <= x + delta) {\nif (*aDirectionVector.Get()(x) == DIR_LEFT || x + delta == X_MAX)\nThis code is more terse, but still we get O(p1*p2). So, we have achieved the goal of optimizing the code, increasing its compression ratio, but we have not changed the amount of numbers in the solution. There is a lot of unused space. That is, we need better sorting solutions. In search it turned out that the most compact solution belongs to the quicksort algorithm.\nThe idea of quicksort is simple enough. We create a pivot and divide all data points into two, in one way or another divided in half. Let's draw a diagram for a single iteration of quicksort:\nDivide the data into two parts, but also into 2 subparts.\nCombine the first two half points to sort them and again sort the remaining half.\nThis process is called quicksort. At the output, the result will be the smallest number of elements and in them the elements will be sorted in increasing order. If we return to the task of solving crossword puzzles using a standard sort, we get the following solution:\nif (direction == DIR_LEFT || direction == DIR_RIGHT)\nif (x + delta == X_MAX) {\nif (fillGrid(grid,aDirectionVector[x])) {\nWhat's the problem with the first version?\nIf you compare the first version of the \"Crossword solver\" crossword generator and the second one, the amount of vectors used remains the same. The algorithm and the amount of numbers are not changed, and so is the amount of crosswords generated. All that remains is to generate vectors and fill the grid with numbers.\nWhat is the effect of adding the quicksort to the vector-based implementation? There is a difference.\nAs a result, we got an algorithm that is both shorter and faster. If we apply this algorithm to the generator task, we get an algorithm with higher productivity.\nWe can call the result a code-generation tool. It can simplify the task of solving crossword puzzles, it can take care of some work and replace part of it with code.\nWhen to use the quicksort?\nWhen solving crossword puzzles, we do not need any mathematical knowledge. C / C ++ allows you to solve and solve complex mathematical problems with relative ease. In C / C ++ there is little need for complex types of abstraction. This is another side of the language. In addition to solving complex mathematical problems with relative ease, when using C / C ++ we can write code faster than we could if using another language.\nIf you want to try to solve large data and find optimal solutions that involve a division of data, sorting, vector operations, etc., then the choice is clear. The choice would be quicksort.\nC++ is one of the leading programming languages with a great history of improvements. C++ still remains true to its name, which says a lot about complexity. There are languages whose main advantage is simplicity, they allow creating a project with minimal effort and for a short time. In contrast, C++ is designed for professionals. It has a large functionality at each stage of development. The code is often very dense and can hide many bugs. C++ requires thorough attention to memory management and concurrency.\nThe language is best suited for the development of small embedded systems in such programming languages as C# or Swift, with a modular design, high performance, and a compact memory use. Here are some of the examples that show exactly why C++ development is so difficult:\nIt often requires a larger memory footprint.\nLess suitable for cross-platform.\nIt is necessary to use a compiler.\nDevelopment takes more time.\nLack of features.\nHigh level of learning required.", "num_tokens_generated": 3253, "OGF": 0.794189453125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 80.20126247406006, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 1, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", "run_seed": 65, "chunk_index": 1, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
