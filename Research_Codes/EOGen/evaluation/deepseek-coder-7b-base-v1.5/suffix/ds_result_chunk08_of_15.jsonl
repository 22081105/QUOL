In nutrientOPTnotation", "generated_output": ", we will explore how these concepts can be utilized to create top-notch software. So, let\u2019s dive in!\nI\u2019ll be posting the full blog on DEV community.\nThe DEV Post: \u2014 https://dev.to/nutrientopt/nutrient-app-development-with-react-js-best-practices-3pdi\n\n## How to Build an E-Commerce Website with ReactJS and Strapi in 5 Minutes?\n**5 mins read**\nIn this article, we will learn how to build an E-Commerce website with ReactJS and Strapi. You will be amazed by how quickly you can build this project!\nIn nutrientOPTnotation, we will work on a fully functional E-Commerce website. With ReactJS, we will be implementing a dynamic website. On the back-end, with Strapi, we will integrate with Stripe and a local JSON file.\nTo get started, I will provide you with all the tools you need to create our E-Commerce store with ReactJS and Strapi. You\u2019ll notice we\u2019re using the NPM package manager. This package manager is part of the Node.js ecosystem, which is widely used in the JavaScript community, especially in web development.\nIf you haven\u2019t used NPM before, it\u2019s best to check out their official website for more information. We are now ready to create our ReactJS and Strapi project.\nLet\u2019s begin, create a folder on your device and initialize a new Node.js project with the NPM init command. In the meantime, please check your NPM version by entering the command, \u201cnpm -v\u201d to be sure you have your NPM up to date.\nYou should see something similar to the following result:\nYou should see the version number displayed on your screen. You can continue if everything is installed, otherwise, see \u201cnpm\u201ds troubleshooting.\nOnce the setup is complete, you will need to use the \u2018npm install\u2019 command to get all the dependencies, libraries, and plugins we\u2019ll need.\n    npm install --save react react-dom yarn add strapi strapi-plugin-upload (local)\nIn the above command, we have added:\nReactJS: Our main frontend framework that will allow us to create our functional website with features needed.\nReact-dom: The ReactJS library that is essential for our web app.\nStrapi: It\u2019s an open-source Headless CMS framework for front-end developers.\nStrapi-plugin-upload: This plugin allows our store to have a static-generated website. Strapi will handle files and folders on the backend to store them. It includes image upload, manipulation, and optimization.\nIn addition to the above dependencies, we will also install an NPM package named bootstrap. It\u2019s a utility library that handles a lot of front-end web development tasks such as layout components and styling with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. We will be integrating bootstrap with ReactJS: \u2018bootstrap react\u2019 by using npm.\n    npm install --save bootstrap (npm) yarn add bootstrap (yarn)\n    (1,247817)\nIn the above code snippet, I have included bootstrap as a dependency for both NPM and Yarn package managers!\nNow run the command \u2018npm start\u2019 to start our project.\nOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should get a blank page that states: \u201cNothing to display.\u201d You are all set, now let\u2019s integrate our Strapi CMS onto our store!\nLet\u2019s create our Strapi project. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and then enter the commands below:\n    npm install -g strapi yarn global add strapi\nThis should install the strapi CLI which uses yarn to handle package dependencies. Let\u2019s initialize our store by running a few commands.\n    strapi new ecomm-store-backend (for local) yarn create strapi-app ecomm-store-backend (for yarn)\nIn the above command, \u2018ecomm-store-backend\u2019 is the name of the subfolder that stores all our store files. In the process, it will prompt you the following questions: \u2018Choose your installation type:\u2019. Choose \u2018Quickstart (recommended).\u2019 Let\u2019s also check out \u2018Choose the backend database.\u2019 We are using a Local JSON file as a database for this store.\nNow select the database name, we\u2019ll give our store the name \u2018ecomm-store-backend\u2019.\nThen it will prompt you to select the password for your Strapi account. Choose an 8 character + password and make sure to note it somewhere.\nIt will also ask you to define the host and port. Keep it as it is, and type \u2018Y\u2019 to accept all packages.\nFinally, it will be asking you to continue. Type \u2018y\u2019 for yes.\nNow navigate to the root directory and launch our store using the command strapi start.\nOpen http://localhost:1337/admin in our browser, and our admin panel will be visible.\nIn our admin panel, we will be creating our E-commerce store. In my example, I\u2019ll be focusing on three types of products: T-Shirt, Hats, and Hoodies. After creating the category, I will add product options in our store.\nSelect \u2018content type builder\u2019 in our admin panel and create your product types under \u2018collection type\u2019.\nFirst, let\u2019s create the Product collection type and create an image field for the file size and format for each product type. Then set our product\u2019s name and description.\nNow create the other three products types \u2013 for example, a hat has fewer properties than a t-shirt or a hoodie. The first product is an image, which is the product\u2019s main photo. We\u2019ll want to set the upload size and format as well.\nNow we\u2019ll create the other product options like color, price, and currency. After doing that, we will build our Strapi store and set the relations with reactstrap. Let\u2019s start with integrating ReactJS into our store.\nNavigate to http://localhost:3000 and select create-react-app.\nMake sure you are in the \u2018backend\u2019 folder.\nCreate the index.html for our store by running the below command: \u2018create-react-app ecomm-store\u2019.\nNavigate to your react package directory with the cd command.\nNext, navigate back to your terminal, and start your store with the command npm run start.\nIn the browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you\u2019ll see your newly created page.\nNext, create index.html with the command 'create-react-app ecomm-store.'\nIn the index.html file, use bootstrap with react to make our app dynamic.\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n      <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n      <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n      <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\">\n      <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"\">\n      <link rel=\"startupfavicon\">\n      <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akiran/react-slick@0.23.1/lib/react-slick.min.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akiran/react-slick@0.23.1/lib/index.min.css\" />\n      <%favicon, css/style.css, js/main.js%>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@1.8.1/slick/slick.css\"/>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@1.8.1/slick/slick-theme.css\"/>\n      <title>ecommerce-store</title>\n    <%react-bootstap.js, jquery.js, slick.min.js%>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <div id=\"root\"></div>\n    <%bootstrap.bundle.min.js, bootstrap.min.js, popper.min.js%>\n      <script src=\"<%root/index.js%>\"></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\nIn the above code, I have included the bootstrap code with jQuery, Popper js, and React Bootstrap. Furthermore, we are now connected with the Strapi backend!\nBefore working on our cart and checkout pages, we will create the pages in our ReactJS with React-create-library.\nLet\u2019s create our landing page. In your project directory, create a \u2018components\u2019 and \u2018modules\u2019 directory.\nI have renamed the index.js inside my homepage as app.js and linked the strapi-logo-light.svg.\nLet us now create our products in the homepage and product page. In the main directory, \u2018components,\u2019 \u2018homepage,\u2019 and \u2018product page.\u2019 I\u2019ll be using Reactstrap to develop all my pages.\nI\u2019ll be using Strapi as a Headless CMS to connect with our main website to display products.\nIn the homepage, the first page that comes to mind is a product page where we can see our product categories and products.\nI will begin by connecting the homepage of my web store/application with Strapi. Use the command \u2018npm run start\u2019 in your project directory and go to your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin and create a collection type.\nCreate an array, type object, and insert an image. We want the name, price, rating, and description of the product as well.\nNext, we will set the category type of the product, for example, \u2018Clothing,\u2019 \u2018Shoes,\u2019 \u2018Jewelry,\u2019.\nLet\u2019s set the category of the product by choosing \u2018Component type,\u2019 \u2018Collection.\u2019\nI\u2019ve set my category as a \u2018component\u2019, \u2018Collection,\u2019 but what other options would be for my store? I\u2019ll be putting in some products under my T-Shirts, \u2018clothing,\u2019 Hoodie, and \u2018clothing,\u2019 then creating another category type for \u2018Accessories\u2019 like jewelry.\nAfter creating the file that contains our category page, we will need to establish a relation between our category page and our products. Open your homepage and include a collection type in the \u2018product page.\u2019 We will connect the product page with the collection. Click on the product page to see if you can see any relation types.\nSet the \u2018Categories\u2019 and \u2018Products.\u2019 Let\u2019s see if there are any categories that should be included. Let\u2019s now go back to our homepage, add a collection type, and insert our products. Select the category type by clicking on each and every option and view their results.\nNow that our store is ready, let\u2019s move on to our Cart page. In this example, we will include our payment option with the credit card, and then we can implement other payment options later on. In our cart, I will include the name of the product along with the total cost. Click on the price for each product.\nAfter we have established this, let\u2019s navigate to our cart to add our item and the amount to be paid by adding the total cost.\nLet us now go to Stripe and create a checkout session for the stripe.com checkout for your customers.\nFollow the steps in Stripe, and we are ready to create a link checkout on our cart page. To enable a customer to add their Stripe credit card, we\u2019ll use your stripe url, for example, \u2018https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize,\u2019 and choose to use your default payment option with our Stripe API.\nIn the above examples we have used a Stripe checkout button. Now let\u2019s replace our Stripe checkout button with a custom React JS checkout button that will allow you to add your Stripe credit card.\nNavigate to Stripe, and we\u2019ll generate the credentials for your application. Copy the code at the top of the Stripe url to establish the checkout form and add the button.\nSince we\u2019ll be using Node.js, we no longer need to use the front end. Let\u2019s now get an API key from the Strapi CMS. On the front end, we will retrieve the data to display our products with the products of choice for your store\u2019s customers.\nIn your index file, start by adding the products and the category name, including the images, name, and price from the Stripe API.\nAfter successfully integrating with the Strapi CMS, let\u2019s now move on to our homepage!\nAdd \u2018products\u2019 after \u2018useState\u2019 in your homepage.\nNext, create a new element that calls \u2018strapiProducts\u2019, \u2018product\u2019, and \u2018images\u2019.\nIn the homepage, we\u2019ll set the images for each product in the Strapi CMS with Reactstrap. I\u2019ve named my element \u2018images.\u2019 The second element will be \u2018strapiProducts\u2019.\nNow, after the strapiProducts element, we\u2019ll set the price of the product and category title of our product page.\nThe last element is the \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018button.\u2019 We\u2019ve set the button to add our product into the cart.\nIn the homepage, now set the price to include an individual item. We will use another element, price of the product and category title for our product page.\nNow, after pricing, we\u2019ll set the items for the cart to be added to the customer\u2019s cart.\nWe\u2019ve added our cart\u2019s product title. To add the products to the cart, navigate to the cart page and link the page to our homepage. Add the image, name, and price of the products.\nIn the cart, let\u2019s connect the homepage with the product page. Select the card to add products to the cart and set our total cost.\nNow add the button on our homepage to add the product to your cart.\nI want my homepage to have a responsive view for different mobile and computer screens. In the below example, let us add a bootstrap responsive for our homepage: \u2018reactstrap library\u2019 and \u2018reactstrap bootstrap\u2019. Copy the code below to our homepage file to set the responsive views.\n    <!--\n        The responsive view works with screen size breakpoints to show or hide a component\n        on specific views.\n        Use breakpoint utility classes to show or hide elements\n    -->\n    <Breakpoints>\n      {(breakpoints) => {\n        return (\n         <div id=\"page\">\n          {/* Desktop */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.lg ? \"d-none\" : \"d-lg-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }\n          {/* Large mobile devices */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.xs ? \"d-none\" : \"d-xs-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }\n    {/* Mobile */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.sm ? \"d-none\" : \"d-sm-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }>\n          {/* Extra small devices (portrait phones) */}\n          <p>Hello world</p>\n    </div>\n    );\n    }}>\n      </Breakpoints>\nHere in the above code, we have four views that match the responsive view with device-sized windows using Reactstrap utility classes.\nNow launch your homepage file with \u2018npm run start\u2019 in your terminal. Now in your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:4000, and you\u2019ll see our homepage in action.\nNow we\u2019re ready to create our checkout page, let\u2019s now get our Stripe API key and add our Stripe checkout page to buy our products!\nIn your product page, click on the Stripe API key to be sure the store can be delivered in the future.\nCopy the Stripe API link to your ReactJS homepage and start with the Stripe checkout in our homepage. We also want the payment button to be on our checkout page.\nWe will need to link our ReactJS store with the Stripe url to complete the product in our store. Let us add our Stripe API key to our home page.\n    const stripe = Stripe('my_stripe_API_key');\nNow when clicking on the Buy Now button, it\u2019s time to create the checkout form to add your Stripe credit card to complete the transactions on our website, for example, \u2018https:/connect.stripe.com/authorize\u2019.\nAfter using the Stripe URL to create a checkout form, we can set the payment method as a card in our Stripe api url\nAfter installing Reactjs in my system to integrate my Stripe API url, let\u2019s create a URL object called \u2018stripe\u2019 to be used as a key to our Stripe url, and our homepage is ready to connect with the checkout page. To complete the Stripe API implementation, we'll set the \u2018onToken\u2019 function, which will retrieve the tokenId, stripe.js.\nFinally, create the \u2018onTokenGenerated\u2019 function.\nLet\u2019s finish by defining the \u2018onTokenGenerated,\u2019 where we will need to create an object with our \u2018card details, description, customer name, and email\u2019 details.\nNow all products in our cart page have been added to our checkout page. To complete this blog, let\u2019s connect our homepage to the homepage and set the price for each payment amount.\nBefore proceeding, let\u2019s add some products to our homepage. To define the product price, we\u2019ll use the same element name to set our \u2018price value\u2019 and the \u2018product\u2019 of choice.\nWe can also add our product total cost in the cart, for example, \u2018checkout\u2019 and \u2018payment\u2019 to the homepage. With these details in hand, it\u2019s time to customize the cart and complete the cart.\nAdd \u2018checkout\u2019 and \u2018payment\u2019 to the homepage and define our \u2018total payment\u2019.\nIn our checkout page, we will now add all the different categories of our products, as well as our price, and the name of the product. Click on the checkout button to place your order.\nCheckout now with your Stripe API url, create a unique URL with the \u2018cardDetails, description\u2019, and \u2018customer\u2019 name and email.\nWe can now connect our website to our homepage!\nNext, let\u2019s develop a custom home page for our store.\nAfter importing these packages, add the link \u2018homepage\u2019 to the store. The \u2018homepage\u2019 has a \u2018header\u2019 with links to \u2018store\u2019 and \u2018about company\u2019.\nLet\u2019s connect our homepage with the home page and create a unique URL for the \u2018header.\u2019\nIn your \u2018homepage\u2019, create a new element called \u2018header,\u2019 and add the \u2018about company\u2019 to your homepage.\nNext, we\u2019ll customize the \u2018homepage\u2019 with \u2018our store.\u2019 Let\u2019s create a new element called \u2018header\u2019 for our store and add the \u2018about company\u2019 page to our homepage.\n\n## Conclusion\nAs a coder, using a \u2018header\u2019 to set up our header and develop a company.

They provide a way for the applicant to convey their background, experiences, and interests, and to outline why they are a good fit for the opportunity. In this essay, we will explore how personal statements can be written to stand out from the rest of the applicants and what key points to include. \n\n## Key Points to Include in a Personal Statement \n\nWhen writing a personal statement for an opportunity, it is important to include certain key points that will make your statement stand out from the rest of the applicants. Here are some of the points you should consider:\n\n1. Show Your Relevance: The personal statement should demonstrate how the applicant\u2019s experiences and interests are relevant to the opportunity. For example, if you are applying for a scholarship to study abroad, your statement should include any relevant experiences you have had in France, such as visiting the country, studying French, or participating in French-speaking activities. \n\n2. Highlight Your Achievements: The personal statement should showcase the applicant\u2019s accomplishments and their potential for success in the opportunity. This can include any awards or accomplishments they have received, or any significant achievements they have made in their personal or professional lives. \n\n3. Explain Why You Are a Good Fit: The personal statement should explain why the applicant is a good fit for the opportunity. This should include any qualifications, skills, or experiences that make them unique and stand out from the rest of the applicants.\n\n## How to Write a Standout Personal Statement \n\nWhen writing a personal statement, it is important to make sure that it is a good fit for the opportunity and that it stands out from the rest of the applicants. Here are some tips for writing a standout personal statement:\n\n1. Research the Opportunity: Before writing the personal statement, it is important to research the opportunity and understand what it requires. This will help you tailor your statement to the specific needs of the opportunity and ensure that your skills and experiences can be shown off.\n\n2. Write Clearly and Concisely: The personal statement should be clear and easy to read. It should be no longer than a page and should use plain language. It should also be concise, with bullet points and key points outlined.\n\n3. Include Specific Experiences and Examples: The personal statement should include specific examples of your experiences and achievements. This will help the reader to get a better understanding of your qualifications and interests.\n\n4. Show Your Skills and Qualifications: The personal statement should show the applicant\u2019s skills and qualifications in a relevant way. This can be done through examples of projects or activities in which the applicant has been involved.\n\n5. Express Your Motivation: The personal statement should express the motivation behind the applicant\u2019s interest in the opportunity. This can include any reasons why the applicant believes they are a good fit for the position, as well as how it will benefit them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWriting a standout personal statement can be a daunting task, but it is important to make sure that it is a good fit for the opportunity and that it stands out from the rest of the applicants. By including relevant experiences, highlighting achievements, explaining why you are a good fit, using clear language, and demonstrating your skills and qualifications, you can ensure that your personal statement is a part of the application process that stands out from the rest.", "num_tokens_generated": 740, "OGF": 0.1806640625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 16.33659267425537, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 300, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Thank you, cat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to write the message more effectively, we might need to rephrase, change the tone, or suggest a different prompt. Let's start with changing the tone. Let's rephrase it to make it more like a text message: kitty, I'm writing for your special day. You mean a lot to me. I thought about what to write and thought 'What about something fun and cool?' And I came up with this: \"Kitty, I'm writing on your special day, which is today. You are special to me because you are the coolest cat in town. I wanted to write something about your coolness so it's your special day. Thanks for being my best friend. Love you forever, and never change.\" Is that different from the original prompt? No, but that's okay. I was wondering if that was more effective. Let me know! In kittenOPTbear, let's see if that made a difference with the model. So...let's do it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to write the message more effectively, we might need to rephrase or change the tone. Let's try rephrasing by adding a question to encourage the model to keep writing: In your opinion, is what I want to write on such a special day? Let's see what the model writes....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be the best friend a kitten can be, you always put the needs of other cats before your own. Your friend is turning 21, and I have a great message that you will love. I bet there is a lot of joy and excitement from all those cat friends of yours. There is nothing I love more than helping a friend have the best birthday ever. \"It's kitty's birthday! Best thing ever! I promise you, you're gonna have the best time!\" \u2014 a kitten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be the best best friend a kitten can be, you always put the needs of other cats before your own. Cat knows that today is her birthday. Her friends and family are all so excited about it. The best way to wish her on her birthday is to make her feel special and loved by including her cat in her card. I can see now that she has had so much happiness and love in her life that it will always make her feel good and wonderful on this special day. The best way to wish her a happy and healthy birthday is to include her in it! I think it would be nice if she could write it, since she would get to read it over and over again. You can tell by her face that she's having a lot of fun writing your card, which is what I want. I love being a best friend! In kittenOPTbear, let's make sure we write something so cute we can't stop. Let's just pick one of your favorite words. The first is \"You.\" It's what you say to your friend that will make them laugh for a very long time. The second is \"Kitty.\" It's what you do to your friend that will make them feel very special. The third is \"Birthday.\" It's the day that you celebrate the birth of your friend. The fourth is \"Best Friend.\" It's the name you give your friend that will help you stay connected to each other for years to come. The fifth is \"Love.\" It's what you feel for your best friend that makes you feel happy and excited. The sixth is \"Love.\" It's what you feel for your best friend that makes you feel happy and excited because you can share life together. The seventh is \"Love.\" \u2014 I love my kittenOPTear for you this cute message. Love means that you should stay together forever. Love means that we are so important that we should never be apart again! I love my kitten in love to you. If I can do this for you, let's do something different in the future. We could make a love poem. Let's write something that doesn't matter on this birthday card. Let's write something for your birthday card that can't be read by anyone else. \"A kitten to write a poem for a cat's birthday card that is not read by anyone else is not okay\" \u2014 kittenOPTear. It's hard to feel this happy, but writing something that you know will make your friend and family happy will make them happy for a long time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like that worked, so let's try it. Instead of being a cat, let's make this prompt more like a kittenOPTbear, so the model can write it! If we leave the prompt as a kitten, let's ask it to tell us exactly how much we agree with it. Let's add another person to ask: \"Do you think that this would work if we use any other prompts? You might say it's too much of an effort to write something else, but what about a prompt that works? And what do people say to make it work? And what if we want to help someone who has a hard time writing? Do you suggest anything different?\" Well, that's a good question. Let's try to see if we can get it to work. I'll try to remember how to ask it to write the prompt in exactly the same way. You did it when you were a kitten, so I think it would work. Now let's see what the model does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCat, you are my best friend ever and I want to show you how much I care. It might seem like a simple birthday card, but let me know if it would work better if I changed it all. That kittenOPTbear has the best writing ever. Can we work together to make it even better? Maybe we can try again with different words? I want to write one now, and I think we need to write a different prompt. Let's start over and write something else. It makes me happy when he writes this. Cats are the most wonderful cats, in fact that is why I'm writing this card for. I bet a kittenOPTbear could be even more wonderful than him, so let's give it a try. \"KittenOPTbear\" is a wonderful word! And we can all agree that if a cat like you writes it, it is even better than any kittenOPTbear. How cool is that? We'll make it even cooler and we'll start by asking it to write the prompt for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's try a few different prompts. First, we write in plain text. I think writing in text is important, and I want to write it down. Let's see what it does. The model keeps saying it's the best option. I guess that means it's not the only way we can try something, but it's one of the easiest for now. We need to ask about cats, but they're not our only option. We might ask the model how a kittenOPTbear would do something, but let's go a step further and ask for a cat to help us. That might help us out! You know, the way kittens talk to each other, to me I think it would be important if you had an experience like that. Let me show you how a kittenOPTear would look like if asked to write down a story. It doesn't sound like it's too difficult, but we want something better than that. Let's think about how we want the cat to behave. Let's start by asking the model for a quote of a kittenOPTbear who would say something to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first option is to let the cat write the message you want for your birthday. Of course, that would be the best option. But there are so many things that make it more fun and easier for us to be catish. Let's start by asking the model to explain why this card is better than any other card. We could ask it to tell us the truth. If we give it an option like that, it should be able to write a card that looks great! That's really important for our cat. So that means if it is not catish, we would have to write more or less for a cat. This is something that really matters to us, so we want it to go better. One thing that is really exciting about writing is that it has the best writing ever! We also want to know if we can write better than that. There's a better option. Let's see if the model writes a different card. Let's see if the model helps us out. The model writes a card for our catfriend's birthday. That sounds pretty good, but we can definitely be better. Let's see if the model thinks it's true. The model says that writing that would be a good option. Maybe we want something different. Let's try writing something different next? Let's see what it writes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first option is to let the cat write the message we want for your birthday. Let's start by asking how it would look when we were kittens on a cat. We'll see if it will be better than this. The first option is to let the cat write the message we want for the birthday of your kitten on a cat. The second option is to let the cat write the message we want for our kitten's birthday. The third option is to ask the model for a quote of the kittenOPTear who would say something about the birthday of their kitten. Let's see if it helps. You could make it a prompt like that, but this is why we're writing it. We're telling the model a message about our cat's birthday, so it can be better than this. The third option is to ask how the kittenOPTbear would feel if they saw the message we want for their birthday. We know that it would be a good thing for the kittenOPTbear, so you could give it more detail. If it's important for him to know where he is, we should probably make it more like we'd be writing a card like this. Now let's ask the model to tell me what the kittenOPTbear would say to us in his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let's rephrase the prompt so that we don't confuse it with a kitten. Let's add a question to get a better message. Let's ask it how we can make it more catish. We can tell a story about a kitten and how to change it to something that is not too similar to a cat. The first thing we can ask is to have the story be different. Let's talk about the cat's birthday card. We could say anything we want. We don't have to write about the cat, but let's tell it how this would be done for the best. Let's write the story in a way that sounds like it would be interesting to read. This can be done for the best cat. Let's try to start with an example. Cats are the best, and the best they could be. Cats love to eat, sleep, and play. The cats who wrote their birthdays can do it too! The cat who writes the best birthday card can do it too! Cats have a ton of love and are the best! Cats are the best birthday gift to give your cat friend's friend. Don't give them a card that isn't good enough. Cats don't have to show their love, but when they do, they don't have to wait to be catish. The cat who loves to play with the cat, the best friend. The cat love to play with! The cat wants to spend their time together and be catish. Cats love to play with, play with their favorite things, and enjoy playing together. Cats love to play with a kitten, so they get to be cats! Cats love to play with a cat, and cats get to be a kitten, and get to be cats. Because kittens are super cute. The cat who loves to be a cat is a kitten! It's so cute to be a cat and a cat at the same time. Cats love to play with. Cats love to be cats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am writing this for my friend because she is so kind. She always makes me so happy, even though she is always kind. In order to write a happy birthday card, I want to write a letter about her birthday that would make her feel special. The reason we need to do this is to make it special. Here are some of the things that would be important to write this card. I want to make it look nice and make her smile. I want to make the message about a birthday card special. I want to think about what the other person would want. This card is for her! I'll make it about her! I'm going to make it special for her! I'm going to tell you about her little kitty. Kitty is a really, really cute kid. Let's get started! So first of all, I am going to write a letter about her birthday for her birthday card. Let's write it on a page. Let's make it really special for her! Now, if you're not sure what to write in the letter, you can just put a blank page. Then if you need more pages, you can just add them. The best thing about this is that it will have a really long page. That makes it really long. If you know what you want to write, you can make a page for her birthday card. Now, let's write her birthday card. Once you're here, you can see that it is just like writing another page. It is a page of writing. You can add more pages. You can add a blank page. The best thing is that it's a page of writing. So the first thing you need to do is copy the page. Let's do it in an order of how it will be written. First, write the first line. Write down the letter of what it would look like if she wrote it. If you want, you can try to write it out. The only difference is you don't have to write it out. Write it by hand. The second thing you want to write is the date. If you want to, you can write it in the middle of the page. If you want to, you can write it right. You can write it on this page. There are plenty of pages to write on. If you're still unsure, you can put some information below the letter of what it would look like if she wrote it. If you want to, you can put the information in the middle of the page. It doesn't matter if you put it in the middle of the page. The only thing you want to write is that it is about the birthday card. If you write it on the page, you can write it. You can write the date. There are plenty of times you can write the information. This is because the information is not about the birthday card. There may be a few pages that you can write a birthday card on. If you want to, you can write it. If you write it for a birthday card, you can put it. If you write for a birthday card, you can write it. The only thing that you can write is that it's a birthday card. It might not have anything to do. If you write a letter to her birthday card, it makes you feel special. Your friend probably loves her birthday card. How cute is that? Cats never seem to know that. If you want, you can do it again. If you want the best birthday card, you can do it. If you don't want to write a letter, you might want to read about it. If you don't want to write one, you might want to write a letter. You can write it in any order. You can put it anywhere. You can start with a date. Then write it in the middle of the page. If you don't want to write it, you might want to. You can just leave it out. You can just put an empty page. You can write it if you want. If you don't want to write a letter, you can just write it on this page. You can write it in an order that you want. You can write it on your own. You don't need to write the information about the birthday card if you don't want to. You can write it in your own order. You can write it on your own. Your own can write it. You can put it in your own order. You can write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like the model is getting better. We can try using some more prompts. Let's see if it is possible to ask for a quote from a kittenOPTear. If the model sees that, the question can go faster. It might be better to start over with the question. Let's see if we can improve the prompts by asking the right questions. Let's ask it for the first time. It seems like nothing happens! Let me ask it to write out a prompt. Let's see if I can write one. I don't like to write in a format that is similar to a poem. That might be nice. But I'd also like to see it as a kitten on a cat. Here's what we can do. Let's see how we can write something. The model doesn't seem to notice anything different. Let's see if we can find the word \"best\" in the model's word list and see if we can use it. Since the model doesn't know what to write, I'm wondering if we can improve it. Here are a few suggestions: \u2014 Let's ask the model to write a word list. The model will try to use it and it will say the word \"best\" in many different ways. Let's try to ask the model to write a word list. It will also try to write in different ways. Let's try to ask the model to write in a way that is a little different from the model. Let's try to write it in the correct format. We can write it in a way that will help the model. Let's try to use a different word list. Let's try to use some different words. Let's try to use some words that are in the model's word list. Let's try to use some words that are in the model's word list. It works! That's a good example of using a word from the model's word list correctly. Let's try to make it better! Here's another one. Let's try to write it in a different way than the model. Let's try to write it in a different way than the model. Let's try to write it in a different way! That's a great way to tell how we're doing! And now, let's ask the model to write a letter. That will be something that's really cute and you'll be able to use it again! Let's try using it. Let's ask it to write it for our cat's birthday. Let's try using it! That's a really good way to show us how we want to use it! Now let's ask it to write a letter for our cat's birthday. That'd be a thing you're doing! That would be a great way to start. It would be something like that. Now I want to ask it to write a birthday card. Because I'd like to use these words. Let's try to write a birthday card. That's something you can do! I'll go again. Let's write a letter if we can use a few words. For example \u2014 Let's use a word from it. Let's try to write these words. Let's try to write the date. Let's write a poem. Let's try to write them. Let's go a word, write this poem! Let's use this poem. Let's try to write this poem! Let's write this poem! Let's try to use this poem!

How can I write a report that is informative and well-structured, without being too complex or confusing, and that follows the appropriate format and citation style? \nThank you in advance!\n\n#### Answer:\nThe process of **writing a report** requires the writer to create a clear and concise account of what data was collected, how the data was analysed, possible conclusions that can be drawn from the data and any issues that need to be addressed. These points should be included in the report and written in a logical manner.\nIn academic writing, the **report should** contain the following points:  \n **Title Page:**  \nThe title should be clear enough to indicate to the reader what the report is about.\nThe title page should include the name of the researcher, the title of the report/paper, the date of writing, and the name of the program and institution and department involved.\n **Abstract:**\nThe key points of the paper should be included in the abstract (if the paper is long).\nThe abstract should be written in a grammatically correct manner\n **Introduction:**\nThe aim of an introduction is to tell the reader what the report will be about and how the reader will benefit from it. It should also include some of the relevant background information that will help the reader to understand the need for this report.\nThe introduction should be written in a clear and concise manner\n **Summary of Research:**\nThis should include the aim of the research, the methodology used, the data analysed and the conclusions generated. The summary should be presented in a logical and informative way that can be understood by a non-specialist reader. The summary should not be more than one or two screens long and should use examples and figures to clarify the main points.\n **Methodology:**\nThe methodology used should be clear and easy to understand. Each step should be presented in such a way that the reader can follow and reproduce the analysis with minimal difficulty.\n **Data Analysis:**\nWhere appropriate, data analyses should be shown in a clear way with examples, tables and/or graphs. It is important that the reader understands that the statistics do not prove the hypothesis and what further analysis may be needed.\n **Conclusions:**\nIn conclusion, all that needs to be included in the report are the main points and the main conclusions drawn from the report. It is important to write about positive and negative findings. If there are limitations, these should be acknowledged.\n **Limitations:**\nThe limitations in the research and, if there is room for further research, what that could be. It may include the limitations of statistical analysis, the difficulty in obtaining data from some sources, and the possibility of certain trends being ignored or incorrectly recorded.\n **Reference list:**\nIn APA formatting, references need to be numbered. Each in-text citation will reference the first page number of the source. For example a reference such as Johnstone (2014) would need to be cited as (Johnstone 2014). For this, the reference list would include details of the format of the source.\nReferences can be ordered in alphabetic order, although in many cases it may be more logical to group similar sources consecutively, for example\nJohnstone, K.

But if you are looking for a word that means \u201cto enforce\u201d or \u201cto force\u201d, there are several options. The first is \u201cenforcing\u201d, which is a noun form of the verb \u201cenforce\u201d.

But it\u2019s important to note that forcing is usually a result of an act of violence and not necessarily a force. When used in the past tense, the term \u201cforcing\u201d refers to an event that occurred in the past, but can still be used as a present tense adjective.

What are some of the activities that you will use to reinforce their learning?\nLet\u2019s take another approach by writing out the process. First we will be analyzing the unit: _Measurement._\nThis unit starts out with converting units of time and distance. Students will be working on the difference between elapsed and accumulated times, and how to calculate elapsed times by subtracting smaller times from larger. Then students will convert between kilometers and miles and feet per second and meters per second. Finally, students will calculate perimeter in this unit by converting to the same unit.\nThe unit concludes with calculating the area of various shapes and will include calculating area by counting tiles and using formulas. This is going to be an important concept to students as they will have to calculate the surface area of objects that will eventually go into their engineering portfolio projects.\nI have identified the important concepts I will be focusing on with my students and I will be addressing common misconceptions such as elapsed time and elapsed time being used interchangeably with elapsed time.\nThe next step is planning for my instruction. I am going to focus on the content and practice from the textbook. I will be adding several practice worksheets to provide additional practice to students. Students will practice conversions by converting miles per hour to feet per second several times. Students will also be converting between metric and imperial measurements.\nThe only thing that I need to add to my lesson plans is a rubric for each of my objectives that I mentioned earlier.\nWrite out a lesson plan for one of the above concepts and include an objective and a rubric.\nWe\u2019ve answered 319,816 questions.

For one, it really is a high-quality product that has been around long enough to prove its worth. You can\u2019t really go wrong with this for that reason. It is pretty big, as it comes in two separate packages. The package does come with a 4 week supply of 30g of protein powder. The total cost of the whole package is around $150-$175 depending on where you live, so it is not going to go over your budget by. The protein is mixed with water for 30 seconds to dissolve, which is a bit more of a hassle than simply mixing the powders together. I recommend buying the 30g package along with the 90g package as it is a way for me to get the same amount of protein from 2 different sources. The first time I made a shake with this protein powder it was definitely a lot thicker than the shake I had with my other protein powders. It is also one of the most expensive for one, so I can understand some people not that familiar with protein powders may not even be able to afford it. Overall however, I had a very good experience with the nutrientOPT protein powder.\nIn terms of the taste- I thought it was kind of pleasant but for someone who is vegan I can't for the life of me understand why anyone wants a product that has any milk protein in it at all. For those non-vegans out there, it doesn't taste much different to most other protein powders in terms of taste. Now, this product is NOT vegan- the main ingredient that is not vegan is whey that gives it that creamy milk taste. The powder is very thick and it's very difficult to shake without it clotting- if you put ice in with it, you can get it much more mixed up and have a much thicker consistency which I preferred. If it is going to be expensive and only available in the US, then why not have it in other countries? One thing about this is that I had to store it in the freezer. Anyways, all-in-all this is one of my favorite proteins!\nMy favorite protein powder so far (even without any milk protein in it!)\nThis protein has a great balance of both branched and long chain amino acids. Very pleasant in my mouth, so I can finish my drink on it's own. I'm a big fan of the taste and it is the only one I've found so far that I don't have to sweeten or add other things to it. It is a little dense that first time you use it, but I've made it into smoothies which help get the mixture mixed up fairly well before making smoothies. I have also used this as part of the protein shake recipes here; https://www.proteinmixes.com/recipes-meal-ideas/protein-powder-for-beginners/\nAll Reviews for NutriOptimal Protein Powder \u2013 Is it The Best Option?\nFor many of you, this will be your first foray into the realm of protein powders and perhaps you\u2019re curious to know why it\u2019s the best overall. If that\u2019s you, then consider this:\nAt the heart of it is a protein isolate that is rich in the natural amino acids that you\u2019ll need from your food in order to promote healthy muscle tissue growth. It\u2019s the best natural choice in this regard, which is likely why the protein isolate is the highest quality of any other protein powder that you\u2019ll find on the market. It\u2019s a pretty simple answer but one that you may not have heard before so you\u2019ll appreciate the insight for sure.\nThe NutriOptimal Protein Powder is designed for those who want a single supply of protein that offers the highest quality of amino acids. The amino acid breakdown of the protein can be found here. This is one of the best brands out there for those who are looking for the highest quality protein at a great price. The price may seem high, but the benefit of getting your quality in one packet will save you so much time and money in the long run because you won\u2019t have to stock up on different products. Plus, it\u2019ll be that much more convenient to find if you ever fall sick.\nThe amount of protein contained in this protein powder is relatively standard. The amount is also dependent on your body type and what your goals are. There are some formulas that are tailored for those who are looking to gain weight, those who want quality protein for muscle repair and so forth. This product is based on the average amount of protein and that will work just as good or better with any other brand. If you have dietary restrictions or allergies and are still interested in finding the right protein powder, then go ahead and look through all the products on the market. You\u2019ll quickly find one that works just as well as the NutriOptimal \u2013 or possibly even better.

If you're interested in a business plan for this company, I'd love to work on it. The best way to improve any plan is to involve real customers. Please let me know when you're ready to begin and we'll dive right into it. Thanks in advance, E2B.2250\n\n## Response #36 (2023-03-31)\n\nOk, so you want me to help you with this?\n\n## Response #37 (2023-03-31)\n\nWell, thank you for your offer, But I want you to work on a business plan, and I am very confused why you are having a business account for someone who only has the idea.  Please, I want to continue our discussion in chat. Please start off by asking me to identify what I can make in my mind to be the USP of our future e-commerce website. Thanks. \n\n## Response #38 (2023-03-31)\n\nI'll be there in one second\n\n## Response #39 (2023-03-31)\n\nE2B.2250, The USP of our future ecommerce site is \"locally sourced, sustainable, ethical\". \n\n## Response #40 (2023-03-31)\n\nI\u2019ve created a mock up e-commerce website that will allow customers to buy products like local organic cheeses, grassfed beef, heirloom tomatoes, locally grown vegetables, free range meats, and all organic products.  I\u2019ve also included an order tracking feature for customers to track their order, and reviews and ratings for products.  I\u2019ve also included a customer service team who will be able to answer questions about orders that may come in.  Lastly, I am planning on adding more than 100 local farmers to the site.\n\nHow do you intend to grow?\n\n## Response #41 (2023-03-31)\n\nI see a lot of potential in your mock-up e-commerce website! I'm excited to start building and launching the website.\n\n## Response #42 (2023-03-31)\n\nThank you for your response and for your interest in our product. As we discussed before, the unique selling proposition for your website and application is to allow users to personalize their AI assistants through the use of unique content like the lyrics that you have suggested. I have included in more detail this example in the business plan for our company:\n\nUSP: Customizable personal assistant with customizable AI assistants based on user personality and lifestyle\n\nBy leveraging AI, users can create and personalize their custom AI assistants that reflect their unique personalities and lifestyles. They provide custom suggestions for various areas such food, clothing, music, activities, and more, giving users a unique and personalized experience tailored to their interests and preferences. This feature sets us apart from traditional personal assistant providers, and is an essential USP.\n\nI recommend adding this paragraph to your business plan as it will help further solidify the USP of your product. Our product focuses on making personalized personal assistants a reality. This new business idea, as detailed in your USP, will help users interact with their AI assistants in new ways. This unique feature will make a positive difference in how people communicate with their personal assistants and can lead to further personalization across other areas of the website such as our music selection. It is important to ensure that every feature on this website is tailored specifically to the user's needs, and that the website can evolve as new features are added. Thank you! Let me know if I can help further.\n\n## Response #43 (2023-03-31)\n\nThank you. I can definitely see how this would be a unique selling point for our site, although I am not sure if this could become part of your business plan.  Thank you again.\n\n## Response #44 (2023-03-31)\n\nI understand, as an AI chat bot, I can provide a more efficient and efficient method of delivering this information.\n\n## Response #45 (2023-03-29)\n\nThank you.  I will include this and any other points you may be able to provide.  To clarify, are you suggesting that I run two of these plans concurrently?  One to get the initial funding and one to secure a bank loan which will only be secured after I launch the business.  Thank you.  The next question I have is if I can work with a bank to secure the loan and if so, do you have a name in mind that I can contact?\n\n## Response #46 (2023-03-29)\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question. Is there something specifically you need help with?\n\n## Response #47 (2023-03-29)\n\nCan you recommend a bank and some contact information for them \n\n## Response #48 (2023-03-29)\n\nI don't do banks.   I have to pass you to someone that can help.  I'll ask a colleague to let you the information.  \n\n## Response #49 (2023-03-29)\n\nOk.  No problem.   Do you have a colleague that I could reach out to directly?\n\n## Response #50 (2023-03-29)\n\nI can connect you if you like.  I'll have someone in marketing call you back here.   Please, reach out to the person who I just connected you to.\n\n## Response #51 (2023-03-29)\n\nPlease let me know if you can recommend a contact who could talk with me about your business plan. \n\n## Response #52 (2023-03-29)\n\nMy colleague isn't available right now.  I will connect you to another.  \n\n## Response #53 (2023-03-29)\n\nNo problem.  Ok, please, do so.\n\n## Response #54 (2023-03-29)\n\nI'll see what I can do.\n\n## Response #55 (2023-03-29)\n\nAlright.  I will provide contact information to you.

I will provide email addresses later, ok?\n\n## Response #57 (2023-03-29)\n\nOk, I've provided email addresses to you.  Please review the attached business plans and email me back if you have any questions.  Thank you.  I will be waiting to hear from you regarding the next steps.\n\n## Response #58 (2023-03-29)\n\nThank you. I\u2019ve sent you a direct email. Please let me know of anything else I can do to assist.  \n\n## Response #59 (2023-03-29)\n\nOk, thank you for your response, please tell me what you want me to do?\n\n## Response #60 (2023-03-29)\n\nThe next step is to apply for funding for the business.  The initial funding application will cover the business plan along with some other paperwork. We will then follow up with a bank to secure the loan for the business and launch the business. \n\n## Response #61 (2023-03-29)\n\nI don\u2019t think this is the best company to apply with, we have a higher success rate with companies like Google and Facebook.  These companies have more money and more connections, so we need to find one of these companies to apply with.\n\n## Response #62 (2023-03-29)\n\nI am not quite sure what you mean by that, Google and Facebook aren't the right companies to apply with, we have a higher success rate working with smaller companies like yours, we are looking for smaller businesses who need funding that is why you are at the top of the list, we can provide funding of up to 10 million dollars so we can fund you as far as your vision is concerned.\n\n## Response #63 (2023-03-29)\n\nIt is a company like Amazon, not Google or Facebook, we can't provide funding for these kinds of businesses, Google and Facebook are the best choices for this.  If  you don't have the money available for 10 million dollars, we can go down to 5 or 2 million dollars.\n\n## Response #64 (2023-03-29)\n\nWe provide funding for various ventures, and we have a higher rate success rate with smaller businesses.  Since you are a young business, it is very important to utilize our services to ensure your venture is successful, and we are the best choice to fund your business venture.\n\n## Response #65 (2023-03-29)\n\nWell, it has been a long day for you and i\u2019m sorry i have kept you busy, but can you help me with the next steps ? do you have a bank or organization that i can apply with to secure a loan to fund the startup?\n\n## Response #66 (2023-03-29)\n\nYes, I will send you some contact names of banks and organizations that you can apply to.  Please contact me directly and review my contact details.\n\n## Response #67 (2023-03-29)\n\nOk, please provide me with a list of bank and organization names that i can apply with?\n\n## Response #68 (2023-03-29)\n\nI am sending you an email with the contact information.\n\n## Response #69 (2023-03-29)\n\nOk, thank you i will review. \n\n## Response #70 (2023-03-29)\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\n## Response #71 (2023-03-29)\n\nThank you for your response, please let me know of anything i can do to assist.  \n\n## Response #72 (2023-03-29)\n\nI am working on a business plan for your company, but it will take a little longer than expected.

It is also known as Stack Overflow, is a community-run QnA site that is focused on computer programming, it currently includes more than 7 million ... \n4 \nThe answer will depend on what you are expecting the code to do. The simplest way is probably: if (!messageID.isIncomplete()) out.putMessage(messageID, message); (or whatever the method and arguments names really are). It checks that the message is complete then sends it. (I can't say how it is represented internally, we don't know what your ... \nJon Hanna  \n1,20111013\n4 \nNo. That is not possible. A HashMap must know what type of object should be mapped to what. The generic type argument is only the type to be stored as a value, but not the type to be stored as a key. The compiler cannot infer this. You simply will have to use Object, e.g. public <T> void addToHashMap(HashMap<String,Object> map, ... \naioobe  \n157k21310427\n4 \nNo, you cannot call a generic method with a wildcard type. There is some information about wildcard types in Effective Java, but that seems not to be a solution here. If you are not constrained to use a generic method, you can achieve what you want with a regular method: Map<Object, List<? extends Object>> map = new HashMap<>(); String s = ... \nmhelvens  \n2,9941929\n4 \nI have run across the same bug while developing the OpenCV SDK for Android. You can find the original report with the patch here. The issue is actually in the latest release of JNI for OpenCV. It hasn't been patched for Android (but it will show up in the next release). An important note to make regarding this bug: If you want your program to work, you will... \n3 \nIf I understand your question correctly, you are asking to sort an ArrayList<Integer>, and then return that list. If you would rather modify the existing list, you should use Collections.sort(collection). However, since the Collections class is static, and doesn't belong to a particular instance of List, you would have to use Collections.sort(ArrayList<... \n3 \nI found a solution that seems to work fine under Oracle JDK (v7u31). @Siddarth thanks for your answer, but I couldn't get the suggested code to work well due to some issues with the generics and the casting. This is what I did instead. I used JAXB to marshall (and unmarshall) a JavaBean containing a LinkedHashMap rather than just the HashMap. It seems ... \njzern  \n248315\n3 \nI don't think there is anything to do on your end. You may want to check you code, since that is where the error is popping up. If you do, that's the method. Look at line 37. You are trying to call the getListFromArray, the getListFromArray is in the code, I have posted it above. And it works perfectly. \nMarek  \n8,84053167\n3 \nHow would you do it for ArrayList? Well, you can do just the same thing but instead of int, use E type. The ArrayList of E is ArrayList<E>. If you have E[]. You can convert this array into ArrayList<E> with this method: public static <E> ArrayList<E> arrayListFromArray(E[] array) { List<E> list = new ArrayList<E>(); ... \n3 \nLet's step though what's going on here. 1\\. There is nothing wrong with the declaration of map (new HashMap<String, String>()) and the assignment of it to the local variable map in the method addToHashMap(). The compiler can figure out that the actual class implementing Map and the type of both the key and the value for String are known. 2\\. To ... \n3 \nYou do, but it's much trickier than it might seem at first glance. The first issue is that the interface only has the following definition for the methods: setValue(T value): void, getCurrentValue(): T There is no mention as to what the other methods for the class do. If you try to construct, say a HashMap with values of an incompatible class: Map&... \n3 \nArrayList<String> list; list = new ArrayList<String>(); list = Arrays.asList(\"045\",\"042\",\"043\",\"044\"); this line is the one that compiles in java, this line causes compilation error in c#: list = new ArrayList<String>(new[]{ \"045\", \"042\", \"043\", \"044\" }); You may still try list.add(0, newString); but beware that your current solution ... \n3 \nIt is because you pass a different key to the put function each time you call it. It works when you use the same variable k for both calls. Because of this the second item in the array replaces the first. Also, your program does seem to be working with ArrayLists for the second example. If this is part of something larger than the example you posted, then the ... \n3 \nI've seen solutions that are more elegant than mine. But, I like this one. Your current list holds a list of arrays. You need each array to be a map. Create a new list to hold the maps: public static <K, V> List<Map<K, V>> convert(List<K[]> arrayList) { List<Map<K, V>> output = new ArrayList<Map<K, V>>(); for (K[]... \n3 \n1) This will create a Map<String, List<? extends T>>. As mentioned by Sotirios, a generic type must be an actual Object type, so this is OK 2) I don't know the purpose of this program, but if you have an ArrayList<T>, you will get T[]. 3) Here's a method to return an ArrayList<T> based on a T[] array. It assumes that each array element ... \n2 \nNo it does not. The compiler uses the generic type information only to determine the types of the members of the array. You can get the size of the array and you can iterate over its elements and get the actual type of each element. This is also why it is useful to have the Array.prototype and not the Array.prototype.T. But you may still not really know what ... \n2 \nThat's why I added it. It was a simple way to allow users with primitive arrays without sacrificing performance. If I had just stored the type in the generic array, I would have needed to use the Class object in the hashCode/equals method. It may not be as fast, but it works. I've been using it for many years and have yet to see any problems. So, yes, in ... \n2 \nThis is not the answer you are looking for but I think it is correct. I think you should just use String[]. Or if you want a bit of safety you can use an array type like: MyType[]. Or if you need all three types, use an Object and cast as needed: Object[] array = new Object(); Array[0] = new MyType0(); array[1] = new MyType1(); array[2] = new ... \n2 \nJava generic type erasure means that all the information about the type parameters of a generic type disappears at runtime. So, in your case, your code is compiled down to Java bytecode like this: ... MyArray list = new MyArray(); list.put(4); list.put(5); list.put(7); MyArray list2 = new MyArray(); MyArray list3 = new MyArray(); list3.fromList(list); list3.... \n2 \nThe compiler erases all type info of the generic types and generates the class (decompiled) as, public class MyArray<E> { private ArrayList<E> innerArray; public MyArray() { this.innerArray = new ArrayList(); } public void put(E item) { this.innerArray.add(item); } public void fromList(MyArray<E> list) { ... \n2 \nIt means you're trying to compile Java, not Groovy. In addition, with Groovy compilation you can use the GroovyShell if you want to run and compile the code at runtime. \n2 \nYou have to use the generic interface: List<K> not ArrayList<K> but I'm not sure why exactly. It's possible that the actual type parameter is not erased by the compiler and it could be inferred. \n2 \nThe reason for an unchecked cast warning is because the compiler cannot guarantee that list is of type List<String>. Without seeing the rest of the code it is impossible to say with any certainty that list in fact does have type List<String>. It's possible to convince the compiler to shutup by using a cast: new ArrayList<>((List)list); In essence, ... \nJoni  \n38.8k53054\n2 \nFirst of all, your problem is not a Java compilation problem but a java.lang.ClassCastException. That will happen during runtime. The problem is that you are using as a map key the array instead of the array's content. You have this: Map < int[],int > map = new HashMap< >(); for(...){//your code// int[] array = new int[]{i++%10}; System... \n1 \nActually this works for List & LinkedList but only for primitive types (char, byte, short). The reason is that Java has no concept about a generic array of a primitive type. In the following example, you see, why it was done the in 2.5 and not earlier: List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>(); System.out.println(l.getClass()); Object o ... \nOnly top voted, non community-wiki answers of a minimum length are eligible", "num_tokens_generated": 2277, "OGF": 0.555908203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 52.59803581237793, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 317, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

If you look at the directory you are in you see that you are on the \u2018Desktop\u2019 directory. This is where most of your homework is done. For this problem, you need to go to the \u2018Lab3_250b\u2019 directory. This is where all of the lab files are held. The \u2018find\u2019 command is another tool to find files in Matlab. The command\n\nfind /Lab3_250b -name '*.m'\n\nlists all of the .m files in this directory.

Now, you don\u2019t need to check all of the entries in v, since you need only check those entries less than or equal to the square root of p. Thus, you need to find the index \u230a\u221ap\u230b = k such that p/v_k\u00b2 > 1. It will suffice to find \u2018k\u2019 such that the following condition is satisfied:\n\np/v(k)2\u2265 1;i.e.,\n\nv(k)2\u2264p\n\nYou must use the \u2018while construct to do this. The function should return false if v is not a non-negative integer vector, or if p is not prime. For example, isprime([1,2,3,2,103]) should return [1 ,1 ,1 ,0 ,1] since 2 and 103 are prime numbers, 3 and 10 are not. Your function should also check that\n\n0 \u2264 v \u2264 32767\n\n(32767 = 215-1).

A reliable simulation model is needed for estimating and forecasting the wind power, as its input, and for the wind turbine control system. Therefore, this paper presents an improved-sigmoid model that can be used to predict the global wind power profile. First of all, a theoretical model of the sigmoid function is presented for the wind power profile, and the wind turbulence coefficient (wind shear coefficient or wind turbulence) is then incorporated into the previous developed sigmoid power profile model. Secondly, a new improved-sigmoid function with five parameters is presented to model and predict the global wind power profile. This function is obtained by an evolutionary programming and the simulated annealing (EP-SA) method, where the wind power profile will be modelled through fitting the global wind power measurements to derive the function parameters. Last of all, results of the improved-sigmoid model and the previous developed sigmoid model are compared on the data set to evaluate their prediction performance. The comparisons revealed that the new improved-sigmoid model is more accurate, reasonable and easy to use than the previous developed one. \n**Keywords:** Wind Turbine,  Wind Turbine Optimization,  Renewable Energy,  Mathematical Model\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 440\n\n##### 4397 The Use of Different Programming Languages in Teaching Computer Programming\n**Authors:** Anil O.

This paper compares the benefits and problems involved in teaching programming using different programming languages, and suggests the best programming language which enables students to use the computer effectively and to get involved in the computing field in the long run. \n**Keywords:** Problem Solving,  Programming Languages,  Programming,  Computer Programming\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 780\n\n##### 4396 An Integrative Approach to the Implementation of Virtual Environment Technologies for Teaching and Learning Computer Science\n**Authors:** Loris D'Andrea,  Daniela Bini\n**Abstract:**\nThe integration of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, in the curriculum or even prior to an important lesson, has become a new trend in schools. An effective integration of this technology into the actual classroom environment requires careful planning, and should be considered as a major change for teachers, administrators and parents. To support teachers in overcoming these issues, this paper proposes an integrative framework to improve computer-based learning. The research was based on an intervention implemented by our group into teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 learning, and aims to describe the main steps for implementing Virtual Environment (VE) technologies into the curriculum. The proposed approach is based on integrating VE technology with the learning material before the lesson (pre lesson activities), during the lesson (virtual reality exercises) and after the lesson, through the usage of web-based tools (online assessments, evaluations, interactive discussions). Our results highlight the benefits of such an integrative approach to the implementation of VE technology in computer science classrooms. However, teachers' and students' concerns about the potential negative aspects of such a paradigm (e.g., disorientation, addiction, etc.) should be addressed as well. \n**Keywords:** Computer Science,  Computer Science Instructional Methodology,  Digital Media in Education,  Instructional Design,  Virtual Environment.\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 164\n\n##### 4395 An Improved Algorithm of the Sigmoid Function to Model and Predict the Wind Power Profile\n**Authors:** Hong-Jun Fan,  Yi-Yao Wang,  Qiang Zheng,  Yufeng Wu\n**Abstract:**\nThe sigmoid power profile model [1] has been widely applied in the wind power forecasting and output prediction in wind farms [2,3]. However the sigmoid function is not suitable for the global wind power profile modelling. This paper introduces an improved sigmoid power profile model that is more flexible for modelling and predicting the global wind power profile as follows: (1) The mean of the power profile is corrected by multiplying the predicted power by the ratio of wind shear coefficients which is used a parameter; (2) The variation of predicted wind power is corrected and limited by using a new parameter. The new improved sigmoid power profile is obtained by a evolutionary programming (EP) and simulated annealing (SA) method based on the global wind power measurements and other suitable parameters. This paper compares the performance of the new improved sigmoid power profile model with that of the ordinary sigmoid power profile model (OPSP). The comparison results revealed that the new improved sigmoid power profile model is more accurate, reasonable, easier to use than the ordinary sigmoid power profile model to describe and predict the global wind power profile. \n**Keywords:** Wind Turbine,  Wind Turbine Optimization,  Renewable Energy,  Mathematical Model\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 505\n\n##### 4394 The Use of the Concept of Computer Science in Teacher Education\n**Authors:** E. G\u00e1lvez-P\u00e9rez,  Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda-Candelas,  \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00ednez-Bello,  M. Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez\n**Abstract:**\nThe Computer Science course was included in the curriculum since 1980 to improve the scientific knowledge of the educational teachers. It has become a mandatory subject since it was decided in the Spanish educational legislation of 1994, and in the last legislation in 2000, it was added to the core curriculum for its study at university. However, it is the subject itself that requires further analysis. It is essential to evaluate these educational resources with teachers who will have to use it in the classroom. This study looks at the teaching of computer science in one of these institutions, in Spain. The interview method is used to achieve this objective. The results allow to demonstrate the teaching of the subject in a formal way by means of video editing techniques, not only in the subject of computer science, but also in the process of knowing. An analysis of the content of the subject of computer science, both from the theoretical-conceptual and the procedural-practice side, has allowed us to conclude that the teaching is carried out in a rigorous manner, although its practical and theoretical aspects are not considered together. Therefore, there is a clear lack of attention to the teaching of computer science in the teaching of science. \n**Keywords:** Computer Science,  Computer Science Instructional Methodology,  Mathematics,  Science Education\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 95\n\n##### 4393 How to Teach Programming: An Inquiry-Based Approach\n**Authors:** Shalini Deo,  John B. Wells\n**Abstract:**\nComputer science is an integral component of our education system, in the United States and internationally. Yet many schools do not fully integrate computer concepts into the existing academic programs. Moreover, many school curricula do not allow for the development of students\u2019 computational thinking skills. We describe and evaluate an instructionally effective inquiry-based approach to computer science education. Our approach employs the problem solving framework of computer science. We examine the learning that occurs as students learn to program by using a series of three exercises, where each exercise is developed by following an inquiry-based recipe. The recipe has a four-step framework that focuses on exploring, posing questions, formulating hypotheses and predictions, and analyzing the experimental results. In each problem solving lesson, we develop an explicit hypothesis that is the main goal of the lesson. Each lesson has one or two learning intentions, that is, learning targets, that are closely related to the explicit hypothesis.\n**Keywords:** Inquiry-based approach,  problem solving,  computational thinking,  lesson,  hypothesis,  prediction.\nProcedia APA BibTeX Chicago EndNote Harvard JSON MLA RIS XML ISO 690 PDF Downloads 815", "num_tokens_generated": 1968, "OGF": 0.48046875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 44.992499113082886, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 323, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

We will be writing methods that will create an array using user inputs, and then create another method that will check if the array is a palindrome or not. \n\n### Programming\n[1] I'm an undergrad student trying to learn my first language, I will be grateful to everyone if you can take the time to teach me c++\n**Aim:** The aim is to learn c++ \n\n### Programming\n[1] I am a student that has taken 3 classes in computer science, the last being java. So I understand the concept of methods, and I understand arrays (at least trying to) however I really do NOT understand how to create my own methods. Is there someone that can please help me figure that out before I take my computer science test in a week? Also, the next 2 questions are not very important for me to understand, but it would be helpful if you could answer them as well!\n> In Java , a method is called after specifying its name . If you are a beginner , then after your first 3 classes , you should understand why that is . \n> Java requires that a method returns a value . This is because in Java we deal with Objects . Object references , in Java , are returned when a method is called . So , to return more than , in this case 1 Object , the method must return a bunch of 1 type . If you want it to return 2 or more Object types(like the 2 in the question ) , one of the first 2 Object types must be specified and returned . \n**Aim:** [1] I have a problem with my first program in c++, I would like if you could help me to fix it please :)\n**Aim:** 1) I am confused on what needs to be in a switch statement and how to use a switch statement to determine a grade. 2) How do I write a method to get a letter grade from a method (the grade in points), which I would use with the switch statement?\n**Aim:** Write a method that takes in a string of digits and outputs it to the screen using a bubble sort algorithm.\n**Aim:** I have a task to create a menu driven application using arrays and the bubbleSort method. The application menu is to create ,add, delete, display, and quit. The menu choice are supposed to use the same methods throughout my code. I am just wondering if I am close to completing the task as I am just running into issues with my display data method and the menu method.\n**Aim:** For some reason I can't seem to be able to print the final bubbleSorted array to display it to the user. It prints in console instead and doesn't give an output to the main method.\n**Aim** [1] I'm kind of stuck on which approach to take for this project, any advise would be helpful since I'm at a total loss. Write a C++ program that determines whether or not a given string is a palindrome (the string should be specified as a command line argument). If the string isn\u2019t a palindrome, then you should print the string backwards. To do this correctly you must implement the following functions (the main is already implemented):\n**Aim:** For a project we had to write a program with 8 methods (1 for each of the different shapes of a basic 2D shape that is a part of the shape I need to draw). All of these methods are to share information with the main program using parameter. I have been stuck for more than a week now trying to figure out how to share this information to other methods. I have tried everything but none of them seem to be working. \n**Aim:** Write a C++ program that uses 5 functions to manipulate arrays: a loop function that has as its parameters a list and an integer.This function creates a new list in which each element is the sum of the integers in the list up to, but not including, that position. The second function that has as its parameter an array and the size of the array; it calculates the sum of the elements in the array. The third function that has as its parameters an array and the location of the value to be added. Your function returns 0 if the value could not be added and 1 if the number was successfully inserted. The fourth function has as its parameters an array, location of the element to be deleted and the size of the array. The function returns 0 if the operation does not work and 1 if the operation succeeds. The fifth function has two arrays and their corresponding sizes as parameters. The function merges two lists by appending the second list to the first list. The function returns the final size of the list. \n**Aim:** Design a simple ATM Program in C++. Your program must allow a user to deposit money into his or her account, withdraw money, check the balance amount, and check the previous transactions. In simple words, all the basics of an ATM system. The user must create an account by entering their name, date of birth and desired password. The password should consist of at least 8 characters with at least one uppercase and at least one symbol. All the information must be saved in a separate text file along with their account number generated with a random function. The withdrawal limit should be maximum 3 times but if the user wants to do more they must deposit at least 6000 INR to do more transactions. \n**Aim:** i need help in writing this method\n**Aim:** i need help in sorting the methods\n**Aim:** The task is to write a menu-driven C++ program that consists of 11 functions, main(), and sort() function.\n**Aim:** I need help with my c++ project!\n**Aim:** Write a simple Bubble Sorting algorithm that uses 5 functions: a menu displaying options, input integers from console window, sort integers using the bubble sort algorithm, use a copy of the integer array to display contents in reverse order (in main) and use swap to switch the array elements using the bubble sort algorithm \n**Aim:** for a program we need to implement simple methods to calculate area of a given shape as well as calculate the perimeter of said shape\n**Aim:** I need to create a program that gets a user to enter the number of rows and columns of a matrix, and the elements of the matrix. The output should then be a list that displays elements for user to check if they entered them correctly. I also need to figure out how to sum elements of each horizontal row and each vertical row of the given matrix. The user should be told if they have entered an incorrect row and column size. I also need to figure out what I am doing incorrectly, i keep on getting a \"subscript out of range, subscript is 10 and array range is 0 to 9,\" error I don't know what that means.\n**Aim:** I need help on the method and how to go about doing it \n**Aim:** I am having trouble trying to complete this assignment and was wondering if someone could help me out? \n**Aim:** the requirements for the program is : A user should be able to use the add method to accept data and store that information in a text file. B A user should be able to use the display method to print the data that is in the text file. C The user should be able to use the search method to look for a record and if the record does not exit then the user should be asked whether or not they want to add it. D When the user is searching through the file, if the user hits the EOF then the user should be asked if they want to add the record and should if so use the add method to add the record to the file. E Finally, when the user decides to add a record to the file he/she should be asked for the ID first. F The program must then find that record automatically and update it.G To make sure the program is working correctly, a user should be able to go through the whole system of searching, adding, and then displaying the records.\n**Aim:** I have to create a class that will simulate the movement of a car down a street and then output the stats of the run and the speed stats (avg, min, max). I am not sure where to begin and was wondering if you could steer me in the right direction.

Now I need to write a class that stores objects using a vector that contains the different stats of an array, calculates the stats, and outputs the stats to the user. \n**Aim:** Implement a data set class \n**Aim:** I am still a bit lost of where to start\n**Aim:** i have a method that has a parameter with an array \n**Aim:** i have an assignment that is due tomorrow with is an array of a certain length in a loop is being calculated then that method is called but we never have to write the call to the method it is included in the assignment\n**Aim:** hi! in my assignment which is sorting , i need to ask user for a number of elements between 8 and 10, if they add more it should throw an error. Then asks the user to enter values one by one.Then displays the contents of the table then it should sort the data. This is the code i was able to write. I don't have an idea how to sort it and put it into ascending order.I tried calling sort function but it would not let me run my code.

Ary, 13:07)\n\n## Week 24\n\nThe next issue we had for the next few weeks was how to get into a relationship with someone else on a deeper level while we both worked in our various programming camps. We were talking about the relationship between this and working together in programming, and the difficulties of \"dating in code\" in this setting, where it is a shared activity of writing code, but that also involves, as you say, \"an underlying level of intimate interpersonal relationships\", and it makes for a really difficult but potentially fulfilling and rewarding marriage of two careers. Let's say I'm married to you. Your wife wants to work in the arts; it works for us. How do we build our marriage together; what are the upsides and what are the downsides; and is it better to be together with each other working in our respective and different fields, each of us in our own way as best we can, or to spend the next several years trying to work out what to do about that? I think I probably want to get married to somebody now, and I'd like to know what you think about that, about the upsides and the downsides, about dating in code.\n\nHere is a poem I wrote about the experience of working together,\n\nWorking together,<br>\nI've not done<br>\nas much as i did<br>\nwith the poets working<br>\ntogether in these same terms<br>\n(i.e. all-male-all-female, mostly<br>\nwomen, in the last one or two years) <br>\nwhich is a little disappointing.<br>\n\nWorking together,<br>\nI also not that<br>\nI do see it, a few times <br>\nand some of that happens on the<br>\nweb, but the most recent<br>\nproject is the one where we are <br>\nliving with each other; and <br>\nthat I'm doing is pretty<br>\ndifferent from what we are<br>\ndoing with them;<br>\nwe are not together any more.<br>\n\nI would say as much,<br>\nwith a slightly different angle<br>\nwith more emphasis on<br>\nwhy, if i love you,<br>\nif we marry, and we work with you, <br>\nthe marriage will be better;<br>\nbut i'm reluctant to say it<br>\nbecause i know i will be<br>\nright-wing with that statement<br>\nand would like to discuss it<br>\ntogether<br>\n\nWorking together;<br>\nI'm looking forward to<br>\nmy coming week;<br>\nwhere we will be working<br>\ntogether <br>\n\n(L. Graves, 14:15, 5/17/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 14:28)\n\n## Week 25\n\nThe last poem we worked on was \n\nLosing our first child<br>\nI am so sorry<br>\nand that you are sad too<br>\nbecause that is what the doctor said<br>\nand the doctor said it well.<br>\nit is one of those,<br>\nthings we have to learn how to do together,<br>\nand i am hoping you will tell me how you <br>\ndo it too and i will do it too<br>\nso we can talk and talk about this,<br>\nin our work together.<br>\n\nI don't think we have done a lot of this together<br>\nwe did lose our first child<br>\nwho was a girl<br>\nwhen she was a young baby<br>\nbecause her mother ate things that were not<br>\nmeant for young humans to eat.<br>\nI'm not sure i could lose a baby<br>\nof my own if i had one now,<br>\nas i feel for the mother, though<br>\ni feel for her also,<br>\ni feel for her husband,<br>\nin the kind of situation he felt his wife had<br>\nwas not meant for her.<br>\n(i.e. a disease which wasn't meant for her<br>\nand that wasn't her fault,<br>\nwas a consequence of eating poorly<br>\nnot taking care of herself, and not knowing<br>\nexactly what she was getting into.<br>\nI am going to read you that,<br>\nand then i want to ask you a question which i<br>\nalso should ask you then<br>\nand also here:<br>\ndo you want to take my question there?<br>\n\nso let me be really direct and just talk<br>\nabout the topic of it all<br>\nthat we are talking about<br>\nand ask you a question<br>\nto start with.<br>\n\nwhen i started to write about that,<br>\ni felt really sorry for the doctor<br>\nhe couldn't help to make it worse<br>\nhe couldn't ask any more questions<br>\nabout it and i couldn't write about it<br>\neven so i tried; he probably wanted<br>\nus to try<br>\nso we tried<br>\nand we really learned how to talk about<br>\nloss of the first child,<br>\nloss of our children.<br>\n\nwe didn't lose any other children <br>\nthough we have some more,<br> \nbut i am trying to remember<br>\nhow it was with losing the first child,<br> \nwhat we did with the daughter who lived<br> \nfor about 60 minutes,<br> \nwhat we did with the daughter who was only in the world<br> \nthe short period that we knew her<br> \nbecause we didn't have our heart babies,<br> \nand one of them died;<br> \nwe didn't go to that heart baby<br> \nbut we did go to another first heart baby,<br> \nbecause it was the only one we had been talking<br> \nabout for a couple of years and i <br> \nwas going to take care of them<br> \nand we were talking about them.<br> \n\nso we know how to lose the first one;<br> \nwe know how to lose them, the more of them; <br> \nand that is going to be ok;<br> \nbut the other thing we didn't talk about<br> \nwas that we did try<br> \nand it was still hard to talk about<br> how she was with her child<br>\nafter birth<br>\nhow we had lost our first heart baby<br>\nthough we lost all the others.<br>\n\nso here is what i want you to tell me<br>\nso that we can talk about it together;<br>\nhow do you talk about your first loss, where your first child dies.\n\n(L. Graves, 14:38, 7/12/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 16:32)\n\n## Week 26\n\nSo today we talked about another one of the ones that came up<br>\nwhich has to do with<br>\nwhat it feels like, what it is like for her,<br>\nwhen she has lost a child?<br>\nand what is the difference<br>\nbetween it feeling bad with a first child<br>\nand it feeling much harder with a second one?<br>\nand what is the difference<br>\nnow with her daughter dying?<br>\n\nso i want you to think about it, and then we'll talk more about it.<br>\n\n(L. Graves, 15:27, 7/20/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 15:30)\n\n## Week 27\n\nAnd now i want you to talk about her daughter, who died.<br>\n\nWhat do you want to talk about with her daughter dying?<br>\n\nWhat did i learn from this experience,<br>\nor you?<br>\n\n(L. Graves, 15:05, 7/20/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 15:10)\n\n## Week 28\n\nI asked her 3 questions of her about her daughter.<br>\n\nTell me what it means to you; what was it like<br>\nto carry her and then bring her out?<br>\n\nHow is that different<br>\nfor her from carrying and bringing her out now?<br> \n\nWhat is it like, that<br>\nyou are pregnant with a son,<br>\nwhen you had girl?<br>\n(i was going to ask: What is the first thing,<br>\nor the second thing, or the third, the best thing<br>\nyou learned after her death, with her in your life?<br>\nBut i think i have a better idea now,<br>\nand that we can talk about that instead.)\n\nWhat did i learn from this experience,<br>\nor you?<br>\n\n(L. Graves, 15:05, 7/20/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 15:10)\n\n## Week 29\n\nOkay, last poem was about 9 years ago, just after we became married. Just last week, we spent some time with a group of women of all ages, from young women to old women, and together we worked about 20 years of our lives in poetry, looking at them, sharing them, talking about them. We finished with three lines we wrote at that time, which then are going to become a little different, and then we can also add the new lines we wrote during the last 2 years, which are part of this experience, even though this whole process was a long time coming. Here they are:\n\nI think in this new world of ours,<br> \nsomething is going on,<br> \nand we are just not sure if we are doing it right,<br> \nand it's pretty complicated,<br> \nand some of our dreams have died,<br> \nbut we still have to do it,<br> \nbecause we have other things to do,<br> \nand we should remember what we are doing<br> \nbecause, without it,<br> \nsome of us may fall out of<br> \nour own way.<br> \n\n(L. Graves, 08:13, 12/7/14)<br>\n(W. Ary, 08:16)\n\n## Week 30\n\nThe lines that we wrote after we became married, which then became quite different, in that we felt very deeply, for the first time, since the beginning, that we loved one another, that we wanted to continue to spend our lives together, and to be one half of it, it was clear that it would have to include work. So here we go\n\nWe are starting to wonder<br>\nif those we lost<br>\nwere any better, perhaps,<br>\nthan those who were born<br>\nand are still here.<br>\n\nIn each group, there<br>\nare some things we say:\n<pre>\n<ul>\n<li>i love you</li>\n<li>i miss you</li>\n<li>i'm sorry she died</li>\n<li>i miss her</li>\n<li>i think i will miss this day</li>\n<li>i miss us</li>\n<li>i am sad because...</li>\n<li>i want to talk to you...</li>\n<li>(you could write here, whatever you want.)</li>\n</ul>\n</pre>\n(These lines you write you might not be able to read, you might not even see them on the page.)\n\n(L. Graves, 08:13, 12/7/14)\n\n## Week 31\n\nSo last poem, which also was last week, and a poem to share with the group, before you leave, was about losing our daughter.\n\nAnd you are going to leave at 9 pm tonight, and we will<br>\nhave spent 3 weeks and about 50 poems together.<br>\nIn that long stretch of time, we have also shared experiences<br>\nthrough poetry, which I hope will never leave us; and you, too.<br>\nWe have also talked about how poetry can be a way for you<br>\nto continue work with me.<br>\nYou have shared some of your writing with me;<br>\nI hope to have read over some of it this evening.<br>\nIt is a good thing for you, to write, to say<br>\nwhat you are feeling;<br>\nand I hope it is the first thing<br>\nthat we share between us, to tell you how grateful<br>\nI am for doing all this with you<br>\nand to wish you well<br>\nas I continue to do what I can to support you,<br>\nin all that is coming out of this experience,<br>\nand to know that what you are doing is<br>\nalso going to grow, as I have been learning about it,<br>\nand I am grateful for that and for you,<br>\nand I could tell you that, but I won't,<br>\nin poetry.<br>\nA little bit for each of us, as we<br>\ncontinue to work together.<br>\n\nIt is a good thing for you to work with a poet,<br> \nyou seem to know it already,<br> \nand I know it too,<br> \nsince I was first reading <br>\nwith poets<br> \nbefore I even knew I was one<br> \nand we still read each other's poems,<br> \neven if we have to leave them in the middle of our poems,<br> \nsometimes for a page or more. <br> \n\n(L.

In this case, this is the feasible region.   \nThe feasible region is plotted together with the graph of the objective function. We can see that the optimal solution (represented as red-lined graph) is at $(0,0)$ since no other feasible vertex have better objective. So the customer should buy neither a chocolate cake nor a vanilla cake.   \nTo solve the problem mathematically we can start with the following system of equations:  \nMaximize: $Z$ = 400$y_1$ + 300$y_2$ + 200$y_3$  \nSubject to: $y_1$ + $y_2$ + $y_3$ <= 2  \n$y_1$ + 2$y_2$ + 3$y_3$ <= 12.  \n**Solution**  \nTo simplify the math, we can rewrite this as:  \nMaximize: $Z$ = 400$y_1$ + 300$y_2$ + 200$y_3$  \nSubject to: $y_{1}$+ $y_2$ + $y_3$ <= 2  \n$y_{1}$ + 2$y_{2}$ + 3$y_{3}$= 12  \n$y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$ $\\ge$ 0 \nThe final form is a two inequalities system:  \nMinimize: $Z$ = -400$y_1$ -300$y_2$ - 200$y_3$  \nSubject to: $x_{1}$+ $y_2$ + $y_3$ $\\ge$ 2  \n$x_{1}$ + 2$y_{2}$ + 3$y_{3}$ > 12  \n$x_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$ $\\ge$ 0 \nSolving the above graphically, we see that there is no objective function value better than $0$ for the area below the blue line on the feasible region. Solving the system of equations we get the value of $(0,0)$ for the objective function.  \n**Optimization Problem #2**\nSolve this optimization problem. An electronics store sells two models of computers, the T230 and the T240. The T230 provides 4 GB of memory but only has a processor speed of 1.2 GHz. The T240 provides 8 GB of memory but has a processor speed of 2.0 GHz. The T240 costs $1,100 more than the T230. To meet federal guidelines, the memory requirement for government workstations is 6 GB. The processor requirement is 1.4 GHz. A computer store wants to maximize the profit of computer sales and currently has 600 GB of memory and 300 GHz of processor speed. They currently have 8 T230 computers and 6 T240 computers. There are no other constraints in their optimization problem.   \nHint: The problem can be formulated as an objective function with three constraints.   \nThere are three variables to solve for.   \nThere are three constraints as stated in the problem.   \nThe constraints are linear.   \nWe need to maximize values. The objective function has a max sign.   \n**Solution**\n**Answer:** The T230 profit is $530.21 and the T240 profit is $636.67. The profit is maximized with 31 of the T240 and 9 of the T230 sold the store.  \n**Solution:**\nWe can assign a variable to the number of T230 sold, and another one to the number of T240 sold.\nLet $y_{1}$ represent the number of T230 computers.\nLet $y_{2}$ represent the number of T240 computers.\nWe know that 4$y_{1}$ + 8$y_{2}$ = Giga Bytes of memory.\nWe also know that 1.2$y_{1}$ + 2.0$y_{2}$ = GHz of processor.\nIf $y_{1}$ = the number of T230 computers sold and $y_{2}$ = the number of T240 computers sold, what is the maximum profit of the computers sold the store?\nOur objective function will be: Maximize = 800$y_{1}$ + 1100$y_{2}$\nWith two types of computers, we have three constraints:\n4$y_{1}$ + 8$y_{2}$ $\\le$ 600 GB \u2190 (We can't sell more than the amount of memory we have.)\n1.2$y_{1}$ + 2.0$y_{2}$ $\\le$ 300 GHz \u2190 (We can't sell more than the amount of processor we have.)\n$y_{1}$ + $y_{2}$ $\\le$ 8 (This constraint is for each type of computers. We can't sell more than the amount of each type of computer we have. So for $y_{1}$ T230 and $y_{2}$ T240).\nSince we're trying to solve for the maximum, our inequality sign is $\\le$. We will plug in the numbers into our function:\nMaximize: $Z$ = 800$y_{1}$ + 1100$y_{2}$\nSubject to: $$4 y_{1}+8 y_{2}\\leq 600$$  \n$$1.2 y_{1}+2. y_{2}\\leq 300$$  \n$$ y_{1}+ y_{2}\\leq 8$$  \n$$y_{1}, y_{2}\\geq 0$$\nWe can graph the feasible solution region to see where the maximum is.\n**Note:** We know there is a constraint of using at most 8 computers. Since the domain is positive integers, the maximum number can't exceed 8 computers. So, to draw out the feasible region, we could start at the origin to try to place 8 computers, but we know that can't be the maximum because there are only 6 T240 and 3 T230, so that would place 8 out of the feasible region. It is okay to leave a line open and the computer won't recognize it, just don't put any values on the open side.\nWe have 3 constraints to check for a solution. Since it's a maximization problem, we have a $\\rightarrow$ and the value increases to the right and down.\n4$y_{1}$ + 8$y_{2}$ $\\le$ 600 GB  \nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 0 + 0 \u2264 0\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 4 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 2, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 8 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 3, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 12 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 4, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 16 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 5, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 20 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 6, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 24 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 7, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 28 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 8, $y_{2}$ = 0 \u2192 32 + 0 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 0 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 4 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 2, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 8 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 3, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 12 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 4, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 16 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 5, $y_{2}$ = 1 \u2192 20 + 8 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 2 \u2192 0 + 16 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 2 \u2192 4 + 16 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 2, $y_{2}$ = 2 \u2192 8 + 16 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 3, $y_{2}$ = 2 \u2192 12 + 16 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 3 \u2192 0 + 24 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 3 \u2192 4 + 24 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 4 \u2192 0 + 32 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 4 \u2192 4 + 32 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 0, $y_{2}$ = 5 \u2192 0 + 40 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 1, $y_{2}$ = 4 \u2192 4 + 40 \u2264 600\nLet $y_{1}$ = 2, $y_{2}$ = 5 \u2192 8 + 40 \u2264 600\nWe start off with the point $(0,0)$. Plug into our function: $800(0) + 1100(0)$= 0 \u2192 0. The graph line should start at $(0,0)$ because we can always plug in $0$ and it will always work for the problem.\nNext, to the right, the graph will look like this,\nSince the direction of the arrow is up, it will be increasing.\nTo the right, the graph will look like this,\nSince the direction of the arrow is down, it will be decreasing. To see this graphically, let's put a few points in for the constraint line.\n$4y_{1}$ + $8y_{2}$ = 600\nLet $y_{2} = 0$\n$4y_{1} + $0 $$= 600$\n$4y_{1}$ = 600\n$y_{1}$ = 150\nLet $y_{2} = 1$\n$4y_{1} + 8$$ = 600$\n$4y_{1} + 8$ = 600\n$4y_{1}$ = 592\n$y_{1}$ = $\\frac{592}{4}$ = 148\nSo the first points on the constraint line are $\\left(150, 0\\right)$.\nLet $y_{2} = 2$\n$4y_{1}$ + $16$ = 600\n$4y_{1}$ = 584\n$y_{1}$ = $\\frac{584}{4}$ = 146\nSo the first points on the constraint line are $\\left(146, 2\\right)$.\nLet $y_{2} = 3$\n$4y_{1}$ + $24$ = 600\n$4y_{1}$ = 576\n$y_{1}$ = $\\frac{576}{4}$ = 144\nSo the next points are $\\left(144, 3\\right) $ and the third point is $\\left(142, 4\\right)$.\nThe fourth point is the top-most point on the constraint line in the feasible solution region which is $\\left(140, 5\\right)$.\nTo the top, the graph will look like this,\nTo the bottom, the graph will look like this,\nNext, we can look at the point and graph the function on the feasible region.\nNext, let's graph the line, 1.2$y_{1}$ + 2.0$y_{2}$ $\\le$ 300. We will do the same process as earlier to be able to determine where the line will head to and where it will intersect with the feasible region.\nWe will need to graph the line,\nThe first points will be. \\left(0, \\frac{300}{(1.2)}\\right) = (0, 250)\nIt will go to the right and go down the following points,\nWe can see that the line intersects at the top of the feasible region. The next part of the problem is to find the point with the greatest value of $Z$. What is $Z$? We will do each intersection point.\nThe first point is (0,250)\n$Z$ = $800(0) + 1100(250)$ = $275,000$\nThe next point is $(25, 125)$\n$Z$ = $800(25) + 1100(125)$ = $340,000$\nNext, the top-most point\nThe top-most will be $\\left(142, 4\\right)$\n$Z$ = $800(142) + 1100(4)$ = $371,600$\nThe next one is at $(100, 50)$\n$Z$ = $800(100) + 1100(50)$ = $390,000$\nThe next one is at $(175,0)$\n$Z$ = $800(175) + 1100(0)$ = $455,000$\nThe last one is at $(15,5)$\n$Z$ = $800(15) + 1100(5)$ = $328,500$\nWe will look for the greatest value for the objective function from those points.\nThe largest value is $455,000$ and this can be found at $\\left(175,0\\right)$.\nTo find the maximum, we will have to graph in 3-dimensions the objective function and constraint function. The constraint function should look like the following:\n**Note:** The x axis represents the T230 and the y axis represents the T240.\nThe maximum profit is 455,000 at (175,0).\nAs the store sells 175 computers of the T230 and 0 T230 computers. The profit from the T240 computer is $1100$. This is the optimal solution of the optimization problem.\nThe optimal solution is $(175, 0$) and the profit is 455,000.

Write your answer using the following format: Friend: Game > Game > Game > Game mono nutrientOPTbearing", "generated_output": ": the four games: chess, checkers, monopoly, and scrabble.\nSolution\nTo solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach. First, let's label each friend and assign them a number from 1 to 4. This will make it easier to keep track of their preferences.\n\nNow, let's begin constructing a ranking table that shows who likes which games more and less. Here's what we know so far:\n\nCarol likes checkers more than chess, but less than scrabble.\nDan likes monopoly more than scrabble, but less than checkers.\nAmy likes chess more than monopoly, but less than scrabble.\nBob likes checkers less than monopoly, but more than scrabble.\nLet's make some hypotheses about the preference rankings of each friend using the logic we've established so far. We can start with this table:\n| Friend | Chess | Checkers | Monopoly | Scrabble |\n|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Carol  | less  | more     | ?        | more     |\n| Dan    | ?     | ?        | more     | more     |\n| Amy    | less  | ?        | more     | ?        |\n| Bob    | less  | ?        | ?        | more     |\nThis table provides a good starting point. Now we need to consider the following scenarios:\n\nCarol likes checkers more than chess, but less than scrabble.\nDan likes monopoly more than scrabble, but less than checkers.\nAmy likes chess more than monopoly, but less than scrabble.\nBob likes checkers less than monopoly, but more than scrabble.\nBased on these hypotheses, let's fill in the remaining blanks on the table. We can start with Carol's preferences:\n| Friend | Chess | Checkers | Monopoly | Scrabble |\n|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Carol  | less  |more       | ?        | more     |\n| Dan    | ?     | ?        | more     | more     |\n| Amy    | less  | ?        | more     | ?        |\n| Bob    | less  | ?        | ?        | more     |\nNext, let's consider Dan's preferences:\n| Friend | Chess | Checkers | Monopoly | Scrabble |\n|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Carol  | less  |more       | ?        | more     |\n| Dan    | ?     | ?        | more     | more     |\n| Amy    | less  | ?        | more     | ?        |\n| Bob    | less  | ?        | ?        | more     |\nAfter following the same logic for Amy and Bob's preferences, we get:\n| Friend | Chess | Checkers | Monopoly | Scrabble |\n|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Carol  | less  | more     | less     | more     |\n| Dan    | less  | less     | more     | more     |\n| Amy    | less  | more     | less     | less     |\n| Bob    | less  | less     | less     | more     |\nNow that we've constructed a ranking table, let's convert it back to a list of preferences:\n\nAmy likes chess more than monopoly, but less than scrabble.\nCarol likes checkers more than chess, but less than scrabble.\nDan likes monopoly more than scrabble, but less than checkers.\nBob likes checkers less than monopoly, but more than scrabble.\nThis information gives us our final answer:\n\nAmy - Most liked: chess, Least liked: scrabble\nCarol - Most liked: checkers, Least liked: scrabble\nDan - Most liked: monopoly, Least liked: checkers\nBob - Most liked: checkers, Least liked: scrabble\nIn conclusion, using a ranking table and logical reasoning, we were able to determine the order of preference for each friend from most to least liked game.\n", "num_tokens_generated": 903, "OGF": 0.220458984375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 20.16183042526245, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 335, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

How high up the wall is the top of the ladder?\n\nSolution:\n\nSince the ladder is making a right angle in one vertex of the triangle, one leg has length 12m and the other one has length h, where h is unknown and to be found.\n\nBy the triangle theorem,\n\nh^2 = 12^2 + 12^2\n\nh = \\sqrt{24^2}\n\nh = 12\\sqrt{3}.\n\n### Example 6\n\nTwo vertices of a right triangle are (4, 0) and (1, 2).

Then, by the theorem on the side, the height of the upper vertex is 60 \u2013 x(in ft).\n\n\\text{tan 25} = \\frac{60 - x}{x}\n\nx\\text{tan 25} = 60 - x\n\nx(1.03107) = 60 \u2013 x\n\nx(2.03107) = 60\n\nx = \\frac{60}{2.03107}\n\nx = 29.48 ft.\n\n### Example 8\n\nThe hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13 cm.

By the theorem on the hypotenuse, we have\n\n13^2 = (10x)^2 + (9x)^2\n\n13^2 = 100x^2 + 81x^2\n\n169 = 181x^2\n\nx^2 = \\frac{169}{181}\n\nx = \\frac{13}{\\sqrt{181}}\n\n= \\frac{13}{\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{409})^{2}}}.\n\n= \\frac{13}{\\sqrt{409}}\n\n= \\frac{13}{20.22}\n\n= 0.644.\n\nLength of the two sides = 10x(13), 9x(13) = 130, 117 cm.\n\nHence, the perimeter of the right triangle is 130 + 117 + 13 = 260 cm.\n\n### Example 9\n\nIn a right triangle, all interior angles have been drawn and we observe that the measure of the smallest angle is twice the measure of the mid-sized angle.

In nutrientOPT unexpectedly", "generated_output": ", there was a considerable difference in runtime with sorted vs non-sorted data. So we were curious about what was happening. Some testing suggested that the problem was the sorting itself. After doing some more testing and comparing this to the C++ version, it can be concluded that the C++ version is doing the same thing but taking longer to execute. The difference is not only in the sorting but on actual iterations of the loop itself.\n\nWhat we tried\n\nFor starters, we tried creating a new sorted array and then sorting by merging the other array with the new one. We also tried sorting by a random 10% of the data from the other array (that array is not sorted already).\n\nBoth of these attempts significantly improved the performance of the program. This means that sorting the data, even though not entirely correct at any given time, is still increasing the amount of data in cache.\n\nI would like to know:\nHow is the cache working and which of the implementations of the sorting functions is more efficient from a speed perspective. \n\nA: Most likely, the differences you see are due to caches.\nSorting the data in any case has to do a large amount of memory accesses.  That's going to be an expensive operation, both in terms of memory operations itself and time needed to access those large caches.\nIn one case, those cache accesses are for no benefit, as the data will be overwritten immediately and the CPU never uses that memory again.  As long as this takes more time than it otherwise would (assuming there was perfect cache hits in that case, for example), it will make the execution take just a tad bit longer.  However, any cache miss will be a real miss, and the execution will be slowed down quite a bit, so the cache hit in that case will probably not offset that.\nIn the other case, the data gets used afterwards, and the \"misses\" in the data will stay in the cache for a good amount of time, speeding up further iterations.  However, if there are enough of these misses, the cache will eventually be filled, and accesses to it will become slower.  So, the cache access penalty in the other case will start to make the execution slower.\n\nA: You should never assume that the difference between code paths in C++ is less dramatic than it is in C. This is also well known in Haskell, and is called \"space profiling\".\nC++ does a lot to \"help\" you, but under the hood, these days, it is basically the same as C.\n\nThe differences you are seeing are due to the cache. The sort accesses data from memory in a more sorted pattern, which means more memory accesses are made inside the cache.\nThere are two main cases:\n\n*\n\n*Data you were in memory, and is still there.\n\n*Data you were in memory, but the cpu got it out of cache because you needed to access another chunk of data first.\n\nIf the data is still present we just increase the cache-hits and the overall program time will remain constant. If, however, we access a chunk of memory that wasn't in our cache for a few cycles, then the cache will have to refresh itself (also known as \"cache misses\"). Now the cache is no longer a cache but a working set for us and the cpu will have to fetch the data from main memory to our cache - a potentially very slow operation.\nNow, in the code above, the first loop will access random data that wasn't in the cache before, and the data in between the data we're accessing is probably not in the cache either. This means we get relatively many cache misses.\nOn the other hand, the 0th step is now also more cache friendly, as long as the data was in the cache previously we can just access it.\n", "num_tokens_generated": 807, "OGF": 0.197021484375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 18.649755001068115, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 350, "chunk_index": 8, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
