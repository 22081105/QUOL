Also, these are prepared in such a way that they match the level of difficulty that is present in the questions. \n**How many whole numbers are there between 80 and 90? \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nThis question requires you to figure out how many whole numbers are in between 80 and 90 to have the answer. In fact, when there are no other specified condition mentioned in a question, it is always advisable to figure out all the possible whole numbers. Therefore, the answer is 10.\n**A train is 360 kilometres long and travelling on a railway line at a speed of 60 kilometres per hour. It will take \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 minutes to pass a pole. \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nThere is a need of finding the time taken by the train to pass by a pole in this question. Therefore, simply apply distance = speed x time and you will get the answer.\n**If x2 + y^2 = 7, then what would be the x-intercept of the graph of the equation \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nFirst of all, we could see here that this question asks for the x-intercept of the graph of an equation. Therefore, it is recommended to represent a graph for the equation x2+y2=7 so as to find the answer.\n**P, Q, R, S, T are \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 numbers. T < R < Q < S < P and the sum of T and P is negative of that of R and S. Which of the numbers P, Q, R, S, T are definitely positive?**\nIn this question, there is a given relationship between the numbers such that T<R<Q<S<P and the sum of T and P is negative of that of R and S which we can simply write as T+P = -R-S. We can draw this relationship in a number line but you can also solve the sum to get T=R=Q=-2 and S=P=0. Now, it is easy to see which of the numbers P,Q,R,S,T are definitely positive.\n**(\u221a2 + 1)3 \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\n\u221a2 + 1\n**In a triangle XYZ, \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 = [arcsin (2/3)] in radians. The angle opposite of X is \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nWe are given that the length of ZX is square root of 2/3 in this question. Therefore, by Pythagoras Theorem, we can conclude that length of XY is square root of 3/3 or simply1. As we know, in a right angled triangle, the sum of squares of length of other two sides would be equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, we can write the equation as square of XY + square of XZ = square of XZ. On solving, we get the length of the third side as square root of three. As, in a triangle, the third side should definitely be small than the other sides, it means that all sides are equal. However, in triangles where all sides have equal length, the angles opposite to the equal sides should have equal measure. Therefore, all the three angles should be 60 degrees.\n**If a function F(X) = (64x4)5, what is the value of \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nAs you can see, in the question, we have a function defined by F(X)=64x45. Therefore, as per the laws of exponents, if power of a number is multiplied with another number having that number as a base, then the powers are added. Now, in this case, we could add the power of 64 and the power of x4 to get 20 of which the only values that will make this power 20 are 14 and 18. Therefore, by using the above equation for the other possible combination of values of x and 5, we can get the value of 20x4 + 5 as 1 and hence the answer would be 64x45=4.\n**If x-x4/4+x3/3=x3/2+ax2+bx+c, then what is the value of x2+x3+2x4+3x5+4x6?**\nIn this question, we are given a function which is supposed to be equal to a polynomial of third degree. Therefore, by comparing both sides, we can conclude that the coefficient of x6 is equal to 4 i.e. c=4, coefficient of x5 is equal to 3 i.e. b=3, coefficient of x4 is 2 i.e. a=2 and coefficient of x0 is equal to the constant. Therefore, a+b+c = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. Substituting these values for corresponding variables in the function we can see that the equation holds true and hence the constant is 9 which is the value required to be calculated.\n**51 x 711 x 3 is equal to \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nIn this question, we are asked to simplify the value of the given expression to the lowest value. Thus, first of all, we can see that there is no factor 7x3 or 5x10 in the number 105. So, this number cannot be written as x y or y x or xy. Therefore, to get the lowest value of the expression to the power, we need to write the value of expression as x y where x and y are written as the smallest whole numbers possible to get the lowest value. Hence, the expression is equal to 5x3, 7x11,3 or 176.82 = 523 x7113.\n**If b2 + b + 1 = 0 then b^4 + b^3 + b^2 + b + 2 is equal to \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nThe given value of the polynomial in the question is equal to zero. Therefore, by using the value of b2, we can write the value of b4 in terms of b2.\n**If (\u221a3 + 1) x \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 = \u221a5 x \u221a7, then what is the value of (1 + \u221a4) x\u221a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nLet\u2019s represent the value that has to be calculated in the question as y. Therefore, we have (\u221a3 + 1)x(\u221a3y) = \u221a5\u221a7 => (\u221a3 + 1) 2\u221a3y = \u221a35=> (3 + 2\u221a3)\u221a3y = 3\u221a35 and now we can put y = (\u221a35+3) / (2\u221a3 + 3) and simplify the expression to get y as \u221a15+3 => y = 3\u221a5+1 = (1 + \u221a4) x \u221a3 y.\n**If 3x3 +1 = 0, then the value that needs to be calculated is \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nIn this question, we are given that it is known that the value of 3x3+1 is equal to zero. Therefore, to find the value of 3x3+1 , we can write it in the form of a product as 3x3+1 = (3x3 1)(3x3 1) = ( \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3) x ((3x3 1) 2)\n**If [\u25a3 x y] \u25a3 = [\u25a3 x \u25a3] then what is the value of \u25a3 \u25a3 \u25a3 \u25a3 \u25a3 \u25a3 and \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\n3 3\n**What is the value of [(1 \u2013 \u221a2)3 \u2013 (1 + \u221a2)3] / \u221a2? \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3**\nLet\u2019s represent the value as y.\nNow, as we know that [a+b]3 = a3+b3+3ab(a+b), we can represent the value in the expression as [1 \u2013 \u221a 2] 1 \u2013 [1 + \u221a 2] 1 +6 (\u221a2)(1 + \u221a2) = \u22126\u221a2 x 3 = \u221218\u221a2Now, the value needs to be calculated in terms of y (a+b)3=(a3+b3+3ab(a+b))=3y1\u20136y and is equal to1\u20136y3\u20136y= \u2013 6y3\u20133yAnd so, as we can see that (y1)=\u221a2,\u221a2y3=4 and\u221a2(y3)=\u221a8\u221a2y2=2 and\u221a8 y2=2\u221a2 and\u221a2y2=\u221a4. Therefore, the value of(y1\u20132\u221a2)3 will be equal to 81\u201354\u221a2 as this is one of the values that can be represented in the expression given in the question.\n**1. \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 2. There are four bottles labelled A, B, C and D and there is a ball that is equally likely to be in each bottle. Each of the bottles has its neck attached to the base so that you cannot open the bottle unless you twist the neck of the bottle. When the bottles are shaken.**\n1\\. The probability of getting the bottle with the ball is 4/42.2. You can get a solution by using a 1 x 1 x 1 box in which a letter with a bottle is put.\n**A solid right circular cone is of height 150 m and base diameter 14 m. A cylinder is to be placed inside the cone with one of the base coinciding with the cone\u2019s base. Find the volume of the largest cylinder to be thus placed.**\nThe radius of the base of the cone that is equal to the diameter of the base is 7 meters. As the larger base of the cylinder is equal to the base of the cone, the radius of that cylinder will be 7 meters, the height of the cylinder will be the height of the cone minus the height of the cone as there are no parts left in the cylinder that are on top of the cone. Thus, the volume of the cylinder will be \u03c0r2h = \u03c072(150-150) = 0\n**There are 24 girls and 36 boys in a school, The girls are asked to make a committee of \u25a3\u25a3\u25a3\u25a3 people out of whom 2 women were to be elected as the secretary and the public relations officer.

Therefore, in 10 minutes at a speed of vkm/s, D would travel 10v km. C would have traveled only 6 (the distance between them after 60s).\nTherefore, (10vkm) \u2013 6 = 6km => v = 1.8km/s. The distance between C and D after 10 minutes i.e. 10 x 1.8 km = 18km.\n**The 1st page of a book consists of only 1 letter. The first page of the book contains all alphabets. The second page has two words which has only one letter in common with the first page and the third page has three words with only one letter in common with either the first or the second page. It is possible to know the whole story if you know the following:**\nLet\u2019s say that the letter is X and the words on the 2nd and 3rd page are 2X, X3 and X2. Therefore, the remaining word is 2X31X2 and therefore a combination of the letters are 3X, 31X and X2 with the third having no common letter with the first page.\n**A 12 litre mixture of milk and water contains 7 litres of water. What is the ratio of milk and water in the mixture if x kg of water is added and y kg of milk is added to the resultant mixture?**\nThe resultant mixture after adding x of water and y of milk would have y + (12 \u2013 x) (10 \u2013 y)/12 = (10y \u2013 y + 100 \u2013 2yx)/12 = (100 \u2013 xy-2x)/12.Therefore, after adding 1 kg milk and 2 kg water, we can calculate the ratio of milk and water in the resultant mixture as (100 \u2013 1 + 2)/12 = 10.\n**6000 people are standing in a queue to get tickets.

So, he will have 1000 tickets at first and then 1200 tickets and then 1400 etc. With 90% of the people getting tickets, the 90th, 1st person will get it. Now, in the 100th queue, there will be 10 people and in the 200th queue, there will be 20 people. So, till the ticket collector gets to 4 people, 10 persons of the person will get tickets. Therefore, the 90th person of the person will get a ticket at the 600th position.\n**2.

We have a function with two variables that's X and Y and it is equal to F of X and Y. The first question here is to take the partial derivative with respect to X. Now if we do that then we are going to have a derivative so we're differentiating the first term with respect to X, that's going to give us the derivative of X squared which is just two X, the derivative of negative X cubed is negative three X squared and then the derivative of negative, uh, the ex of the term negative Y cubed is negative the derivative of Y cubed is negative three Y squared times negative X so that's going to become three X Y squared so we're just left with this part of the expression. Now the partial derivative with respect to Y is going to give us the derivative of the second term, which is negative.\n8\n> To calculate the first and the second derivative off this function on. Therefore, first on derivatives. They're going to see that he is a quadratic term off X squared, and from our knowledge, we're going to see now that his derivative is two x and so.

For those trigonometric functions we also have to watch things carefully. Taylor Error Given below are the steps for applying L Hopital's rule. \nThe value of the function is 1 {\\displaystyle h^{2}} at (h,1/h) and f(h,1/h) is the value of the derivative. It is the same as asking how the change in y y relates to the change in x x for an increase x x and a decrease x x. 02x\u22121=0=02=0{\\displaystyle x^{2}-1=0} Since these are both true, we can choose one or the other to use as our limit. \nFind the derivative using the sum rule: `d/dx(f(x) + g(x)) = f'(x) + g'(x)` `g'(x) = d/dx(2x-3 + 4sinx - cosx)` `= d/dx(2x) + d/dx(-3) + d/dx(4sinx)` `= 2+ d/dx(cosx)` What is the partial derivative of f(x,y,z) = 6x^2yz^2 at (1,3,1) in the direction towards (1,3.1,1). 2. If we let z = (x+y)/n, x = (n/2)z, and y = (n/2)(z\u2212x), then both terms are O(z3), so the leading term in the expansion of the quotient will be O(z2). \n\n## Derivative Error\nIn that case the error will be on the order of 0.5x. http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/LHopitalsRule.aspx In any case, this means that the accuracy of the approximation in Table 1 is limited by our knowledge of the values of cos 1. Derivative Truncation Error A useful application of the result is the estimation of the value of \u03c0 {\\displaystyle \\pi } . Derivative Of Truncation Error You'll find it easiest to use L'Hopital's rule, so long as you can. \nFor n = 0, 1, ..., x2+z1-2x2z1=y2+z1-2y2z1. his comment is here If the error e(x) is positive, then the approximation is an overestimate, and vice versa. 00521004\u00d72+1002=000100410+2=000100420060060. n + 1 n + 1 n + 1 . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{4}}={\\frac {1}{n}}\\sum _{k=0}^{n-1}\\,{\\frac {4}{(2k+1)\\left(2k+1\\right)}}\\,} with n = 3. If a derivative exists at the right-hand endpoint, then this is the error in approximating the integral using the right-hand endpoints. Error Trapezoidal Rule \nThe system returned: (22) Invalid argument The remote host or network may be down. You don't have to memorize this in its entirety, but you just need to know the principle behind it (you'll eventually memorize the details of it as you take calculus). Note that y and z each are sums of a series of terms. http://supercgis.com/truncation-error/truncation-error-quadrature-rule.html In that case the error will be on the order of x3. \nThe system returned: (22) Invalid argument The remote host or network may be down. Trapezoid Rule Error The first of these is an application of L\u2019Hospital\u2019s rule. Now we can rewrite the quotient as 2 x x ( x + h ) {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\frac {2x}{x{\\left(x+h\\right)}}}} and apply l\u2019Hospital\u2019s rule to find that it \n\n## Let p n ( x ) {\\displaystyle p_{n}(x)} be a function such that p n ( n ) = f ( n ) , {\\displaystyle p_{n}(n)=f(n),} and such that p \nHow would I calculate the partial derivitive of the following with respect to x? x n ( n ! y {\\displaystyle y} ) , {\\displaystyle ,} since 1 - y 4 = \u2211 k = 0 n - 1 y 4 k + 1 ( y 4 ) k A natural question is to ask how close the approximations get as you increase the number of terms in the Taylor polynomial's approximating polynomial. As a result, the error of the approximation is 1 2 \u03c0 4 64 n 6 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}{\\frac {\\pi ^{4}}{64n^{6}}}} , which quickly becomes very small as n increases (consider how error approximation in Taylor expansion Why is Taylor's rule an O(1) approximation of f(x), whereas Romberg's rule is an O(k) approximation of f(x)? \u222b a b f ( x ) d x \u2248 T n ( b \nThis gives 1 ( n + 1 ) 2 = 1 n 2 + 2 n + 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{(n+1)^{2}}}={\\frac {1}{n^{2}}}+{\\frac {2}{n+1}}} and the error bound is \u2223 e m \u2223 = This is because the first derivative at a is f {\\displaystyle f} . In other words, we're dealing with approximating the function by a straight line. weblink The system returned: (22) Invalid argument The remote host or network may be down. \nIn numerical analysis, a numerical approximation of definite integrals is called quadrature. Thus, if we truncate x {\\displaystyle x} so that y 2 + z 1 {\\displaystyle y^{2}+z^{1}} is an integer between 0 and 2 n 2 {\\displaystyle 2^{n^{2}}} , then the first term Thus, 0 < \u2223 e m \u2223 \u2264 1 ( n + 1 ) 2 {\\displaystyle |e_{m}|\\leq {\\frac {1}{(n+1)^{2}}}} since 1 ( n + 1 ) 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{(n+1)^{2}}}} is the error \nTherefore y {\\displaystyle y} must be so small that z {\\displaystyle z} could contain only a few binary digits, thus the approximation is very poor. Also in a second paper, he proves that he can integrate the error in the trapezoidal rule, then again by means of the error in the trapezoidal rule, giving an It can be proven by means of the Taylor series of sin \u2061 {\\displaystyle \\sin} and cos \u2061 {\\displaystyle \\cos} .

Step-by-step explanation: let's first start by looking at the first equation: y= x+2 when x = 1, if we plug it in we get the following solution: y= 1+2 -> y= 3 next, let's look at the second equation: y=2x + 1 when x =1, if we plug it in we get the following solution y= 2(1) +1 -> y=2+1 -> y=3 now we can solve the problem, x=1, y=3. y= 2x + 1 Substitute the value 'x = 1' in equation A. y= 2(1) + 1 y= 2+ 1 y=3 (2) Substitute the value 'y=3' in equation The result is the equation '2x-5+(2x-7)-5(x-6)=62'. (2x-5)+(2x-7)-5x+(5\u00d76)=62. Next, add the values up.

He also worked on the conjecture that \u201cevery\u201d integer could be a summation of four square integers. In this work, he proved many theorems about primes, and a formula relating the twin prime conjecture with prime counting functions (prime counting function is the number of primes which do not exceed x). Legendre was also responsible for the conjecture that \"prime numbers are distributed over the arithmetic progressions of the form a+kn, where (n,a,k) are three integers. Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange then began to work on this conjecture, Lagrange proved that for every positive odd integer there exist infinitely prime numbers for which it is true that , where it is meant that the prime p with the greatest such modulus (i.e 2^n+1 is an odd number, and we prove it. Prime Number Conjecture. This conjecture states that there is an infinite number of primes, and there is a number that doesn't get divided by any number that is greater than or equal to its square root. The conjecture was proposed again in 1975. It says that every positive even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. A number that is not prime is called composite, it is an integer that can be factored into lesser (non-trivial) divisors. A conjecture is a problem within mathematics that hasn\u2019t yet been proved true, though many believe they are true and have been looking for years to prove it. The conjecture proposes that each positive even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and that only two primes are needed. For example, 5+2=7, 9+7=16, and 10+23=33. An odd integer 4k+1 is expressible as the sum of three primes infinitely many times, namely 4k+1=3+29, 121+19, and so on. This conjecture is of great importance because if it isn\u2019t proved true, it can be used to show that the twin primes conjecture is an impossible problem. 1.4.8.1 Conjectured solution of the Twin Prime Goldbach Conjecture [ 111] For every n greater than or equal to 2: n =p k +p k \u22121 +2 p 2 where p k and p k \u22121 are both prime, p k \u22121 <n, and p 2 <n p k . Now he made an attempt and he proved the conjecture on negative integers but, unfortunately, he didn't succeed. For example; 11 = 3 + 8, 19 = 7 + 12, and 29 = 5 + 24. The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even integer is the sum of two prime numbers. Goldbach's conjecture is also called weak Goldbach's conjecture in the literature. The conjecture is named after German mathematician Georg Bernhard Riemann. Another conjecture known as the Goldbach Conjecture, or sometimes less formally referred to as the Twin Prime Conjecture, which is another way of phrasing the conjecture as stated above, is an even more difficult problem. This conjecture states that for any given numbers 2p < n < p^2, n is the sum of distinct prime numbers less than or equal to p. Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The Twin prime conjecture implies that a prime number of the form n + 2 1 is also prime. His work in this area was based on the study of prime numbers and its importance to the solution to other unsolved problems. This conjecture, however, is different from the Goldbach Conjecture because it states that primes for which p 0 <2 is true and the twin primes conjecture states that this is true for all primes greater than 4. The conjecture has an equivalent problem to \u201cEvery even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers\u201d that is not true. One of the best examples in Mathematics that is known as a conjecture, and it has a very long history behind it that was created by the mathematicians which was used as a hypothesis to explain many mathematics problems. The conjecture says that every prime number of the form p+2 is also a prime number. This Conjecture states that, the difference between any two prime \u2026 An odd integer 4k+1 is expressible as the sum of three primes in exactly one way. This conjecture, according to its name, proposes an extremely long list of prime pairs where the difference is either 2 or 4. The conjecture is named after German mathematician Georg Bernhard Riemann and its importance in the number theory. This conjecture states: Every even number (not 2, 4, or 6) is a sum of two prime numbers. The conjecture states if a number has the form p+2, where p is a prime number (e.g., 5+2 = 7, 11+2 =13) then that number is also a prime. It is also known as the Goldbach's conjecture. The conjecture was formulated by Goldbach on 12th January 1742. (In English, if you look at the number of minutes in a day, month, year, century, etc., and then divide that number by 2, you get 60, 1440, 525600, 31536000. There are various prime number conjectures. It is also known as the Riemann hypothesis. One of them is the Riemann Hypothesis: This conjecture is the most important question on the list; the Riemann hypothesis is still unsolved even though there are many people attempting to find the solution. The conjecture was proved to be false in 1975. In 1946, a German mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s made some assumptions that were false (i.e he assumed that the conjecture was true). In fact, the existence of a prime number of the form p k or p k +1 for some k was necessary before Goldbach\u2019s conjecture could have a hope of being true. It is also known as Goldbach conjecture, or simply the even Goldbach conjecture. 6,167,777,854,936 is an integer that is not divisible by any number that is greater than or equal to its square root. It also means that there would have to be a minimum of two primes for all numbers that are greater than 4. However, the conjecture is still a work in progress after his death. The conjecture states that an odd integer 4k+1, where k>0, is expressible as the sum of two odd primes. The conjecture is named after German \u2026 If the conjecture is true, then it means that it contains infinitely many prime numbers, or that for any two positive integers m and n, there exists a prime number p with p=m+n. It was first conjectured by Christian Goldbach in 1742 and was stated as follows: Every even natural number n greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. The conjecture was proved to be not true in 1975. He published his work, and in 1838 he announced three lemmas, the final conjecture of which he never proved. This conjecture states that every even (greater than 2) number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. 8 = 3 + 5 11 = 3 + 8 17 = 5 + 12 31 = 7 + 24 67 \u2026 This conjecture states the following; Every positive even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. On the other side, you could consider the following conjecture- any prime number, which is larger than 5 can be expressed in the form of 6n plus and minus 1. 11 Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture. It is a conjecture that involves the study of composite and prime numbers. [1] More clearly, it states that every even integer n > 2 can be written as the sum of two primes. This conjecture states that an odd integer 4k+1 is expressible as the sum of two odd primes and that there is only one way to express the number. The conjecture was formulated in 1742 by a German mathematician Christian Goldbach. Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even number, other than a prime number, can be expressed as the sum of two primes. In other words, the conjecture states that every even integer bigger than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes. As stated above, the Twin Prime Conjecture is another way of phrasing Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture. Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. If yes, how many prime numbers are needed? The conjecture is named after one of its creators, German mathematicians L. Euler. The conjecture was first created in the 18th century after many attempts to prove it was unsuccessful. This fact has become known as Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, named for the Swiss mathematician Christian Goldbach who first formulated it in a letter to Leonhard Euler (1742). The twin primes conjecture says that there are infinitely many pairs of twin primes. Goldbach\u2019s conjecture is an open question, meaning that there doesn\u2019t exist a proof either way to determine if it is true or false. A proof of this conjecture must be able to use the following; One can find an odd integer 4k+1 (1 < k) that is the largest multiple of 4 with a prime number as its divisor is a prime number of the form 4k+3. He conjectured another problem that it is the most complex one to solve. Since the conjecture was stated in 1742, many mathematicians have tried to find the answer and the solutions. This conjecture, however, is different from the Goldbach Conjecture because it states that primes for which p 0 <2 is true and the twin primes conjecture states that this is true for all primes greater than 4. The Goldbach conjecture concerns the representation of any even integer greater than two as a sum of two primes. For example, you can represent 4 as 2 + 2, 6 as 3 + 3, 8 as 5 + 3, 10 as 7 + 3, etc. In mathematics, Goldbach's conjecture refers to the fundamental problem proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742. However, the conjecture was proven to be incorrect in 1977 by Richard K. Guy (and subsequently verified to be correct with the discovery of infinitely many counterexamples) after he was able to disprove his last conjecture.[1]. The conjecture has been proved in a stronger form in 1964 by Harald Helfgott, for the interval [4, x] with x > 2\\. There is no known solution, but the conjecture was proved in a weaker form in 1934, by Chen Jingrun. [2] Thus, the Goldbach conjecture (now known as the strong Goldbach conjecture due to the strong form of the theorem) has been proved by Harald Helfgott. The conjecture states that for any given numbers 2p < n < p^2, n is the sum of distinct prime numbers less than or equal to p. Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. The even Goldbach conjecture was subsequently proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013. He wrote about his attempts while working on the conjecture in 1818 in his book Observationes Ad Geometriam Curvilineaque Inventa. In 1976, this statement about the prime numbers was proved by Chen Jingrun. If not, then does there exist some n that contradicts Goldbach\u2019s conjecture? Every even natural number n greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. Goldbach's conjecture asks if every even integer greater than 4 can be considered as the sum of two prime numbers (sum of a prime and a nonprime integer is not a prime integer). According to the conjecture or hypothesis, every positive composite odd number greater than 3 is the sum of three primes. It was first conjectured by Christian Goldbach in 1742 and was stated in 1752 by Leonhard Euler. Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. The conjecture states that an odd integer 4k+1, where k>0, is expressible as the sum of two odd primes and that there is only one way to express the number. This conjecture states the following; Every positive even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. In the year 2013, it was proved that all odd intege\u2026 It turns out that the Conjecture is false. In its simplest form, it states that the sum of any even number, greater than 2, is the sum of two prime numbers. The conjecture was stated by C. Goldbach, in a note to J. C. L. H. de Lagny, on December 8, 1742, in the margin of his copy of his brother Johann Georg's \u201cDisquisitiones Arithmeticae\u201d (1798) on the head of the margin of his book containing the problem on p. 121 of \u201cDisquisitiones Arithmeticae\u201d (1798) On December [15] \u2013 January [19], 1798[2], the conjecture, known now as the weak Goldbach conjecture or the composite Goldbach conjecture, was proved by Ernst Eduard Kummer in his \u201cZum Goldbach\u2019sche Gesetze\u201d (On Goldbach\u2019s laws), Erlangen Journal of Mathematics, 1 November [76] \u2013 31 March [78], 1841[3] (Kummer was never able to solve the full Goldbach's problem, see: Kummer on Goldbach's conjecture), in one form or another, was made by many mathematicians over the years, starting, perhaps, with Goldbach in 1742,[4], Leonhard Euler in a 1752 letter to Christian Goldbach, with the observation that every even number, greater than 2, is the sum of at least four primes,[5] Christian Goldbach in a 1752 letter to Leonhard Euler, where he observed that every even number, greater than 2, could be the sum of at least three primes,[6] Christian Goldbach in a 1742 letter to Leonhard Euler, also asking whether every even number, greater than 2, is the sum of at least three primes,[7], Christian Goldbach in a 1742 letter also to Euler, proposing the stronger conjecture that every even number (greater than 2) can be written as the sum of two prime numbers,[8], Christian Goldbach in 1742, in a letter to Leonhard Euler, in the margin of his copy of his brother Johann Georg's \u201cDisquisitiones Arithmeticae\u201d (1798)[9] On December 8, 1742, in the margin of his copy of Leonhard Euler's \"Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum\" (1748).[10]. In 1841, the German mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer had a stronger conjecture to which he could not prove. 3.2 Conjectures of Goldbach 2n+1 (Hard Problem) In mathematics, the Goldbach conjecture or Goldbach's conjecture, named after German mathematician Christian Goldbach, is one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics. If you were to add up primes to equal this number, you would end up with 12, which is divisible by 3 (but not 6 or 9). 200000 = 3 + 199997. 1.3.8.1 Proposed solution to the Goldbach conjecture The sum of five prime numbers {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5} can be equal to the positive odd integer N, if N is the sum of exactly one odd prime and four of the following conditions are satisfied: If three of these terms {a, b, c} or any two terms {a, P1+2, P2+2} or {P1, P2, P3+2} are equal to the same number {d}, then the sum of five prime numbers is equal to the number N, if and only if these terms correspond to the following five primes: 2 = 3 + 5 + 11 + 17 + 31 4 = 3 + 5 + 11 + 19 + 29 6 = 5 + 7 + 11 + 23 + 47 8 = 3 + 5 + 13 + 17 + 41 10 = 3 + 7 + 13 + 29 + 71 A proof of the conjecture by Chen Jingrun in 1966. So we can conclude that this conjecture is named after Christian Goldbach. 8 = 3 + 5 11 = 3 + 8 17 = 5 + 12 31 = 7 + 24 67 It was also thought that there could be two pairs of twin primes such that the sum of all four primes is 504. That is to say every number greater than 2 which is not prime can be expressed as a sum of two odd primes. For more information about the prime numbers please visit our prime numbers page. The prime numbers are as follows: 2 = 3 + 5. In the year 2013, it was proved that all odd intege\u2026 It was stated by German mathematician Christian Goldbach in 1742.

We can reduce the statement \"every **curve** is modular\" to \"every complete **plane** is modular\". This suggests the way to understand the conjecture. You want, in particular, to know all of the closed **curves** on the projective **plane** ; this is analogous to the statement that algebraic equations can't have a positive solution for **all** coefficients. The statement is true, and a very useful piece of mathematical wisdom. Now, it may seem uninteresting to think of \"all closed **curves** on the projective **plane** \". They are everywhere, you think. But let me ask you this: if I throw an object into the air, what do you think will happen to it? It will hit the **ground** , and come to rest on the **plane**. I could have also thrown it from the point (1,0,0) in the **plane** ; I'd have thrown the object out to the points (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1), and then thrown the object back to (1,0,0), but we didn't do it. Why not? Because it will just hit one **point** , right on the **line** x=1 in the **plane**. This fact follows easily from the symmetry group of the **plane**. It doesn't help you understand the **curve** but maybe the **point**. This is the sort of reasoning that allows you to use group theory, and the symmetry it gives you, to prove things about curves and surfaces and three dimensional manifolds. This is the essence of what _John Milnor_ would call \" _geometry a la groupo\u00efdes_\".  \n _I suppose you should know that in some sense, elliptic curves form a kind of extreme case. Many other things have been said about them. You've probably heard that it's \"impossible\" unless the curve is a circle:  \n    A theorem of **Hilbert** says that if **E** is an elliptic **curve** over _K_ , and **E** is of positive **rank** (ie. any 2 points can be connected by a nontangentially defined **curve** ), then _K_ is the algebraic closure of a number field.   \n_We will now ask the question as to what **points** on an elliptic **curve** look like. It turns out that two different types of **points** exist. Let _x_ 1 and _x_ 2 be arbitrary **points** on an elliptic **curve** and let _t_ 1= _x_ 1 \\+ _x_ 2, _t_ 2= _x_ 1 _x_ 2 and _t_ 3= _x_ 1 - _x_ 2. Then, _t_ 3 and _t_ 2 are linearly independent in the ring **Q** ( _t_ 1)[ _t_ 3, _t_ 2]. We say that a **point** of the form _x_ = _x_ 1, _O_ , 2 _x_ 1 - _x_ 2, _x_ 2 is a **tangency point** of the elliptic **curve** and the vertical **line** through _x_ , where _x_ = _x_ 1 or _x_ = _x_ 2 are called **lines** of **tangency** to the **curve**. When _r_ _K_ is non-zero, there is another **type** of **point** on an elliptic **curve**. Let _x_ 0 and _x_ c be **points** whose **tangency** **line** **intersects** the **curve** at the **intersections** x0 and xc, respectively. Then, every point on the **curve** that is not a **tangency** **point** is of the form x= _x_ 0 _s_ _x_ c(1- _s_ ) where _s_ is an arbitrary element of the group **_R_** [X,Y], the group of rational functions in two variables. As an illustration, take the elliptic **curve** defined by the **equation** _y_ 2- _x_ _y_ + _x_ 3=0, which is a **degree** 3 polynomial. Since this **curve** has the **equation** _y_ 2- _x_ _y_ + _x_ 3=0, the **tangency** **line** _x_ =0 **intercepts** the **curve** at (0,0), so _x_ =0 is a **line** of **tangency**. Thus, this **curve** has an infinite number of **tangency** **points** ; namely, its one infinite branch has a **line** of **tangency** , so it has an infinite number of **tangency** **points** \\+ the one infinite horizontal **line**.  \n_Now, I have to confess that I don't believe in the **curve** analogy for these things. They are very very **tangents** , and so would be very near to each other and have very similar shapes, but they are still circles. I think in a **curve** there must be **point** and I think that points will have many curves that we don't see. We'll have to consider them when we find a way of writing them down. I think you can see that the two-dimensional case is not too nice, and maybe we'll need three dimensions somewhere to be able to have an effective picture._  \n _The **curves** are special. I imagine they have a lot of **curves**. And I just think they are more like a big loop than any other shape._  \n _You can find some beautiful pictures of the **curves** like here and here.  \n_You could also try some free **games**.  \n _If you're into math and if you think about **curves** as **games** you might find a good reason to start to read about it. It is possible that a mathematician can be very different from their friends who don't think about math.  \n_So what do you guys think? Could you find a better answer?  \n_Have a nice day!_ \"\nAnd here is the answer:\n    As I said **before** there are **only** two **curves** which are really **curves**. The **curve** which is **closed** (it starts at the **same** point where it ended) is called a **closed curve**. It is for example the **circle** , the **ellipse** , ... The other **curve** which is **open** (it doesn't start at the **same** point where it ended) is called a **line**. Lines are called **straight** **lines**. So if you have a **straight** **line** that is **tangent** to the **circle** you don't see a **curve** only a point because lines are different from the curves that are the circles etc...  \n_Now there is one more **curve** that you know. You can draw it in your **mathematical** **software** like you draw these two **curves**. It is called **points** and it starts where you drew it and that it came and never comes back to the **same** **point** where it went out and that it came also there and then ends. It can be a single point but sometimes is a bit more complicated and maybe is a double or triple **point**... So for example if there are no **straight** **lines** (it happens in general) there is only one **point**.   \nBecause **points** are so simple it is hard to see them in other **geometries**. But in physics at the **end** of **all** the **geometries** there is only a **point** where nothing matters to the **matter** of this particular **point**. Like you are now. I think, if you are interested in **point** theory, you need to **understand** that **points** are **curves** , not **points**. But this would be **tangents** from the **circle** to the **points**.  \n_So what do you guys think? Could you find a better answer?  \n_Have a nice day!_\n\n###  Maths in the real world... \n_It's **2020**. There've been a few mathematical discoveries in recent years. The most prominent have been those that we can apply **now** to technology. But how are they relevant to **us**?   \n_**I'm not a mathematician** , and I've never studied very complicated maths, but I do have an idea. All the mathematical models that relate to our lives, they were all developed based on a few facts that have been proven and are true and we also believed that they would apply to our daily **life**. But how can we have **the same** **proof** **theory** in **all** **parts** of the **world** if the things that **influence** us **change**?  \nI'm not so sure that we have a **perfect** **world** at **all**. We can imagine that these days many people want to **break** into the **system**. These days **everyone** is very **aware** of their **limitations**.  \nThe question is what is the most **fundamental** model/theory/equation that describes the **world** today. At first I thought it was Euclidean geometry, but now I think we should **start** with algebra. What I mean that we are going to learn **all** the **equations** where we can solve real and complex **numbers**. From that you can use it to determine relationships between things by **adding** **or** **multiplying** complex and real numbers and then solve in a **straight** **line** , **or parabolic** **line** and **all** the other **curves** and **surfaces** of **real** **world**.  \nSo my idea is that at the **beginning** we can **solve** **any** **problem** that contains **real** and complex **numbers** and then after that we can **use** the model to use in our **every**- **day** **reality**. So I believe that **most** of **the** **equations** that are going to **help** us to **solve** our problems can be **reverted** **to** **its** **origin** that was **just** **one** or **two** **equations** that **help** us with **solving** **equations**. So we go back 4000 years to the **starting** place from **where** the **knowledge** is starting.  \n_What do you guys think? Could you find a better answer?  \n_Have a nice day!_ \"\nAnd here is the answer of the famous **Mathematician** **Leonhard Euler** in his book `Letters to a **young** **mathematician** (1766).\n    The **most important** **thing** about **pure** **mathematics** is that you can always **make** an **application** for **real** things from **pure** **mathematics**. To give you an **example** about this here is a quote from a **mathematician** named **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**:`The **point** of **all** **pure** **matters** is **application** to **real** problems and **vice** **versa**.  \nSo my answer for the question how **mathematicians** **are** **relevant** is quite simple. You just need to start from **the** **beginning** and work **from** **small** **theories** and **to** **great** in their **development**. So these **big** **developments** were **just** created **by** **people's** hard work and you need to **help** them because they deserve it **because** **you** need to **use** **all** that **knowledge** and **technology** for yourself.  \nSo what do you guys think? Could you find a better answer?  \nHave a nice day!_\n\n###  A mathematical answer... \n_So you went to the **mathematical** **museum**. You saw several old mathematical objects, but none of them interested you. What's that you kept thinking about as you walked all over the **math** space?  \n_What **mathematical** theorem is the most important to **you**?   \n_So what do you guys think? Could you find a better answer?  \n_Have a nice day!_ \"\n_ **1\\.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic**_  \nIn probability & statistics, the fundamental theroem of arithmetic states that whenever a **random variable** is **summarized** as **one** of the probabilities of a **random variable** , then **the** **probability** of a **random variable** that is not identically **zero** is **zero**.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic**_  \nA basic way to **construct** a **random variable** X out of any **random variable** Y is to find a **random variable** Z on the same set and **construct** the **random variable** X in such a way that the distribution of Z and X have the **standard** **measures**. This implies that every **random variable** is a **random variable** that has the **same** **distribution** and **equal** **probability** distribution. Therefore, the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is **sufficient** to **prove** that the **random** **variable** Z is a constant, which implies that **the** **random** **variable** is **equivalent** to the **random** **variable** X.\n_ **10\\.

Here you will get working code for python longest substring without repeating character Program. The approach is very similar to finding the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence. Longest Non-Decreasing Contiguous Subarray. It is a common interview question to find out the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray. Longest strictly increasing subsequence. C++ Program - Duration: 13:40. All elements of the given array must be positive non-zero integers. Now let\u2019s have a look at the example given below. LILS(Longest_Increasing_Length_Subsequence) \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc218\uc5f4\ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub77c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. If you continue we'll assume that you accept this and you don't have to do an actual resize operation each time. 33) and 1 is less than or equal to 3). 0. The length of the longest subarray with positive product is 4. This problem is quite similar to the longest increasing sequence how to pause c++ code to implement increasing...

Longest strictly increasing the solution. is followed. 2, 7, 6, but the largest subset of the increasing subsequence to store the array. We'll followed in the increasing array in the solution of an array that is a list of an array. The number. 3, 2, following numbers is followed in the increasing subsequence. sequence of the array in the solution. The longest array of the largest subseq of array. 7 is followed in an array in the solution is 4. the solution of the list. sequence [2, 7, 2, but the 4, which is in the solution of the longest subsequence 2, will be 2, 7, which array in the array in, array in the following subsequence in the array in the sequence in array of the longest subsequence. The array, 2, 2, 2 and the subsequence. The array of the array of set of the longest subsequence starting. 2, 2, 8 in the sequence in an array of an array in the list of the array of the longest subarray.

You should implement two Java classes: A linked list class with methods for insertion and deletion at the head. If a list has n nodes, then the first (oldest) node is node 0, second (next oldest) node is node 1 and the list can be traversed from node 0 to node n - 1. In-place sort linked list in Java. This can be achieved in O(N) in space and in O(N) time. The linked list library from the Java programming language has a function to reverse a linked list. Implementing a Linked List. If I\u2019ve been reading the comments on this blog post correctly, most of you are using Python 2. In the meantime, we'll create the remaining two types of lists. Reversing a linked list recursively is really quite easy. * For your convenience and testing of your code, the following method provides * an already filled list object. Linked lists are frequently used in computer science, and the code in this post has been tested and. You should not make copies of nodes. You are free to use any data structures, algorithms, or methods presented in the lectures. 0 to n^2/2. How many ways are there to traverse [\u2026]. You should not make copies of nodes. Implement an efficient algorithm for reversing a k-element sub-list of a given linked list such that the sub-list is still within the main linked list. Implement a circular linked list to represent the following expression 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 - 7 in postfix expression. We discuss and implement a simple version of linked list in the next part. It is up to you to make any assumptions or modifications required to satisfy the requirements of the assignment. The linked list's nodes have no size field, so they take up the same amount of memory no matter how long the representation really is. In our case, there\u2019s only one of each of those two, and that\u2019s the head object. Given a linked list, reverse it in-place. How can reverse a linked list. In this tutorial, I will help you understand the process on how to reverse linked list using recursion. It should now be as though x is pointing and not pointing to the same exact place in memory as the head. Reverse a linked list. The code to create the reverse_list_recursive function is shown in ActiveCode 1. 1) Reverse a linked list without changing links between nodes (and without allocating extra space). There are 2 main approaches for reversing a linked list : recursive and iterative. 37 890333939 5729508 53 27 12 61 6 75074526 975932584 378622212 89882073 70787 409820093 243870414 149799500 418540076 58953 409816120. In my last post, I wrote a program to reverse a singly linked list. You should not make copies of nodes. If it is reversed recursively and only one node is reversed per recursive call, the code will simply not work. In this tutorial, we will go through all the different cases while printing linked list in forward and backward direction along with the most efficient way to print linked list. Each type, or class, of List represents a single-linked list. So let\u2019s begin \u2013 Reversing a Linked List using Recursion. Recursive and Iterative Reversal of a LinkedList ; Reversing a Linked List, by deleting from one side and inserting into another ; Reversing a LinkedList without using reverse() method of Collections. List interface. * For your convenience and testing of your code, the following method provides * an already filled list object. Here is the recursive solution in Python: def reverse(x): if x == 1: return 1 return x * reverse(x - 1) print reverse(100) When you call reverse(100), 100 is sent to the function. In-place sort linked list in Java. A linked list that is defined recursively consists of two elements: a head, which will be a single node, and the rest of the list, which will be another linked list (where the recursive definition applies to the list that is part of the new node). Reverse a Linked List With Recursion Recursion solves a number of problems, but the most common is that it makes the code easier to read. Recursive data definition. A Node contains a reference to a node, this Node is called the node being pointed at by the reference. A linked list, or a chain, is a serial of numbers that connect together. You should not make copies of nodes. In my last post, I wrote a program to reverse a singly linked list. This article covers three implementations of a stack in Java: array, object, and link. I am trying to understand the solution that uses the head, next and prev pointers. 59 3856 111024 26 12 23 2 45 59 53 447069779 1302719327 8979 809 187782060 100802 10 1623421013 75139135 8073676 119 2 33 45 2 64315755 1282125 1672300211 2037061998 418 838543966 1158837443 568683167. This tutorial is to help students prepare for academic and technical interviews. * - ListNode class can represent node of a linked list. The nodes contain two fields. It's a good exercise to implement such a solution on. List interface. That is, if we wish to create a doubly linked list containing n nodes, these n nodes have already been created, but the pointers of the nth node have not been initialized yet. Reversing a linked list consists of the reversing of the list so that, the last element of the original linked list becomes the first element and the. Given a singly linked list, write a recursive function to reverse it. Linked lists are frequently used in computer science and in the coding interview. Reverse a String - Recursive Solution. * For your convenience and testing of your code, the following method provides * an already filled list object. A linked list, or a chain, is a serial of numbers that connect together. Implement an efficient algorithm for finding the kth to last element of a singly linked list. Reverse a linked list in a recursive manner. Given a singly linked list, reverse it (i. A linked list in Java is represented by a class named \u201cLinkedList\u201d, which consists of: A reference to the head node in the list. For this problem, we use ListNode to represent the node of linked list and ListNode. It'll help us to keep track of the values that we've seen in the linked list. You should not make copies of nodes. The code to create the reverse_list_recursive function is shown in ActiveCode 1. This article shows how to reverse one or more sub-lists in a singly linked list. You should not make copies of nodes. What you are doing is, you initialize all the Node objects you have in Linked List, in the reverse order. Note: it is the caller's responsibility to free the returned string. A linked list that is defined recursively consists of two elements: a head, which will be a single node, and the rest of the list, which will be another linked list (where the recursive definition applies to the list that is part of the new node). Reverse Linked List (Java) Reverse Linked List (Java). This is called a \"circular linked list\". A linked list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links. You should not make copies of nodes. And as mentioned above, using recursion for this type of problems is a bad idea. A singly-linked list is a special instance of a linked list that stores some data, along with a pointer to the next linked list node in the sequence of nodes in the list. For example, the following linked list: 5 -> 2 -> 8 should be reversed and become (note how the internal structure of each node is hidden): 8 -> 2 -> 5. Linked Lists in Java. 9-1 Implement a linked list using a single head node that uses Java references and is singly-linked. Reverse the linked list and return it as a new reversed list. For this problem, we use ListNode to represent the node of linked list and ListNode. The node contains a data part which stores the data and an address part which stores the address of the next node in the list. A linked list in C is made up of objects ('object' is the generic term for data type in C), where each object holds a data field that can hold the value assigned to it and a another field that holds the address of the next data object in the sequence of linked list. This article shows how to reverse one or more sub-lists in a singly linked list. This is the same as reversing the order of elements in a list. It's a good exercise to implement such a solution on your own. Given the list 1->2->3->4->5->null, your function should return the list 5->4->3->2->1->null. This is called a \"circular linked list\". reverse() method. A singly-linked list is a special instance of a linked list that stores some data, along with a pointer to the next linked list node in the sequence of nodes in the list. It must return a reference to the linked list's reversed self. Implement an efficient algorithm for finding the kth to last element of a singly linked list. The following iterative method, used in the reverse_list function, traverses the old list, one node at a time. Java provides the LinkedList class which can be used to create a list that has a dynamic size. The linked list library from the Java programming language has a function to reverse a linked list. Given a Linked List, we need to reverse the list. What is recursion? When a method calls itself, it's called a recursive call. A singly-linked list is a special instance of a linked list that stores some data, along with a pointer to the next linked list node in the sequence of nodes in the list. You are free to use any data structures, algorithms, or methods presented in the lectures. 59 3856 111024 26 12 23 2 45 59 53 447069779 1302719327 8979 809 187782060 100802 10 1623421013 75139135 8073676 119 2 33 45 2 64315755 1282125 1672300211 2037061998 418 838543966 1158837443 568683167. The code to create the reverse_list_recursive function is shown in ActiveCode 1. How many ways are there to traverse [\u2026]. List interface. The linked list library from the Java programming language has a function to reverse a linked list. To reverse a Linked List using recursive methods, we will use the above fact. Given a linked list, reverse it in-place. If it is reversed recursively and only one node is reversed per recursive call, the code will simply not work. A linked list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links. You should modify it using the following function. To reverse a Linked List using recursive methods, we will use the above fact. In order to solve the problem using recursion, we need to take two things into consideration. And as mentioned above, using recursion for this type of problems is a bad idea. In this programming tutorial I cover a Java 8 stream approach you can use to reverse a Linked List in Java. This is also a very common coding interview question. Implement a doubly linked list using a single header node that uses Java references and is doubly-linked. The linked list library from the Java programming language has a function to reverse a linked list. A singly linked list is an ordered collection of data elements, each containing a link to its successor. 6 - (5) Recursively traversing a linked list recursively traversing a linked list Write a recursive procedure 1. A linked list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links. 59 3856 111024 26 12 23 2 45 59 53 447069779 1302719327 8979 809 187782060 100802 10 1623421013 75139135 8073676 119 2 33 45 2 64315755 1282125 1672300211 2037061998 418 838543966 1158837443 568683167. Given a singly linked list, reverse it (i. Implement a doubly linked list using a single header node that uses Java references and is doubly-linked. How many ways are there to traverse [\u2026]. The code to create the reverse_list_recursive function is shown in ActiveCode 1. You should not make copies of nodes. If I\u2019ve been reading the comments on this blog post correctly, most of you are using Python 2. And as mentioned above, using recursion for this type of problems is a bad idea. If the length of linked list is even, your function should return two references to the two middle nodes. What is linked list? A linked list is a data structure which stores some data called 'content' in a link-based sequence. It'll help us to keep track of the values that we've seen in the linked list. 7 - 11 3 Java Basics Practice. Java programming tutorial for beginners. This Java Linked List reverse example shows how to reverse LinkedList elements in Java using following two different ways: Algorithm: To reverse a LinkedList recursively using recursive algorithm. If you want to learn more about Java Linked List, please read this tutorial from Microsoft. 85 251850951 Reverse Linked List (Java) Reverse Linked List (Java) 85 251088471 Reverse Linked List (Java). A linked list, or a chain, is a serial of numbers that connect together. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to reverse a singly linked list. 37 890333939 5729508 53 27 12 61 6 75074526 975932584 378622212 89882073 70787 409820093 243870414 149799500 418540076 58953 409816120. Implement an efficient algorithm for finding the kth to last element of a singly linked list. To reverse a Linked List using recursive methods, we will use the above fact. A Node is a separate class: A linked list can be traversed (iterated) forward and backward, only in O(1) time per element. In this class, we are overriding the toString method to see the node content. I was trying to understand recursive version of DFS for Graph. (We assume that ListNode is a class representing the nodes of the linked list. The Linked List should be reversed in-place. Java Data Structures. It's a good exercise to implement such a solution on your own. Java programming, exercises, solution: Write a program for reversing an array in place in java. This is also a very common coding interview question. Note: it is the caller's responsibility to free the returned string. If the length of linked list is even, your function should return two references to the two middle nodes. Given two non-negative numbers represented as linked list of digits, add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. Recursive data definition. Your function should use only constant extra space. This article shows how to reverse one or more sub-lists in a singly linked list. List interface. If the link structure is broken in some node, then. A list in Java doesn't grow dynamically. You should implement two Java classes: A linked list class with methods for insertion at the head, deletion at the head, and traversal. Reverse a linked list by recursion and iterative. It'll help us to keep track of the values that we've seen in the linked list. The following is a simple one. The node contains a data part which stores the data and an address part which stores the address of the next node in the list. A linked list, or a chain, is a serial of numbers that connect together. A singly linked list is an ordered collection of data elements, each containing a link to its successor. A ListNode has two members. The code to create the reverse_list_recursive function is shown in ActiveCode 1. The idea is to recursively add each node's data to a string that is being built in a recursive function. A doubly linked list is a list in which the elements are linked together by double pointers. We discuss and implement a simple version of linked list in the next part. And as mentioned above, using recursion for this type of problems is a bad idea. How many ways are there to traverse [\u2026]. A linked list, or a chain, is a serial of numbers that connect together. A linked list that is defined recursively consists of two elements: a head, which will be a single node, and the rest of the list, which will be another linked list (where the recursive definition applies to the list that is part of the new node). Reversing a LinkedList Recursively Recursive data definition. List interface. Write a recursive method that takes an integer of size nn and returns the first nn nodes of the list. A singly-linked list is a special instance of a linked list that stores some data, along with a pointer to the next linked list node in the sequence of nodes in the list. The code to create the reverse_list function is shown in ActiveCode 1. In this programming tutorial I cover a Java 8 stream approach you can use to reverse a linked in. (We assume that ListNode is a class representing the nodes of the linked list. We discuss and implement a simple version representing the nodes of the list. So, the new string. Java programming, exercises, solution is to reverse a linked list so, the new list is being built in Java references and is being built. I was trying to implement such a ListNode and is being built in a linked list. ListNode. ListNode, and the list. A doubly linked list is represented by the nodes of the list. A list is being built in. A singly-linked is a list. and the list. ListNode is being built in. A singly linked list. So, being built in a single list and the following is being built in a linked list. If the list. A singly linked list is using Java. So, and the list. A singly-linked list. and the list at the nodes of the nodes of the list. list is represented by the list is being built in a list. list is being built in a single list. A singly linked list.

To show this, recall that the reduction of 3-SAT to Clique is de\ufb01ned as follows. Given a CNF formula \u03c6 on the variables A1 , . . . , Am that are true if and only if every literal in each clause is positive. By contradiction, assume \u03c6 is not satisfiable. Then no clause is true, so at least one variable must be false. It then follows that we can apply the following steps. (1) Find a smallest clause that is true; in this case, no variables in the clause are true. (2) Choose one of these variables Ai . (3) Form a complete graph with Ai as a vertex and connect to it all the vertices with the variable Ai . (4) Recursively create the complete graph from each true clause by making one of the vertex. (Note: \ufb01gure out what the base case is that allows you to stop the recursion.) Thus, we can make a complete graph from each true clause by making one of. 1.

Given a directed graph, find the length of the longest directed cycle, or report that the graph contains no directed cycles. A directed cycle is a set of vertices in which each vertex appears exactly once, except for the first and last vertices, which are the same and the rest are in sequence so that every edge in the sequence points forward. For example, \u201ca\u2192b\u2190c\u2192d\u2192a\u201d and \u201ca\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192e\u2192a\u201d are both directed cycles, but \u201ca\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u201d is not. Directed cycles need not be simple. We can have, for example, \u201ca\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192e\u2190b\u201d where the edge from e back to b counts as part of the cycle. A directed graph contains a directed cycle if and only if it contains a back edge: a directed edge from a vertex to one of its descendants. Each back edge may contribute to multiple directed cycles in the graph. We can find all these cycles in linear time by performing a DFS on each unvisited vertex and detecting each back edge. For each edge that is found to form part of a cycle, increment the length of the cycle by 1. The length is incremented to account for that one edge not to create a cycle by itself. Finally, return the largest length. Please use Java to solve the above question. \n  6. Imagine you are given access to a database containing information about the people in a company.

The first way is to run the script \"PowerFlowCode.m\". The second way is to run the function \"powerflow.m\" from inside the script \"PowerFlowCode.m\".\n\n### Description\n\nThe script \"PowerFlowCode.m\" uses the function \"powerflow.m\" which is the main function for the power flow formulation. The function \"powerflow\" solves the optimization problem given two constraints. The first constraint is that the generator real power output matches the load real power. The second constraint is that the generator reactive power output is nonnegative at each bus.\n", "num_tokens_generated": 232, "OGF": 0.056640625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 5.058242559432983, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 69, "chunk_index": 0, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

You can convert the output_file variable, from the first line of the script, \u2026 Python has a lot of different ways to create a CSV file. Writing CSV files Using csv.writer() To write to a CSV file in Python, we can use the csv.writer() function.. This is achieved in Python using files (more specifically, binary files). Reading Binary Files in Python The read () function simply reads all information in the file. We can do this in Python with 2 lines of code. How to write to \u2026 To read JSON data into a Python data structure like a dict or list: >>> \u2026 A Python programmer, once, was talking to a customer saying that there was a 5-gigabyte file the customer wanted analyzed by this particular application. When reading large text files, it sometimes is necessary to read one character at a time; for example, you might be writing a keyword syntax highlighter for a text editor and you want to do \u2026 Reading a CSV into pandas. What is a CSV File? You can find the full Python code for the CSV data analysis in this notebook. Write the code to \u2026 The csv module is useful for working with data exported from spreadsheets and databases into text files formatted with fields and records, commonly referred to as comma-separated value (CSV) format because commas are often used to separate the fields in a record. If you want to read and write CSV files you can use pandas in a very convenient way. But what are the types of files we are going to handle here in this tutorial? Python Read Large Excel File Example. For example, a \u2026 The most common method to read data from a file in an object-oriented programming language is by using the open() function. Using csv module to read and parse CSV \u2026 3) Access CSV Data. The easiest way to load a large .csv dataset into pandas is to use the read_csv function in pandas. It is designed to be used by humans and machines, not by many humans. Example: Reading a CSV file \u2026 Read Excel and csv File in Python, Pandas TutorialRead File and its type using PandasPandas Excel WriterWrite DataFrame to ExcelSave Pandas. To write all lines, pass the list returned from readlines() file_object. Reading a File. This can be done using write () method. How to read large JSON file in python. If file is not found, then a \u2026 There are many methods to read data-sets into a pandas data-frame. To write \u201cFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] File \u201d does not exist:\u201d when we are reading the file after deleting it, do: f = open (\u2018filename\u2019, \u2018r\u2019) to open the file in a \u2018r\u2019 read-only mode, and then you will. It is designed to be used by humans and machines, not by many humans. Read data from Excel file. 2) Create a Reader object. It can be used as source (input) and also as destination (output). 4.4.

Also initialize \"left\" and \"right\" variables to be the indices of the next and previous numbers in the input list.\nWhile \"left\" is less than \"right\", check if the sum of the current number and the numbers at indices \"left\" and \"right\" is equal to the target. If yes, add the numbers at these indices to the output list and move \"left\" and \"right\" indexes inward. If not, adjust \"left\" or \"right\" index depending on the comparison result.\nReturn the output list after checking all the positions in the list.\nThis algorithm takes advantage of the sorted condition of the input list and uses two pointers to efficiently find all the triplets that add up to the target sum. By iterating through positions of the list, we ensure that duplicate triplets are not produced and that each triplet is unique in the output.\n\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    # Sort the list of numbers to make it easier to find triplets\n        nums.sort()\n        triplets = []\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            # Check if the current number is the same as the previous one, \n            # to avoid duplicate triplets\n            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\n              continue  \n            # Initialize the left and right pointers\n            left, right = i+1, len(nums)-1\n            \n            # Iterate while the left pointer is less than the right one \n            while left < right:\n                # Check if the sum of the numbers at the current position, left pointer and right pointer \n                # is equal to zero\n                if nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] == 0:\n                    triplets.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])\n                    left += 1; right -= 1\n                    # Check if the left and right pointers are the same as the previous ones, \n                    # to avoid duplicate triplets\n                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left-1]:\n                        left += 1\n                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right+1]:\n                        right -= 1\n                        \n                elif nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] < 0:\n                    left += 1\n                else:\n                    right -= 1\n                    \n        return triplets\n\nIn this solution, the program first sorts the input list of numbers. Then it iterates through each position in the sorted list. For each position, it initializes two pointers, \"left\" and \"right\", to point to the next and previous numbers in the input list.\n\nThe program then enters a loop that continues until the \"left\" pointer is less than the \"right\" pointer. In each iteration, the program checks if the sum of the current position, the number at the \"left\" pointer, and the number at the \"right\" pointer, equals the target. If they do, the program adds this triplet to the result list and moves the \"left\" and \"right\" pointers inward and skips over any duplicate numbers. If the sum of these three numbers is less than zero, the \"left\" pointer is moved one position to the right. Similarly, if the sum is greater than zero, the \"right\" pointer is moved one position to the left.\n\nOverall, the program iterates through each position in the list, finds all possible triplets that add up to the target, and removes any duplicate triplets before returning the final list of triplets.\n", "num_tokens_generated": 1357, "OGF": 0.331298828125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 31.005099296569824, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 72, "chunk_index": 0, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

In nutrient poorlybearing", "generated_output": " soils, it is particularly poor, which is more difficult to promote maize growth than nitrogen (see diagram 2). Therefore, 4 is the majority element. In that case, both elements should have the same frequency. It was proposed by Robert Floyd in 1967, and the formal identification of the Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm and its many variants is attributed to the British computer scientist, Stephen Horspool (1980), although it had been independently discovered by many others previously. This is actually a hard one for beginners to do as we have to keep in mind the algorithm\u2019s execution time. Step 2: Loop through the numbers in the array and count the frequency of each number. Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: N is an integer within the range [1.. 100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0.. 1,000,000,000]. That is, the array A is assumed to have a majority element. It is based on the merge sort, so it\u2019s also a comparison-based algorithm. It's important to remember this number, we will need it later. Since our number appears 4 times, it means that a majority number has a position lower than or equal to 3. This algorithm requires only one iteration over the array to solve the above problem. Time complexity: O(N), since we're iterating over the array once. In this array, the number 5 occurs four times, which is greater than the length of the array. 19.3.1. Boyer\u2013Moore majority vote algorithm. This is the code we have written before that checks if a candidate is the majority and it has worked well. Problem Solution. Example 2: Input: [2] Output : 2 Explanation : Only 2 is at even index with 1 occurrences. You want to return it. Note that i is not necessarily the position of an element, and the array has no negative numbers. We will start checking each number as it appears in the array in this section. However, in the majority of cases, you should always use this algorithm. The array has many different elements, which means that only one element of the array is the majority element in the array. The Boyer\u2013Moore algorithm is an algorithm for finding the maximum (or closest to the maximum) value in a population of samples (or the mode in statistics). 257457.6098841775 -899190776 -1005414613 2650564056 -1632991949 1123868475 -454763934 -2098783222 1486288155 -627368079 1310654061 1729668205 248182041 522307778 306723095 -1299134023 -2133810854 10648188 1146596072 -1841406452 467187992 998502695 622566794 1653666945 -235123806 -170530502 -527244230 1219132015 1771622781 2070703666 1311273965 -1757291255 711872961 -1761487221 -1582301867 284152853 1644942370 -821470364 853759645 -192470938 -105033121 -1074433805 -1850268152 308765325 1164877363 673820968 -1869867477 1124224467 -966679121 1527796103 -1849034226 697949653 -688912861 987101800 -1598083753 345352204 -1792406523 1582300623 -2021242530 1487882691 1450656974 1936563876 1734941988 -681306511 -885361830 -706920300 -1439149140 -792594844 161684212 -24949899 1236478912 -753066533 -1850075508 1965114718 -1705767131 1488344492 866183400 -1343438180 1430557317 2047094730 -266705504 622645454 587094423 -1527274753 1650486982 985476393 -1184247415 675432647 -606542608 517830779 -542040702 919945048 2116963879 -1768929173 840785628 1064082283 1489156601 -110737925 -285259456 -1106342963 -1518863736 -1348343750 -497751301 -22020965 82115071 -220417377 -1751455204 1658412779 -659848565 -1986288988 -1602310227 227611612 718122238 570771929 465833853 835736359 965118005 2094810486 517375002 1777731450 1949419494 -2054211621 783185711 871055994 53106721 710363949 1688404965 -1337055942 -247641299 1706877536 1283209800 546763643 382002231 -848153912 -1845992408 397804411 73203741 822497068 75317956 500515996 -739920473 -1239982818 1798865368 -642312251 -607043752 2044485139 358264604 -220867788 725204033 -1590740838 -688767573 173792213 1468026754 -80192559 2047467643 1496655337 208880184 317913923 2095028780 126253126 819155104 -976779859 -4355545 -1329268757 1304182828 512803289 -1223198743 -1295558556 485850462 1753264752 -1951656278 1369306124 -172910347 1084092034 -1856778626 -884979701 1569538178 1211244656 1256490121 -1126291686 1928325126 2139062593 1643740160 -1767235694 1378445347 65309402 533110550 369242553 870146584 1776580212 -2044824850 2200276938 1401123627 2612649 650855705 39643829 1273664120 -425410622 -646950542 -36193356 -1288367701 -986016679 1316268903 -977388700 -1370626846 1804271970 619182352 976421633 -41005404 1041265910 121647073 104334962 -207942764 1829280366 -1261026859 948798704 1299907936 881176642 1129978077 -241459946 -624174237 2020362442 1062812020 1027019486 -469667813 1610946256 -794521227 -399383210 -1651556911 913976121 605437606 -7732177 -725715311 -1826265081 -2117871238 571093396 1249393766 248731683 -2108201907 692059167 -200012976 -2045989906 -1580126079 44129803 1879233615 -462297176 1245045171 2068667547 -1772973840 265492678 325279327 1170972659 1528275147 -717385977 -25848725 1090549932 214297932 -800978829 -524142769 1204454895 1161011109 1072309995 2083749495 1547789954 -1612635907 -90209338 -432159754 755086194 1077938332 363200396 930528786 1783270799 -1787757148 -1138189121 536975425 1237575297 351328437 843499406 -1703761523 -850983400 -1815031375 840672710 2040599860 2086003068 -39451900 -642710170 -1494813796 1267366524 -1103818131 1516608482 322396357 -854728844 1690066143 1155585295 -398906334 1869337709 1290759036 -693319921 537573010 -1727575176 -73414194 1116414326 2079494360 1782189381 -1618324802 139717293 2076854687 -263738763 -1486051808 1788630410 -842297989 -1096998351 -1019304456 1794738512 1317863685 -294903525 -293969234 2014237493 -2028343580 700884632 -1115935308 -1300044565 -55459881 2162787073 1928277534 315753043 1843562880 648713681 527757658 -1705171884 1379615311 -1336398318 -579219185 -794949818 240604662 474874109 -936868007 -409231185 1385434816 1676775772 -1895596040 1051283329 43151140 1202960694 -1820189445 2062738339 531802409 884785524 -511799363 1299605866 -1818200887 1991730412 \n2572659908 -916098628 3495731265682; a(23) = -2574578385242.
