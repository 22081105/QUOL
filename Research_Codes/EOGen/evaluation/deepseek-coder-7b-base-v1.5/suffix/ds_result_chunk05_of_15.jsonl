Explain how the sport is different in New Zealand. 1. A rugby fan of the Maori is someone who enjoys the sport because of their heritage or cultural background. 2. In New Zealand, rugby is a very popular sport among the Maori people. This is because the sport is passed down through generations, and many of the Maori people are now professionals in the sport. 3. Maori rugby teams are often very successful and have won many cups and trophies over the years. 4. The Maori rugby team is known for its physicality and toughness, which makes it a tough opponent for any other team. 5.

In nutrientOPT gale", "generated_output": ", the judiciary plays a crucial role in a democratic society by ensuring fairness, justice, and due process. The judiciary maintains and enforces the principles of the rule of law, protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals and promoting a fair and equitable society. The role of the judiciary is to provide a framework for resolving disputes through a fair and impartial adjudication process. The judiciary plays a key role in upholding the constitution and interpreting laws, and they are responsible for ensuring that all individuals are treated equally and have the same rights and protections. They also play a critical role in enforcing the judiciary's rules of evidence, including the presumption of innocence, and the legal rights of both the accuser and the defendant. The judiciary also plays a critical role in protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals and the rule of law, and their actions can greatly impact society. \n\n{{< ask_chatgpt >}}\nList the steps or process the judiciary may take to conduct a judicial review against the Supreme Court of an alleged ruling of the supreme court. Give the example and explain how each step is involved.\n{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}\n\n\n\n1. The first step in conducting a judicial review against the Supreme Court of an alleged decision is raising a petition for review. This can be done through the Supreme Court of Canada, through a lawyer, or through a private individual. \n\n2. Once the petition is filed, the court will review the allegations and determine if there is sufficient legal reasoning to justify a review. \n\n3. If approved, the case will be transferred to a specific division of the Supreme Court, which will then assign a judge to hear the case. \n\n4. The next step is to prepare for the case through discovery, such as preparing for questions and evidence. The judge will also hear oral arguments from the parties. \n\n5. Once the arguments are complete, the judge will then issue his or her decision, either affirming or reversing the Supreme Court ruling. \n\n6. The review of the Supreme Court decision could result in the party filing a motion to appeal to the Court of Appeal or a motion to dismiss.\n\nFor example, suppose the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s ruling has been appealed to the Supreme Court under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms section 5. In this case, the appellant would have to file a petition for a judicial review based on their belief that the Supreme Court has made an error of law in its decision. Upon approval of the petition, a judge from the Supreme Court would hear the argument from both sides. The judge would then make a decision on whether to affirm or reverse the decision of the Supreme Court. \n\n{{< ask_chatgpt >}}\nList the steps or process the judiciary may take to conduct a judicial review against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of an alleged ruling of the Supreme Court made by Chief Justice of Canada. Give the example and explain how each step is involved.\n{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}\n\n\n\n1. After the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada makes a ruling, an aggrieved party can raise a \"Review Application\" with the Supreme Court.\n\n2. The Review Application must be filed within a specified timeframe after the ruling and must follow specific procedural rules.\n\n3. Once filed, the Supreme Court will conduct a review of the ruling and assess whether the Chief Justice followed the proper legal principles and procedures.\n\n4. If the Supreme Court deems that the Chief Justice has violated the proper legal norms, it may rule in favour of the aggrieved party or uphold the Chief Justice's ruling.\n\n5. In such cases, the Supreme Court may determine whether the Chief Justice should be removed from office or if the case should be referred to another body for review.\n\n\nAn example of this process occurred in a case involving the judicial review of a controversial decision by the Chief Justice of Canada, who ruled that the Quebec provincial government had the right to introduce certain policies for francophone education in the province.\n\nAfter the Chief Justice's ruling, an aggrieved party, the Quebec government, raised a Review Application with the Supreme Court of Canada. After carefully reviewing the Court's ruling, the Supreme Court agreed with the Quebec government that the Chief Justice had violated the proper legal norms in his decision. As a result, the Supreme Court ruled that the Quebec government was entitled to bring a lawsuit against the Chief Justice for violations of his constitutionally protected rights. This case illustrates how the Supreme Court of Canada may conduct judicial review against the Chief Justice of Canada, as he is a constitutional officer with important powers and responsibilities.\n\n", "num_tokens_generated": 972, "OGF": 0.2373046875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 21.66807794570923, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 205, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Explain how the use of extraterritoriality or universal jurisdiction violates the rule of non-res judicata. Are extraterritorialities and universal jurisdiction always constitutional? How could they evolve in the future? The law is the key element that guarantees human rights to individuals and states, as well as the mechanisms through which this is achieved. In addition to being part of the constitution, the criminal law regulates the relationship between citizens and the State, with respect to the activities that carry a possible penalty. Criminal law also regulates the relationship between citizens, as well as the relationship between the State and its subjects.\nIt is the type of law that governs the relationship between the state and the communities, including those that are related to security, such as immigration or customs. It is the type of law that establishes the norms that govern public action in the relationship between citizens, communities and States. In a broader sense, public law is concerned with the management of a state's actions in the management of its various internal and public interests.\nCriminal Law\nCriminal law is the branch of law that deals with criminal offenses, their definition, consequences and legal remedies. It focuses on criminal acts, including crimes, acts of violence, and violations of public morality, among others, and can be both civil or procedural law related to criminal practices. Procedural law is the legal branch that makes it possible to know and establish the means of resolving a dispute without determining in it, which may have an effect on the victim's rights and may involve the public interest or may affect the common good. The procedural law that applies to criminal acts must establish the actions and means that can be applied to resolve the respective actions that are being contemplated and the public interest, the same type of proceedings that are used in criminal law; in other words, it is a law that is concerned with the application of justice in the resolution of different disputes and crimes that involve the State, communities and even the private sector, so that the rights of each person can be protected, the public good can be preserved, and the interests that the person has over another person or entity is determined and protected in the way that he / she wishes. In addition, the Procedural Law deals with criminal offenses that are committed in such a way that the public interest is violated, so that the respective person is punished in accordance with the criminal law. It must be taken into account that although he may not be a criminal law, the procedural law may also be applied in some of his actions and practices, which may involve that the person who is involved or has something in common with the person who has committed the crime is penalized in the way that he demands; this does not have to be the case that the criminal law has to apply. The Procedural Law must be applied to any type of legal action that concerns the State, its people or the private sector or communities, and in these actions must be determined whether it is a private action or a criminal action, and must be applied the respective procedural law. Procedural law can be applied in a civil action, a collective action, and in an administrative action. A civil dispute or dispute is a conflict that involves private persons or private actions, and in this type of action, the procedures to resolve this type of action are called Procedural Law. Collective disputes or actions involve one or more communities or groups. With respect to administrative disputes or actions, the procedures that govern these actions must also be considered the Procedural Law and the Disciplinary Law in the State.\nIn this case, the criminal law determines who is a criminal, and in what ways must be condemned; therefore, it is a branch more focused on the person and his or her actions, with a specific purpose that criminalizes the offense to guarantee the rights of the law and to preserve the well-being and the rights of all or some of the people. So, the criminal law is a branch of legal science. It is a field that has its origin in antiquity and developed over time. It was characterized by the need to maintain control over the society, in order to prevent its internal and external chaos and disorderliness.\nWith this control, it was achieved, the respect for the public law, the stability of the state, the security of members of the community, and the protection of the national assets, among others, and this was also necessary to protect the private, which became the central element in the development of legal science. In its development, criminal law was one of the first legal branches that were created, and has had the support of a lot of countries of the world. The law regulates the relationships between the citizen and the State to ensure the defense of their rights; it deals with actions that can be committed against other parties, as well as with the possible punishment that has to be applied to these actions. Criminal law acts in the social order, the State controls the behaviors of every citizen; in its functioning it is always based on a certain set of ethical standards that aim to maintain the equilibrium between the citizen, the legal system and the State.\nThe use of justice in maintaining the equilibrium is fundamental in the functioning of the criminal law, since justice is an important constituent of justice and the equilibrium is essential to maintain the balance and the order in the society. What type of crime is the crime? What are the main legal criteria for the definition of criminal offenses? In this context, which of the following crimes would be illegal according to a criminal law that includes the definition of human trafficking? Which type of crime is the crime? What are the main legal criteria to establish criminal offenses? Which legal criterion justifies that people who sexually abuse children will be considered criminals? In a constitutional constitution, how can legislators ensure that the State will be able to defend these rights? Which form of crime is the crime? What are the main legal criteria for the definition of criminal offenses? In what cases does the State not have criminal jurisdiction? What is the difference between procedural law and criminal law? How does criminal law, on the one hand, differ from civil law and, on the other hand, procedural law? What is the role of the state in promoting constitutionalism? Which of the following crimes would be illegal according to a criminal law that includes the definition of trafficking of human beings?\nIs what it contains.\nWhat is the general law? In what type of action does the law of nature play the same role in it? How is it possible that a certain group of civil rights is not protected by the legal system and still be recognized and accepted by the community? Compare the concept of constitutionalism applied in a procedural law with the constitutionalism applied in criminal law. Describe the three phases of a lawsuit. Does civil law have extraterritoriality and universal jurisdiction? Why is the right against double jeopardy in criminal law an important right? Examine which of the following cases is a crime, which is a criminal procedure and which is a civil procedure. Explain the application of the penal law in the world of the Internet: why is it important for civil and criminal law to regulate the activities of social networks? What is double jeopardy and which of the following crimes would be illegal according to a criminal law that includes the definitions of illegal possession of weapons and child pornography?\nCriminal law is the branch of law that regulates the relationship between citizens, community and State in the event that any of the mentioned parties acts in a way that violates public order and public morality. The criminal law does this by defining a criminal offense as a practice that may harm another person or the public interest and that involves the risk of violating human rights, with the purpose of guaranteeing the defense of these rights.\nIn a democratic situation, the constitutional constitution allows the Government to declare a criminal offense and apply the corresponding rules to these actions, which are carried out when the same is considered as a crime. It is considered as a crime if they do not respect a certain set of rules and responsibilities when performing certain actions or participating in certain activities. Criminal jurisprudence establishes the law that defines criminal offenses and their corresponding consequences.\nOne of the main sources of criminal jurisprudence are the principles of constitutional law. The principles of constitutional law guarantee legal order among people and promote the maintenance of order in their relations with the State, such as providing for the protection of human rights, such as the right against violence and the right to liberty. Therefore, these principles help to maintain the equilibrium between the citizen and the State.\nCriminal law is, therefore, the branch of the criminal law that regulates the relationship between its subjects and the State regarding their actions in those areas. It determines the nature of offenses and the severity of penalties that these may entail, so that the respective person is penalized in a way that complies with the applicable standard of justice. The criminal law is considered as a crime if it violates public order and public morality and does not respect a certain set of rules and responsibilities when participating in certain activities.\nThe criminal law, criminal jurisprudence and its principles of constitutional law determine the severity of the penalty that must be applied to the criminal. The severity of crime is defined and regulated by the criminal punishment and the punishment. The severity of crime must comply with the principles of constitutional law. Criminal law must follow principles that comply with the standard of criminal jurisprudence, such as legal order and the preservation of equality among citizens. The principles of criminal jurisprudence determine the severity of the crime and the corresponding punishment in the face of a crime that causes a certain social damage or harm.\nThe criminal law and criminal jurisprudence are responsible for regulating criminal offenses and the penalties that apply to them. The severity of the crime and the corresponding punishment are defined by the legal criteria established by these two sources.\nOn the other hand, the civil law is the branch of law that regulates the relationship between citizens, communities and States, and which is focused on the protection of the constitutional rights of the individuals mentioned. As it can be observed, each has their own role in relation to the defense of constitutional rights, and this is something of significance.\nCriminal law is the branch of law that regulates the relationship between citizens, communities and State, and which is focused on the protection of constitutional rights of the mentioned individuals.", "num_tokens_generated": 2282, "OGF": 0.55712890625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 52.87941265106201, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 208, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

She believes that it has significant, unique features that would be valuable to buyers.  \nHow much should I offer for this home and why?  \nThis is actually really difficult to answer. In the case of a seller of a unique property, the fact that they are unique may mean that they do not have to list at full market value, and can accept a lower offer in order to get the home sold. This may be true if they believe they have enough time to find a willing buyer. Otherwise, if not, then they will need to list at full market value and have a willing seller to buy it.  \nI'm going to do a different, yet simple problem. I am interested in selling this home, knowing that I won't get much for this house. Now I have put only a modest down payment on this house, which I can repay.  \nThe problem I have: I've put 10 down on this house and I know my mortgage is $300,000. I don't have the $300k. What can I do?  \nCan I use the equity and sell it, using the proceeds from the money I sell to pay for the rest of the loan. I can borrow money at about 8% interest. I don't want to have debt on top of debt if I can help it. I would like to know what can be done.  \nAnd how do I figure out what I can sell?  \n\n###  How might I get better at using \"What, How, When, Where, Who, Why\" in marketing?\nHow might I get better at using **\"What, How, When, Where, Who, Why\"** in marketing?\n**My question:** \"Why is your class so good?\"\n**My response:** It allows for you to use all the time for practice.

These are the reasons why marketing is effective. We want as many consumers as possible to consider our brand.\n**2\\. The Marketing Mix to Produce Choice**\nWe want some consumers to switch from competitor brands. The two major objectives of the market mix strategy is to generate awareness and generate interest. The objective is to generate interest rather than just consider (that is why many marketers use the term \"consideration\").

We hypothesized that the determinants of optimal and plant-based diets would be broadly similar, with the exception of energy requirements for different lifestyles.\nConclusion: Overall, we identified 9 potentially clinically relevant determinants of diet-related nutrient concentration across five dietary patterns.\nTrial registration: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02290615).\nThe evidence-based medicine (EBM) movement [1, 2] has aimed to increase the clinical usefulness and effectiveness of healthcare and improve clinical practice with a focus on the identification and clinical application of high-quality evidence. EBM is now considered part of the evidence-informed practice (EIP) movement [3], to which EBM is but one pillar [4]. In short, EBM aims to increase the usefulness, practicality, and validity of healthcare by using scientific methodology to synthesize and analyse high-quality clinical evidence [1].\nAccording to the US Preventive Services Task Force [5], the primary goal of an evidence-based approach is to identify high-quality evidence to inform decisions about patient care that reflect best available clinical practice [2]. We define EMB as a set of principles that promote the use of high-quality clinical evidence in healthcare at the clinical decision-making process [6], and therefore can support the development of effective healthcare interventions [5]. EMB has become a widely promoted concept in the NHS literature as a means to guide evidence-based practice in healthcare [7].\nIn this paper, we discuss why EMB is important, how it can be applied in clinical practice and we illustrate a case of a clinical question where EMB is useful in a practical context. We review the main EMB principles [8], steps in EBM [9], and key features of evidence [5]. We then review evidence-based medicine principles, summarising relevant features in three main steps in applying EMB for clinical decision-making [6]. We then consider the application of these principles and methods in a clinical practice context, and discuss the importance of appropriate methodological use in the search for evidence. We also consider the use of existing online tools for finding relevant research, including several important examples of relevant online resources, including the WHO\u2019s Expert Interviews on Dietary Guidelines [8] and the US-based search tool Evidence Explorer [6]. We also provide practical examples from the literature on a clinical question where evidence from a systematic review may be used to provide guidance in the development of practical healthcare advice, to promote a practical approach to EMB.\nWhat is EBM?\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) is an approach to healthcare that guides decision making based on high-quality evidence [2]. It recognises that clinical practice is informed by imperfect, often incomplete, and sometimes even erroneous evidence [5].\nAlthough clinicians have known for a long time that high-quality clinical evidence improves the effectiveness of healthcare [3], it is only over the last decade that there has been a push to promote this approach with tools to support clinicians to do so. This is now referred to as evidence-informed practice (EIP).\nWhy is EBM important for clinical practice?\nIncreasingly, researchers are becoming aware that the quality of evidence from a systematic review is important and needs to be systematically evaluated [10]. One important example is the publication of the Cochrane Handbook 5.5.1 [10] and the release of the tool Evidence@Ed which is used to systematically evaluate evidence in systematic reviews of healthcare interventions, enabling users to identify quality improvements and opportunities for further research for each review [10].\nEvidence-based medicine has been developed to improve research transparency and, in turn, promote high-quality clinical evidence [11, 12]. EMB also improves clinical research outcomes, increases healthcare services, and improves clinical decision-making [3, 13].\nEvidence-based medicine principles\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force 2018 [5] provide a clear statement defining evidence-based medicine as being \u201ca process for systematically finding and evaluating relevant evidence [for healthcare]\u201d. We recommend this task force 2018 statement to provide a useful definition of evidence-based medicine and, therefore, as the relevant definition for EBM.\nThey provide a list of important aspects of this definition. We list several of these in Figure 1.\nSeveral EMB methods have been developed to apply these principles for clinical decision-making, including the evidence-based assessment (EBA) method [14] and the Evidence Analysis Summary (EAS) method developed by the Cochrane Collaboration [15]. The key methodological steps in EBM involve identifying the clinical question, defining a systematic review, identifying participants/assessors, data collection, data analysis, identifying the population/sample size, and reporting to policy forums [16].\nEvidence-based medicine guidelines for clinical practice\nIt is clear that EMB has moved from being a methodology and an approach to being a guide to decision making to provide evidence-based advice to clinicians. This process of translating research outputs to provide practical advice has been achieved by several initiatives that provide practical, evidence-based advice in the field of clinical nutrition and obesity. In line with the Cochrane Collaboration and the US Preventive Services Task Force, we summarise evidence-based advice and guidelines for clinical practice as follows.\nKey features of evidence-based food guidance\nThe aim of the EBM, is to use existing high-quality health evidence to give policy makers, developers of clinical guidelines and evidence-based clinical practices, and healthcare professionals with clinical practice recommendations to support clinical decision-making [13].\nFirst, the EBM should provide recommendations to support clinical decision-making for patients. There is a need for the evidence-based recommendations to be simple, practical, and easy to use, ideally without requiring detailed or specific details of implementation [5, 17].\nSecond, the EBM must clearly define who the target population is. For example, if evidence indicates a different approach in young and old people, the target population needs to be defined for EBM to be applied.\nThird, the EBM aims to provide recommendations at a specific point in time, so that they cover an important time frame [18]. For example, if guidelines are intended to be updated regularly, they should reflect this for the time frame of the guideline and recommendations should not be too time dependent [17]. It is more practical and useful if clinical guidelines support the clinical situation and have a limited lifespan [13].\nFourth, it is important that guidelines and recommendations reflect the evidence available and are not too restrictive [5, 7]. For example, if the evidence is insufficient, then recommendations could include a range of options rather than just one single recommendation.\nFinally, the EMB guideline must be easy to understand and support implementation, and be simple to communicate to healthcare decision makers [8]. This is particularly relevant for clinical practice contexts because there typically is only a limited amount of time available to clinicians for the clinical decision-making process. This may be due to patient pressures or because of the limited time that clinicians have available for a clinical decision-making process [19].\nIn summary, there are many important features related to EBM that should be considered when adapting existing clinical research to provide clinical decisions and recommendations for use in clinical practice.\nApplying evidence-based medicine principles for clinical practice\nIt is clear that the EMB approach is very important and relevant for clinical application as it improves the effectiveness of healthcare and enhances patient care [5]. However, it is also clear that implementation and uptake of EMB principles in practice is not straightforward. One simple starting point for the adaptation of research to clinical practice is to apply the EMB principles to a clinical question in order to help in this process [11, 16].\nWe have published several examples of EMB guidelines, which we review in the remainder of the paper. We also consider the application of EMB principles to an illustrative case from the literature in line with the US Preventive Services Task Force [5, 6], using the EBM principles as an example.\nIn the case study, we consider a nutritional question around energy for energy conservation [20] in two main groups:\nPeople who are low in energy and are weight stable\nPeople who are weight stable and who wish to increase their energy.\nThe EIP principles apply first to assess whether the clinical question has been addressed by other literature. From this, we develop a clinical question with reference to the above-mentioned groups. We can then start to consider the following principles. A summary of the EBM principles and our example is provided in Table 1.\nStep 1: clinical decisions should be based on high-quality evidence\nWe start considering evidence from relevant published health research for the clinical decision of energy. Ideally, we want to use the most recent publication. There is an emerging online tool, the Evidence Explorer, that enables clinical questions to prompt a search and provides key links to the latest research to inform decision making for a clinical question [6]. For the case question about energy for energy conservation [20], the Evidence Explorer (see Additional file 1) is able to retrieve relevant published studies and highlight relevant areas for further assessment (e.g., relevant key studies, available guidance, and data).\nAccording to the Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence to support a clinical decision should be at least of Good Quality. This refers to the quality of the research methodology used to derive the conclusions that form the basis of a clinical decision. They describe five main criteria that should be considered when assessing the quality to produce evidence (2009) [21] that is relevant to EBM principles, which we summarise in Additional file 1.\nWe consider two publications relevant to our case, one by [22] that investigated the effects of a plant-based diet for long-term energy conservation and weight loss and a second by [23] that investigated energy intake for long-term energy conservation. We then follow the Cochrane process of critically assessing the evidence. We use the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s Decision Rules to assess the evidence for each of the two key questions [25].\nStep 2: key information for clinical decision-making should be accessible and easily retrievable\nWe need to be able to retrieve information about the relevant studies so that it is available for consideration. We consider the Evidence Explorer tool that is part of the US Web-based EIP Community Hub and the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) Expert Interview Series (EIS) [8].\nThe Evidence Explorer is an open-access, searchable, and crowdsourced resource that provides a transparent and accessible method for searching clinical research across multiple databases [10]. The tool has the advantage that it automatically searches for relevant research in several key databases. It produces summaries of primary studies and is able to identify relevant secondary and other evidence sources, key questions, key trials, methodological quality of evidence, and the search results to date.\nFor the case question, the Evidence Explorer [10] automatically searches eight databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, PsychInfo, PsychPapers, The Open Citation Index, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed (see Additional file 1: Figure S1, and in Additional file 2). It also offers the functionality of saving publications and managing them as references which may be linked to future publications and as a central point to access relevant publications [6].\nThe WHO\u2019s Expert Interviews and online search tools EIS are a good source of information of interest to those using evidence within the Cochrane Collaboration to inform clinical guideline and practice development [8]. As the EIP Community Hub and the EIS, in particular, are constantly updated and reflect the most recent evidence available, we consider them as tools that support high-quality decision-making about clinical question in a simple, practical way.\nFor the case question, we use the WHO\u2019s Expert Interviews on Dietary Guidelines [8] which provide a key overview of the EMB evidence and guidance relevant to health nutrition. The Expert Interviews are considered by the nutrition working groups to be suitable for the population, and are considered by the Committee of Experts under the supervision of the WHO Regional Office for Europe (ROE) in Budapest. They are considered as evidence for making recommendations on public health policy regarding nutrition [26, 27].\nThe most recent Expert Interviews are available on the WHO\u2019s website (see Additional file 1, in Additional file 2, and in Additional file 3). We also list the three most recent EIS in the EIP Community Hub under the section \u2018Additional resources\u2019.\nStep 3: clinical decision-making can be implemented\nIn this particular case, we only use the evidence that is relevant to inform our decision, but we must not forget that there is often a need to consider other factors. We want to identify relevant research from different fields to inform clinical decision making for the energy question and the related clinical question.\nFurther details on how to search a variety of online resources related to this clinical question are provided in Additional file 1.\nWe provide the following list of online search tools:\n- 1.\nThe Evidence Explorer [25, 6]\n- 2.\nPubMed Central [28] provides free full-text access to preprints under Creative Commons licensing to authors.\n- 3.\nWeb of Science [29] provides free access to full-text content at journals. It provides access to over 2 million citations for full article PDFs that are held by its subscribing partner journals.\n- 4.\nGoogle Scholar [27] is a comprehensive index of research articles, conference papers, and other types of intellectual works and provides free access to content.\nWe also provide the following databases for specific fields that might be useful for the clinical decision:\n- 1.\nObesity Science & Technology;\n- 2.\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition;\n- 3.\nThe Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\nStep 4: evidence-based decisions can be replicated\nWhen a clinician is challenged with a decision to be made, he or she needs to consider the importance, impact, and value of the evidence and then consider the cost to implement the decision. Decision-makers should be willing to engage in a process that enables them to consider the full evidence available [30].\nIt is important that there are resources available to systematically identify and access research evidence in order to support clinical decision-making for a patient and clinical team. The Evidence Explorer makes this much easier by providing tools to search and review published evidence related to an identified clinical question.\nStep 5: research evidence can be adapted to different clinical contexts and clinical practices\nThe aim of evidence-based medicine guidelines is to provide a practical method for using EMB principles to support clinical decision making [5]. The aim of developing this case is to demonstrate how a research question can be applied to a practical situation and can make a contribution to support decision making in clinical practice in a hospital environment.\nStep 6: guidelines can be used as a standard of good practice for healthcare decision making\nWe have described the key features of evidence-based medicine guidelines. We reviewed the EBM principles and demonstrated how they can be used to guide decision making [17, 31].\nThe guideline process is a collaborative effort using several sources, including primary data and secondary data from relevant clinical and research studies. It often involves clinicians and researchers collaborating to develop and evaluate the methods of their preferred choice and subsequently develop an evidence-based guideline [32, 33]. The guideline process is generally iterative and can use several key stages that we describe in Additional file 1: Additional File 2. Once developed, guideline recommendations may be published for wider use [32].\nThese guidelines, in the case of this paper, provide a specific guide for clinicians on how to identify, understand, and use high-quality research that may have relevance to their practice. The first aim is to help to guide clinical decisions and practice, especially when there are several possible options, or when a clinician needs to provide advice to another clinician when deciding on a specific option.\nThe second aim of the guideline is to identify evidence that may be useful for a specific clinical or health practice question, which the guideline can use to support clinical decision making and practice. These guidelines may also use relevant research evidence as part of their development, implementation and evaluation. The key output should be a clear, evidence-based clinical guideline or protocol that can be implemented safely and effectively [5, 31]. The guideline principles should include guidance about how to use and evaluate the research evidence to support their decision making and should be accessible to healthcare decision makers to support decision making.\nThe clinical guidelines are intended to be used by a clinical team to support the process of clinical decision making [18, 34]. There are several key considerations that need to be addressed as part of clinical guidelines, including several key decisions about the guideline itself, the process of guideline development and, more generally, the process of clinical practice and guideline development. Clinical guidelines should be user-friendly and support the patient and patient\u2019s decision-making processes. As suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration, the use of evidence should be described when possible, in a simple way that is easy to understand [24].\nResearch and clinical evidence and guidelines should be used for several purposes. We focus on the first purpose here, which is to provide relevant and effective guidance to help clinicians to make practical clinical decisions.\nThe second aim of clinical guidelines is that they should be able to increase clinical research outcomes, reduce the time between research being published and clinical practice and improve health outcomes for patients and the population [35].\nThe EMB principles aim to increase research outcomes in several important ways. For example, the use of relevant primary research may help to inform current clinical practice and potentially influence patient choice and decision making for clinical interventions and practices. There is also need to have a method to access and share research in a practical and informative way.\nUsing relevant evidence to inform clinical decisions and clinical practice is important because, particularly for obesity, clinical practice may be complicated by multiple clinical issues that affect patient care. There are several important considerations that clinicians need to integrate in their patients\u2019 decision making, including lifestyle/diet and lifestyle/diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, co-morbidities, and secondary interventions such as pharmacological or psychosocial interventions [33]. Using the principles of EMB, together with other aspects of clinical decision making, can be useful to help patients make informed decisions.\nIn our example, we look at two possible dietary patterns for patients with weight instability (we use the following terminology to describe the nutritional status of the target population: (1) weight stable people, (2) underweight people, (3) weight stable people with normal weight, (4) overweight people, (5) obese people). For each of these groups, we consider energy supply. We discuss potential ways to ensure a sustainable long-term energy supply in each group. Then we summarise how important it may be to consider various factors, such as food and nutrition, and how this should be implemented as part of clinical practice for energy. There is a need for the evidence for energy in clinical nutrition practice to use the EMB principles to support clinical decision making for energy in practice.\nWe focus on the three key recommendations for long-term energy supply: a balanced diet, a high dietary protein density diet, and a plant-based diet. The first recommendation is that there are several potential food compositions that may provide the energy to support long-term and sustainable energy. There are important considerations about the food composition and macronutrient profile of a diet, with several different dietary strategies in clinical practice. Plant-based diets are well known in this respect and have several important features to maintain the health of diet [34]. In our example from the EMB, we consider the potential plant-based dietary patterns that provide enough energy to meet an individual\u2019s needs. We provide an overview of these dietary patterns based on the Dietary Patterns in the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [36]. We discuss the recommended dietary patterns, and key considerations for clinical decision making include energy needs and the use of healthy food. We look how relevant evidence can be used to identify other factors that may be crucial for energy with plant-based food and how one may be able to identify relevant primary and secondary (secondary) research about energy to be able to identify how to identify the most important factors about energy conservation with plant-based food [20] (or secondary research sources). In addition, we summarize the most important literature about energy to meet the clinical standards about energy supply. We discuss the different dietary patterns about energy supply. We describe the most important evidence on the most important factors about energy.\nIn addition health.\nWe discuss the most important factors about nutrition (and other factors about energy supply [20] and identify the most important factors about energy on the relevant factors about energy, which is the best dietary patterns important evidence [20] (or energy on the most important factors about energy to identify diets on the best diets on the most relevant aspects on energy [20] and identify the fact [energy] on energy on the most important factors about how to eat healthy food based diet [energy supply.\nof energy to identify how to provide evidence on energy on the most food on the most.\nenergy supply, the best energy on the most energy, which is energy off diets on energy to identify the most, which energy on the most energy nutrients on energy recommendations about energy supply the most energy on energy supply on the most energy on the most energy on energy on the most energy on.\nenergy on energy on diets on energy on it.

Nutrients are typically classified into macro and micronutrients. Vitamins are micronutrients that help control the physiological and cellular processes of an organism. Micronutrients can be found in many foods and are generally classified as essential vitamins, which must be taken in by humans in order for life to continue. There are two broad chemical classes of nutrients: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are found in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, with the latter two being the more common components of macronutrients. In addition, macronutrients are essential in the metabolism of lipids and proteins, the storage of important fat-soluble vitamins like choline and vitamin E, the production of energy, hormonal production, and normal growth, and function of body structures like skin, hairs, nails, skin, and bone. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals, most of which are needed in lesser quantities. Micronutrients play important roles in normal functioning and can be classified into those needed for general health, as well as those that affect particular metabolic processes. Both macro and micronutrients need to be balanced in order for overall body health to be in optimal condition, even if one is taking vitamin supplements in order to meet certain dietary requirements; yet, excess vitamins in foods can damage cells. Since vitamins are made up of different proportions of protein and fat, they require a different balance for proper functioning in the body. As such, dietitian nutritionists create specialized plans with each client to ensure that proper nutrients are provided; these plans include vitamin supplements, as well as specialized meals. Nutritional consulting includes both nutritional assessments (which are done to see which foods a person's body needs) and dietary planning, which are both done to ensure that people receive adequate calories to be able to sustain themselves. Dietitian nutritionists work closely with clients, and monitor their progress through nutrition assessments and diet plans. Dietitians are trained to provide individualized counseling on nutrition, and to recommend proper nutrition and diet patterns for people in order to improve health. Nutritional counseling includes both an individual and group counseling component, in which a dietitian talks with a client about different issues of nutrition, and provides advice and recommendations based on the individual's needs.\n14/01/2023 - 08:03\nWhat is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus?

Appendicitis symptoms usually appear suddenly. But there is also chronic appendicitis. In chronic appendicitis, the appendix does not rupture\nHow is appendicitis diagnosed in children?\nDiagnosis of appendicitis is mainly clinical, but CT and ultrasound scanning can also be used to diagnose it and determine the extent of the inflammation and infection, in addition to the presence of abscesses or other signs of infection.\nHow is appendicitis diagnosed?\nAcute appendicitis is diagnosed clinically through symptoms such as abdominal or right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, fever and abdominal girth. In order to check, you need to find an appendectomy and perform an ultrasound CT scan.\nWhat are the symptoms of appendicitis in adults?\nAppendicitis is the inflammation and subsequent rupture of a very small pouch located in a deep part of the abdomen. Appendicitis can occur at any age, but it is more common in adolescent and young adult and can manifest by the age of 25.

The pain occurs in the right upper part of the abdomen and extends to the back.\nWhat is the normal temperature of an appendix?\nThe appendix rarely requires surgery, but when it does, the condition may require an operation called an appendectomy, which involves removal of the appendix. The appendix's normal temperature is usually 39\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). Any higher than 100.3\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) would require treatment.\nWhat is the normal color of an appendix?\nThe normal temperature of the appendix is 38\u00b0F (35\u00b0C). Any higher than 100.3\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) requires prompt medical attention. The color of the appendix will change when this occurs.

You can relieve this pain by sleeping on the stomach or side, but this can also be uncomfortable. A neck pillow can help with your upper back pain. However, it should be comfortable and made of memory foam, so you can easily sleep on your side. Also, make sure your pillowcase is clean and hypoallergenic.\nHow to Find a Good Pillow Bed Online with Reviews\nIf you're looking for a good pillow bed online, you can find reviews of many pillows on websites like Reddit, which is a social news website. You can also find reviews of different models from many websites, including Amazon's customer reviews, and their ratings. While it's important to consider the size and shape of a bed when purchasing one, the material it's made of is just as important.\nWhat is a good foam pillow online with customer reviews to help you make an informed decision? This article will help you find the best pillow with positive reviews and customer feedback. We have compiled a list of 5 best pillows to choose from, plus tips on what to look for when choosing the best purchase.\nMemory Foam Pillows vs Gel Memory Foam Pillows\nA memory foam pillow is an extremely popular investment. The most important difference between the two is how they work to support your neck and back. Memory foam is made from polyurethane or latex, while gel memory foam is made from natural latex or polyurethane. In contrast, gel memory foam is less supportive, but offers more support over time.\nA memory foam pillow will mold to your body, which is good when you have trouble sleeping at night. However, a foam pillow can be uncomfortable because it creates pressure points that might cause back pain. On the other hand, a latex pillow will not produce pressure points, which is good for sleeping, but some people may prefer a gel pillow.\nFor example, memory foam pillows come without any in-built features. Therefore, it is easy to clean them. On the other hand, gel foam pillows have two parts: a base for stability and layers of memory foam for flexibility. However, this makes them more difficult to clean.\nWhen we say that a gel pillow feels more supportive than a memory foam pillow, the term 'more supportive' actually means that a gel pillow provides more comfort and convenience. This makes them ideal for people who struggle with back pain. But when it comes to memory foam and gel foam pillows, there is no clear winner. Some people like the flexibility of a gel foam pillow, while others want something more stable and supportive.\nIf you feel that memory foam pillows are not comfortable enough for your needs, you can opt for a gel foam pillow instead. It will provide you with a more comfortable sleep experience.", "num_tokens_generated": 677, "OGF": 0.165283203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 14.938560485839844, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 214, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

At 27, I left my career in advertising to teach English abroad for a year, then went back in and am now working on the other side; as a teacher, I am loving teaching more than ever since I never really found the challenge in my first teaching job. So for me, it was never about money, or status; it was always about the love of learning. So for me, I am more excited to get up everyday and teach, than I am getting paid.\nA good teacher can even see small things about a topic in order to explain to the students what these aspects are. For example, if he wants to talk about a book, you can make things interesting with pictures of the characters: what they looked like, how they wore their clothes or what their bodies were like. Teachers make the learning process interesting and students enjoy getting more and more deeply involved in it.\nIt is easy to overlook the value of nonfiction \u2014 that is, books and other materials that explain something. In many respects, nonfiction is more important than fiction because so many things have been written about so many things that many students can rely on nonfiction sources to learn skills they will need. Also, there is the potential for nonfiction to bring to students' experiences facts and images that they can relate to their lives.\nWhen you talk to a teacher, it\u2019s important to be direct. Don\u2019t go on and on about why you don\u2019t understand the material. Instead, tell the teacher your thoughts, the information you know, and the steps you have taken to learn a new concept. It\u2019s not about being a complete know-it-all. It simply is about how to better your learning process. Keep in mind, teachers are trained to learn how to be patient with their students, and they know that learning is difficult and not always linear.", "num_tokens_generated": 429, "OGF": 0.104736328125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 9.401482343673706, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 218, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

To, uh, let's consider the following tree. So that would be my tree. And now we're going to add to it, but what would happen if we removed it? So what we get is that, uh, tree is still there, but the, uh, verb that was missing in the sentence is removed. And that would make the sentences complete.\n8\nLet's consider the following sentence, this is a tree. So what's happened to to make this? That this is going to be a completed sentence. So let's think of it this way. So we have tree, and now we're going to add to it.\nBut for this sentence to actually make sense and to have a complete verb. It needs to have a verb like here. So let's add a verb. So I want to say like and then a verb. Then what we get is tree, like to.\nSo that makes the sentence complete now. Let's consider the following sentence. Uh, this is a tree. And what would have to happen in order for that sentence to make sense after changing it to this? Now let's think of it this way. So we have tree.\nAnd now we're going to add to it. But for this sentence to actually make sense and to have a complete verb. It needs to have a verb like like, like this here. So like to what would happen if we were to change it to like that? So that makes the sentence complete. Now let's consider adding another verb to the following sentence, this is tree like the following sentence, this is a tree to make the sentence complete.\nWe're going to say tree like what will be the sentence that would be complete with the verb like that? Let's think about that again. So we have a tree like and tree like what we get. That's complete so if we have a tree like and then another verb. Like what would have to change to make the sentence complete? Well, since two verbs now have been used, tree like like to what can we add to it to make it complete? Tree like like to we have the sentence, uh, tree, like, and then, uh, again like trees complete.\nSo in conclusion, let's look like for the different sentences we consider like what could be done to complete a sentence. So again, what could we add to the sentence this is a tree tree like to complete the sentence? If we had a verb? Yeah. It's very easy. Um, like that makes the sentence complete. Now let's consider one more tree.\nThe tree. So if we're going to complete the sentence tree, what could we add to it to make it complete? Yeah. I could add the verb want like tree Want. So that's what makes it complete. Right now let's consider adding the like phrase in the sentence and then we have tree.\nLike. Now if we were to add the verb, Want like tree like the want. Um what would be complete? What we get is tree like like to so that makes it complete.\n8\nSo for part a were given the sentence tree like, and then again like tree Like tree like like three like and then we saw like like on tree like like in sentence of three like like and then like again like tree Like like on sentence of three like like and then like. The third sentence of three like like and then like We have three like like in then like on sentence of three like like on like and then like. In sentence of three like like and then again like on sentence of sentence of tree. Like and then like on tree like like on sentence of sentence of tree like and then like on tree like like The fourth sentence of tree like and then again like tree like and then like on tree like like sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence.\nOkay, so for part B, so it's like this like this like three. So the only way to make this one complete is to go all the way down. So I'm going to go all the way to then like. I'm going to go all the way to then like to, uh, end the sentences. In this case, this is like a tree like on the tree like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of three like like on tree like like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of three like to in the tree like like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of tree.\nAnd then we saw like like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of tree Like, and then we still have tree. In this case, we still have three. Tree like, three trees, and then we still have three. All right. That's the tree like Like tree.\nLike on sentence of three like like in Sentence of three, like like on sentence of three like like in sentence of three like like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of.\n2\nAll right. For Part A, were given the following sentence tree. So if we add the verb want like tree Want we get the following sentence tree want like to And then three. So if we add the verb want like tree want, What we get is the following sentence tree want like and then three And if we were to complete this one, we have tree like and we add again. That means we have tree.\nLike we had to so we only have to complete this one and what we get is tree like like to So as we see in both of these sentences, we have tree. There are two verbs used in these sentences. Want like tree. And then want like tree and then want like three and then want like three. Okay, now let's consider completing the following sentence Tree three like and again like in this sentence.\nSo this is how it would be complete Tree, um like. So in this sentence we have three Tree. Like Three. So what we need here is a verb. Tree.\nIn this case, that means we have tree. Like three. And then like, and that's three and then like to So that means you have this one So this is how we add three because it doesn't have a verb to complete the sentence Now let's see this one right here. And if we added three. That means we have Tree like three like in this sentence.\nSo what do we have? Well, we have three. Like, and then also again like to and what we get tree. Like tree. Like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of tree. Like and then again like three like and again like three like and again like tree.\nLike, and then again like tree like, and then again like three like and again like and then like tree. Like, and then again like tree. Like and then again. Like on sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence of sentence the tree like, and then again like tree.

The company sells a similar software for a competitive product at a price of $14,000. The annual rate of inflation is 2%. The first year for the discount program is estimated to generate a profit of $24,000, which increases by $4,000 each year. The market research conducted by the management shows that the additional product line will generate sales of $360,000 per year after 5 years. After 5 years, the company expects the software to no longer generate profits. (a) What is the total cost of the software for nutrientOPT Exercise 1 after 5 years if the 8% discount is applied instead of the original $18,000 price? (b) Assuming that all of the revenue for the additional product line (with the 8% discount) will generate profits over the 5-year period; what is the approximate present value of the new product line if the discount rate is 8%? (c) Suppose that the decision maker estimates that the additional product line will not generate profits or at least will generate $40,000 losses over the 5-year period\u2014that is, the decision maker does not believe that the additional product will make a profit. If the 8% discount is applied, what is the approximate opportunity cost of not making the investment in the additional product? 5.

(b) Discuss which seasonality, the trend, or neither of these is evident in the graph. (c) Describe the cyclical behavior of the monthly data shown in Exhibit 8.15 \u201cHealth Food Mart.\u201d\n\n\u2022 May 12 '23 1:19A.M.\n\n(1) The company will generate profits if and only if their initial amount of financing exceeds the current value of the project(s). $90,000 is the minimum initial capital necessary to develop a product. (2) No, the expected profit (discounted back to the initial amount of financing) must exceed the initial amount of capital invested in the project. The expected profit will equal $1,236,000. To develop this project, you need $90,000 to start the project and then $1.2 million more (or just more than $36,000/month for 3 years). (3) Yes, the first year will be negative, but after that, the company is profitable (assuming the initial capital investment does not exceed the discounted value of the cash flows from the project). (4) Based on the information provided, it is not possible to tell how much return you expect. However, based on the information provided, it is possible to compute the NPV of this particular project. You can then use an appropriate discounting technique to compute the appropriate NPV. This can be used to provide a comparison with other projects with the same structure (i.e., same initial capital investment and cash flows). If you have more than 1 project with the same structure in your portfolio, your calculation will be specific to that project only.\n\n\u2022 Mark\n\n1. (1) The internal rate of return for the project is greater than the project NPV (assuming you use the NPV method to measure return). Therefore, they should expand their product line by purchasing the new software. Although the project NPV is negative, it is likely that the incremental product would have a positive NPV if purchased, indicating that they are better off purchasing the software. (2) The present value of the new product line is negative based on the assumption that the discount rate of 8% is used. If the incremental revenue from the additional product line is projected to grow by $4,000 per year, the expected present value of the revenue is $179,000, indicating that there are negative NPV\u2019s for all 6 years. (3) There are negative NPV\u2019s after the 3rd year because the company expects the software will no longer generate profits by the 5th year. 2. This is the NPV from the new product line (assuming the new product line will also have revenue increases): $360,000 \u2013 $360,000 $19,200 \u2013 ( ( ) ) 1 360 , 000 5 . 24 24 , 000 360 , 000 ( 4,000 ) 2 3,470,000 \u2013 2,7933.4700 . 000 1,676,531 PV = (1.16) = =2,389,880 NPV = \uf053 0,000,00 1 (b) (c)\n\n\u2022 Mark\n\n1. The total cost of the software ($800,000) should be the initial cost of 18,000 units plus the cost of future units to bring the inventory up to 800 units (240,000). 2. (a) It would be difficult to compare project returns with NPV because NPV measures the overall return across all years. Comparing IRR with NPV would, however, enable you to compare the returns on the new project with the return on the old project. Since the IRR for the new project is greater than the IRR for the old project, the new project should be accepted if the discount rate is less than 8%. Because the discount rate is greater than 8%, the company should not select the new project. (b) It is not possible to determine this without the price of the goods sold for the new product. (c) The difference between the original 18,000 units and 800 units was an opportunity cost of 36,000. It would be possible to take into account that the opportunity that the firm had by accepting the new project instead of the old should represent something else than the cost of acquiring the software.\n\n\u2022 karen\n\n4. (a) As the graph demonstrates, the number of consumer visits peaks in the fall months and is lowest in the summer months. Therefore, the company should set marketing plans so that its advertising matches the most demand periods (e.g., by placing a lot of focus on summer periods (May-August)). (b) In the fall months, there are more consumers visiting\u2014and they shop more frequently. In the summer, there are fewer consumers visiting\u2014and they go more infrequently. (c) The average monthly volume of customer visits appears to be the most constant over the period of 6 months (based on the trendline). The company\u2019s growth in 2013 was driven by a higher visit frequency in summer.

You can also use nutrientOPT lavish to create your own DIY recipes!\nWhat are some of the other possible elements or qualities? These would include the quality of the lyrics, the level of meaning the lyrics convey, and the way in which the lyrics are delivered or performed. Each element is a crucial component of the song, which is why they are categorized as songwriting elements. In the first section of this article, we explored the significance of chord progression and verse/chorus arrangement as songwriting elements. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these elements and their role in the song.\nChord progression is one of the most important songwriting elements. A chord progression tells the listener the mood and feeling of the song. The chord progression also tells the listener what\u2019s going to happen in the song. It can also convey the narrative of the song and set the mood for what\u2019s to come. One of the most common chord progressions used in songs is the A minor / C major / F major. This chord progression is often used in pop and rock songs, and it sets a generally happy tone for the song.\nThe verse and chorus arrangement is another important songwriting element. The verse and chorus arrangement tells the audience what\u2019s going to happen in the song and how it relates to the message. The verse and chorus arrangement also conveys the story or the message of the song. If the verse and chorus are done in a way that makes sense, it can create a deeper connection with the audience. The verse and chorus arrangement is often the key to the success of a song.\nAnother songwriting element is the song structure. A song structure is the layout of the song. The song structure is often based on a simple, four-beat pattern. The song structure can also be based on a more complex, six or even eight-beat pattern. The song structure can also be based on specific musical passages or phrases in the song. The song structure is an important element of a song, as it\u2019s the foundation for the rest of the song. The structure of a song should be simple and easy to follow. It should also give the audience a feeling of closure and resolution.\nAnother important songwriting element is the tempo. Tempo is the speed at which the music is played. The tempo can also be considered the \u201cfeel\u201d of the song. A tempo of 120 beats per minute is considered moderately fast. A tempo below 100 is considered fast, and a tempo above 140 is considered slow. The tempo of a song is important because it determines how the song sounds and how it makes the audience feel. The tempo of the song should match the mood or feeling of the song. If the song\u2019s tone is serious or dramatic, it should have a slower tempo. If the song\u2019s tone is playful or humorous, it should have a faster tempo.\nThe last songwriting element is the melody. Melody is the key to the happiness of the song. The melody should be catchy and memorable, and it should convey the feelings or emotions of the song. The melody is often accompanied by harmony, which is the backing instrument that makes the melody sing. The melody and harmony should work together to create a harmony feel. The melody should also be a catchy and memorable part of the song, so it should be easy to remember.\nWhat are some of your favorite songs? What elements do you think make them great? What is your favorite song from the song collection? Why do you think it\u2019s so great? How do you feel listening to or singing the song? What is the meaning of the lyrics? How do they relate to what you\u2019re listening to? How would you say that the song is important to me?

Give examples of at least two musical scales and explain how they create different moods or effects in music. Describe the different scales and harmonies that are used in traditional blues and rock and roll music. Describe the music of a cappella vocal groups using a variety of scales. In addition to the melodic intervals described in Part 2 (b), describe other melodic intervals you can hear, like leaps, glissandi, slurs, trills. Musical scales and harmonic modes are at the basis of western music, the major scale being the primary one (A=440 Hz or A440) and it has had a massive impact on classical, contemporary and popular music. All western music is based on a scale that derives from that one. This scale is essentially a scale of 7 notes played in ascending order followed by descending order. To determine if a song is based on a certain key, there are a series of steps which are followed and which will be demonstrated in this assignment through the example songs of Jimi Hendrix\u2019 \u201cRed House\u201d and \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d (Bob Dylan). When using the \u201cRed House\u201d example and the \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d example, we need a little bit of background knowledge before proceeding to the analysis so to help you grasp the concepts, we need to understand and analyse the basics of harmonic analysis, pitch hierarchy, and how that is applied to music. This will be covered in Parts 2 and 3 of the assignment (b) to (d). [pic] Step 1: To analyse the notes of each song, we need to determine all of the notes, this can be by reading or with the help of a piano keyboard. For example, the first 10 notes of \u201cRed House\u201d are as follows: D3 E3 F#3 G3 A3 B3 C#4 D4 E4 F#4 Step 2: Next, you need to figure out the root note of the scale\u2026 \n2180 words - 9 pages\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC TO OUR DAILY LIVES Essay\nIn 500 b.c., Pythagoras wrote a treatise about the sound quality of a trumpet which went on to develop the idea of musical tuning as well as the method of the scientific study of music. Pythagoras is best known as the first man to have tried to formulate a theory using physics. He said that if we want to know the purity of a sound, then we multiply sound by its opposite which has the same pitch. That is what I have learnt. I think that Pythagoras is a very important man in the history of science. The importance of this man is the way he thinks and applies music theory that he created into practice. This shows how the idea that was originally conceived in ancient Greece has taken up root and developed into the discipline of music theory. What I found most surprising about Pythagoras was that he created his own musical theory and applied it successfully. He used physics to study sound. He used the vibration to create pure sounds. He came up with the ideas of musical tuning by using a triangle that he called as the pentatonic scale. He also had the law of the \u201cwhole, whole, half\u201d that has been used in composition to describe musical intervals and is the principle of the musical tuning. In addition to Pythagoras\u2019 invention that was the precursor of music theory, the man also has another musical theory which is the musical temperament. This musical theory is based on the way in which the frequencies that are related to each other. The musical temperament that Pythagoras came up with was a way to determine the way the different instruments produce the... \n2123 words - 9 pages\nL\u2019ART DE L\u2019AUDIENCE- EVALUATION MUSICALE 2014-2015/ Evaluation Musicale 2014-2015\nL'art de l'audition 1\\. 2\\. 3\\. 4\\. 5\\. 6\\. 7\\.

I\u2019m so proud of you and it was so awesome to see you again in LA this week \u2013 I\u2019m so blessed to know YOU!\nYou have been an inspiration my whole life!\nLove you!\nThis totally made me cry (so great to see that picture)! I had the same fear when going to the doctors to discuss using a Depo shot so I feel for you & am so thankful you finally gave them the information you had about it!\nLove this post so much! You have a great attitude about it. I would love nothing more than to not have to worry about a period any more.\nYour post brought me to tears! I can\u2019t wait for the day I can get rid of my period. It\u2019s a constant reminder of just how long I\u2019ve been out of college. *insert happy tears here*\nI had such faith in Dr. Weese that I agreed to fill my prescription for Nexplanon. I know you\u2019ve seen this story before, but I hope you can help all the other women who are considering going on this and are afraid. I had an ultrasound and a consultation, he didn\u2019t even say what the actual procedure was like. He just said that this is one of the better methods for removing the ovarian tissue. But he assured me that he wouldn\u2019t get into it too many details because it\u2019s a medical procedure. After he assured me that it is very painless, I decided to go for it. I was very hesitant (even after you talked to me about Nexplanon), but I knew that the pain of having to take the pill daily was much worse than the pain I would feel after my ovaries would be removed. At the ultrasound, Dr. Weese told me that he had taken in many requests for this procedure and that he actually likes that everyone is so comfortable. He doesn\u2019t really give a lot of details in his office, so it\u2019s nice that women understand it and that he takes the time to prepare them. My surgery was Thursday and I will be 31 Friday! Thanks again!\nWhen I was asked a few months ago about wanting a \u201cpregnancy free\u201d marriage, I just thought it was kind of dumb.\nBut now that my husband and I are thinking about kids at age 34, it makes perfect sense!\nWhat a good reminder for this woman with the cancer. Thank God for men that love their wives, and for the wives that don\u2019t get caught up in the fear of all natural things and don\u2019t give up your own freedom and power for the good of the man that loves you. God has blessed, the wife that does not worry.\nLove you, my friend\nThank you for sharing this! Thank you for sharing your story. I have been struggling with the cycle questions as well. I went to my doctor about a month ago to ask the same thing and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking questions you shouldn\u2019t be!\u201d I wish there was something to give up. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m so happy you have a book though.\nHi Kari,\nJust wanted to reach out. I understand going to my doc and having them tell me they will do something that you want but don\u2019t know if you can trust them and how they will do it. This past year I was having symptoms of pervious preganancy and I didn\u2019t know if it was the ovaries or I was depressed or if it was cancer. I had a couple of tests done for pregnancy and they came back negative. I found out after they did the tests that I had cancer. It was difficult to accept as I was expecting a lot and my husband loved children. I had been trying for some time and I wanted so badly to be able to have them and that\u2019s where we are. When I got the cancer I was so concerned about it spreading. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t have the fear anymore and I have my health back. You can have whatever you want and as long as you make sure you take good care of your body it will do what you want with it. What does cancer have to do with fertility! All I\u2019m saying is that you have to trust you doctor. I\u2019ve seen that too much in our family. I\u2019m blessed to be healthy and able to have a healthy relationship with my children. Blessings!\nHi Kari!\nThanks so much for posting about your book. It has brought tears to my eyes a few times already. It\u2019s so encouraging to read through the stories in your book.\nDo you have a Facebook Group that\u2019s dedicated to your book? I would love to join it! I\u2019ll be sharing your Facebook page link with my friends, so they\u2019ll get it right away!\nLove you!\nThank you Kari. I am going to your event today and hope you do a book signing. As soon as I was reading your story, I could see the similarities in my own. I too am scared of not being able to get pregnant after my ovaries are removed. I have been trying for 3+ years and I have not started trying again. One of my worst fears. Thank you for being open, honest and sharing your story. Bless you for making the best of some of the most challenging things life can offer. xox\nI loved your article! I\u2019ve been thinking similar things lately and am thankful to live in a country where a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body.\nI have my tubes tied next week and I\u2019m so excited! (Also thankful it\u2019s a little less than 2 weeks before my period.)\nAnd this is so helpful-I don\u2019t know where I would find the info on how to do it myself or the possible risks and benefits.\nThis is a wonderful article. As a woman in a country that does not give women the right to choose, I am thankful for my country, culture, and society that is so thankful that they have these choices. This is very encouraging!\nI was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 4 years ago. But I had already had treatment for my fallopian tubes (which was recommended before my actual diagnosis).\nSo my fallopian tubes have been gone for a long, long time!\nThankfully I\u2019m in remission right now, and not worried about my future fertility either!\nThis is great Kari! I was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer and I had fallopian tubes when the doctors told me they had removed them for me. I am so encouraged by your story and just want to say I am thankful you had your tubes removed and that you know where they\u2019ve been! I wish you much courage in this next transition.\nI\u2019ve been told the same. I had my tubes removed when I was 28 because I had an abnormal fallopian tube ultrasound with an enlarged salivary gland and my onco- surgeon was concerned about that. The doctor did not tell me that he had removed both tubes for me, and I assumed it was something else. That was 3 years ago. I was trying for my first child and was told by friends that I should get the tubes tied if I didn\u2019t feel like I was getting pregnant. The doctor told me I could get pregnant with 1 tube but not the other so that I should try and don\u2019t get it tied. So I started trying and when I didn\u2019t get pregnant I did an ultrasound for reasons other than my tubes, and he told me at the time I should get it tied. So that\u2019s what I did. When I was in the hospital and they removed my tubes, I had no idea they had already been removed for me. I actually thought my tubes had been removed for health reasons, which is why the ovarian cancer came to be.\nI had my tubes removed at 34\u2026. I was afraid to get pregnant again after my hysto! I\u2019m so happy your are going to be okay!\nThis is so encouraging to read. I had my tubes and ovaries removed for another diagnosis last August. I\u2019m currently in a 2 and a half year long journey with remission, but I still face fear of the future. I\u2019m glad that I had a choice so that I could have this conversation with myself and in turn my amazing husband as well.\nI still have feelings of sadness that I am losing the ability to have children, but know that my children are already blessed to have a mother that is both whole and alive. I\u2019m also thankful that I had a choice to be proactive as opposed to reactive to my situation, which allowed me to be more clear at the time of my diagnosis and treatment.\nThank you for sharing your story.\nI had the same conversation w/ my doctor: \u201cshould I go ahead and have my tubes tied?,\u2019 to which she responded with, \u2018Well, yes, if you want to\u2019. I went ahead and did it then, not expecting to have to go back and ask again, or for it to be taken away. I don\u2019t want to lose it either, but I\u2019ve been told (not all by the same doctor) that it is possible to lose pregnancies and if not, I\u2019m not \u201cwasting\u201d it\u2026 but I don\u2019t feel that way. I would love to be pregnant, but not if it comes at the expense of my health. So, while I am excited to be able to tell my children, \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d if I\u2019m cancer-free, I am also saddened at the thought of not being able to have a child on my own and would love to use fertility treatments that have worked for other women like me\u2026. if they exist. It will still be a challenge to convince my doc I would like them to be on record in my medical record, but if I can get them to sign a non-disclosure/ non-interference form, I can request my insurance pay for the treatments. I do know that it\u2019s possible to reverse the effects of ovarian cancer (or to remove tumors before they get to large and to prevent the need to remove the tissue) and there are companies like the Center for Reproductive Health that do hope to develop treatments for women with cancer. I am praying for all women diagnosed even in the early stages in a timely manner, as I truly believe this cancer is being diagnosed before it needs to be because of women having early access to testing. I am not angry that more isn\u2019t known about it and what the long-term effects are, but sad, since it has been that knowledge that has put so many in a position to lose their lives to this disease over the past 3 years. If any changes are made and the tests are more widely available, I wonder if the treatments will be too, including for cancerous ovary tissue or \u201cwomb\u201d treatments. We can\u2019t afford to lose anymore women to cancer from lack of information. So many stories exist that show these treatments CAN help (or has helped) those who have needed them so badly and should be considered even if they do not cure, as they may prevent the need for removal of the tissue.\nIf I can do it, you can do it. I am so glad you have your book out, have peace and comfort in all of this pain.\nI had my fallopian tubes removed because of a hysterosalpingogram and my ovaries removed 3 years ago. Since then I am completely off all birth control and I have felt a definite peace. I am 45. My husband is very supportive. I have had no real troubles finding out I\u2019m pregnant and since last year with a high school reunion we\u2019ve had friends get married. There\u2019s always been the concern that I could have had a stroke, but since I take no birth control and get my blood work up to date I really haven\u2019t worried. I have been told that if I\u2019m not worried they probably shouldn\u2019t give a big thump up in the back. I am so glad you\u2019ll be okay if all goes well. Keep that glass of water on hand for those nervous moments.\nI had a hysterosalpingogram and my tubes were taken out in april 2014. At 36 and after five miscarriages, I was hoping desperately for the miracle that was waiting to happen, but I didn\u2019t know that it could all be taken away for good. I was so close\u2026 my periods were getting lighter and I was getting really excited, then my doctor (who was supposed to take my tubes out the day after the procedure!) told me the following morning that he would get them out on a follow up visit on May 20. But when I got home, I felt really good for the first time in a while\u2026 so I called my husband to tell him that I thought it was just a fluke, and that things were going really well. So a few days later, I am starting to get my period, and I get a call from my husband,\u201dwhat time did your appointment with the nurse that did the operation to take out your tubes at school.\u201d I am terrified as to what my answer will be! I call\u2026 I get a voicemail of the nurse who did my procedure and the message goes that I have a 30 minute follow up with Dr D\u2026. I start sobbing on the phone crying like a baby. So I call my husband again and I just tell him in tears that the nurse is saying that something may be wrong\u2026 I can\u2019t believe how much courage it takes for you to say \u201cI don\u2019t want them cut out because the baby will be gone.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you what a relief it was. I am 27 days late and the little girl that we\u2019ve prayed for and dreamed about and hoped for so much is a girl. It was one of the proudest moments of my life, when they told me she is a girl! I am so thankful God put her in my arms and in my heart, and I only hope He will heal my tubes and restore my health so that I will once again have the miracle of pregnancy. It will be wonderful when I can tell my children that there were no tubes in my body for over a year! God bless you for sharing your heart and your story. We need to hear the voices of others that don\u2019t look just like us and have been through the same kinds of things.\nHi Kari! I have had my tubes tied and it feels like a dream! I am so thankful to have it out of my body and feel so much better after that! I was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. It was the scariest thing I have ever been through, but through the whole process the Lord has been so good! I can\u2019t wait for the day I found out I was pregnant \ud83d\ude42\nI am really encouraged by your story! This will be a blessing I am sure!\nWhen my first baby was born in May 2004, I knew she would be my last. I knew I didn\u2019t want to have any more, because the more I gave, the more I felt empty. We found out after my first baby I had a couple of miscarriages. They were in our daughter\u2019s womb when she turned 8.\nMy husband is not the type that is \u201cafraid\u201d that I would suffer anymore if we wanted a child. I am happy that we can talk openly about our decisions \u2013 and that he always supports them. I am lucky enough to be able to have a second career that I love at the moment \u2013 but being that this is my dream and I do want to be a stay at home mom, I had to reconfirm that I am able to be one.\nMy heart aches for your fears and hopes and heartache. But I also know that your hopes and dreams are so good and that this will be a beautiful journey.\nThank you so much for sharing that, it brought me to tears.\nI am in the process of getting my tubes tied and had a huge bout of fear/anxiety the day before surgery. If all goes well, I will have no ovaries to worry about in the future. It is so freeing to know you can never have a uterus pregnancy again but also the possibility that one day, I could get pregnant the old fashioned way with a baby daddy. You are a wonderful encouragement, thank you Kari.\nThank you!\nI had my tubes removed about 18 months ago after surgery for other reasons and I could never stop telling myself \u201cmy life with my children\u2026.\u201d but I keep telling myself to trust that my children will know I love them and will care for them with the same fervor as I did. Even if I have to put them down to take another life to replace one that has passed away. Not to make my husband feel any different though, he is one hundred percent on board. I love you and your family Kari and will go so far to encourage you even though my life isn\u2019t as you wish it could be. I love that your husband was brave and said out loud what everyone in my head had been saying, that you don\u2019t have to have your tubes tied, but rather if you want to. I know that I feel the same when I ask if I can still have my tubewells tested for cancer, if I say yes I will likely never know if it\u2019s a real cancer or my body\u2019s way of saying you\u2019re getting old\u2026.but if you want, you can take it. I am so scared that after my tubes are removed that I will have another surgery just to have everything removed because they don\u2019t look good\u2026.but that is when the doctor says \u201cno, you\u2019re fine\u201d and your insurance will cover it cause you have cancer. I don\u2019t know I am just so thankful for life but scared that it ends so soon. Thank you again for letting them hear these stories because it helps us know we\u2019re not alone. I pray it will all work out for you.\nPhew, so glad God brought me across blogs like this. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting my tubes tied as I\u2019ve been trying (and failing) to get pregnant for a long while. My husband never wanted it in the first place because he wanted to know what would happen should we ever get pregnant naturally. But, after reading so much about the risks and complications, especially my age, and that he\u2019s pretty sure if I get pregnant it\u2019ll be through IVF/egg donation, and that I\u2019ll be taking medication, I said the prayer of \u201cLord, if your will be, then please do.\u201d and got the blessing from my doctor after only a few minutes of talking. I was so relieved and so glad I was able to talk it through with him first so he had the chance to express whatever he needed to and could prepare me for it\u2026\nMy husband and I found out we were pregnant the day after we visited my first-grader with some back pain. I went to the doctor the next day and the doctor said that there was a possibility we could be miscarrying due to some of the early symptoms of pregnancy. It was the scariest time in my life. Since then, we have been through two miscarriage (last one at 4 months, and I miscarried at 13 weeks) . After that I never took the \u201cI hope we\u2019re pregnant soon\u201d type of attitude anymore because I would lose my second child if I was pregnant again. I was always the type of person that was afraid to lose a child. I would have been just as afraid if my baby were dying right now. After this, I have developed a stronger faith in God\u2019s plan. I\u2019m learning that God\u2019s plans for us are the very best ones \u2014 we don\u2019t deserve to have children!!! I always felt that I was so unlucky to be denied one. I know for some of my friends that have been going through the same thing. Thank you for being able to write something down \u2013 it keeps your fears at a healthier level. I\u2019m so grateful it all women who have all the courage to have the chance to speak to someone on the spot to tell my wife and son-in law school.\nSo pleased and amazed.

He was also directly insulting the majority of White voters, and the Democrats still had absolutely no fucking shit together.\n\nAnd that's the endgame, and Trump is smart enough to know it. And also the fact that the only thing preventing him getting in jail right now is all the money that he has spent and the fact that he doesn't have that much money.

In nutrientOPT alien", "generated_output": "i can be used for the development of non-linear control systems that are subjected to uncertain control parameters and uncertain dynamics. The problem of nonlinear control of uncertain systems is in fact a well-known subject and has been dealt with in a great variety of problems. But it is more and more common to come across this problem in the context of food technology. When, for example, a process is designed it is hardly ever the aim to have linear systems. In these problems the aim is to obtain a control system which is robust in the sense that all uncertainties can be handled by the control system. Because the control system must also be robust a linear control system in not sufficient to cope with all the difficulties [2, 3].\nIn the work presented here we have considered an uncertain system which is composed of an uncertain part (nutrientOPT) embedded in a robust part. We have formulated a model where the nonlinear control problem is transferred over to a linear estimation problem. In [7] the concept of nutrientOPT is applied at various problems. In particular, the problem is set up for estimation from an uncertain plant model, of which one component is the nutrientOPT algorithm [5, 6]. In [5] the estimation problem is treated for use with a batch reactor as the first part of the plant model. In the second part the control problem of a CSTR is considered. In [6] estimation and control is combined in a single problem. The result is a CSTR where control of the concentration of the product is used within the control loop and estimation of the feed rate is used within the estimation loop. The idea of estimation and control combined is a promising idea. More research regarding this idea is needed to find out if some of the difficulties reported during the application of nutrientOPT in other industries can also be found in the context of estimation and control combined.\nIn this paper, we have developed the concept of nutrientOPT with additional information regarding the control parameters (or control variables). The aim of the present paper is to show that a certain uncertainty in the control parameters can be incorporated in a nutrientOPT estimator and to show that this gives a substantial increase of the robustness of the control system. The development of nutrientOPT with additional control parameters has as a basis the estimation algorithm of [6] to which we have transferred the control problem. This development is used for one specific example (section 4), where we present the results of three control cases. In section 3 we describe the estimation problem. Section 2 contains the introduction.\n\n#### 2.1 Unreliable data in estimation and control combined\nThe nutrientOPT application described in this paper is used to predict and control the concentrations of several substances in a system where these substances appear under differing conditions on separate occasions. In estimation and control combined we have to estimate the concentrations of the substances in the process, but the concentration of the substances cannot be measured accurately, because only parts of the substance appear in the measurement. In nutrientOPT we can take this inaccuracy into account by using a method for estimating an optimal uncertainty set that is based on the uncertainty in the process. The nutrientOPT algorithm is thus used to determine a set of the concentrations which are allowed within the measurement uncertainty. This means that information from the measurements, and from the process, is used to estimate these tolerances. With this estimate at hand a control system can be designed. The control problem is solved using a classical LTR model and with the estimates by the nutrientOPT algorithm as the data which defines the disturbances. To this end we set up the LTR model in [7] a little differently than usual.\nFor estimation and control combined we also have two kinds of uncertain information: 1) the measurement noise, i.e. the measurement uncertainty, and 2) the uncertainty in the disturbance which is caused by the unreliability of the process parameters. The measurement noise is often modelled as an additive noise with Gaussian distributions with a given mean and variance. This means that a distribution with Gaussian statistics can express everything that is know about the uncertainty, and a distribution of 95% coverage will give us a 95% confidence interval for the concentration.\nUnfortunately there is no universal method for the determination of the distributions. It is a difficult task because a great deal of experience have to be brought into play, and the knowledge of the process and its operation is necessary. To put it differently, the problem of estimation and control combined is that there is not enough information to make accurate decisions. Therefore many methods have been introduced to cope with uncertainties to meet this problem. A number of methods have been developed for the modelling of uncertainties, and among these methods the most popular are the moment method, the second moment method and the LTR method. These methods have been used in combination with the nutrientOPT algorithm to control several estimation and control problems, and with good results [7-10].\nThe second kind of uncertain information is the unreliability in the control parameters. This has been treated in [11] where a process control algorithm for an object such as the measurement process in Fig. 1. In the process, some measurement may be taken in parallel with other measurements or activities which may lead to a loss of information. We have no access to all the information of the system. The parameters of the object and related parameters are also uncertain because of the unreliability of the system under study. For instance: \"In a plant with one hundred thousand active parts there are several places where several chemical reactions take place, and the parameters defining the chemical reactions are uncertain\" [11]. This means that if we can only measure one part of the object, there is uncertainty in the parameters. The uncertainty is the cause that the estimation problem and the control problem have to be solved based on a robust model. Because the model may be robust we have to find other means to analyse this influence. In the model we have assumed that there will be a large number of uncertain parameters causing uncertainty in the model. In our application of the model we only have one uncertain parameter which causes uncertainty in the model.\n**Figure 1.** Measurement process [7]\nThe problem with uncertainties in the control system is that the resulting model is a nonlinear and discrete system, and the solution to the resulting estimation problem and the resulting control problem has to be found based on a robust model because the actual model parameters are unknown. There may be different ways of dealing with a situation like this. In this work we shall propose a particular form for solving this problem. It will be shown that by making a reasonable assumption regarding some of the disturbance parameters we can achieve better robustness in the control system and we can reach a better control result.\n\n#### 2.2 Description of the nutrientOPT algorithm\nAs mentioned above, the nutrientOPT algorithm can be used to find the allowed variations of the control parameters. A robust model of the control system is constructed based on the nutrientOPT algorithm, see [8, 9]. We start with the plant structure **P** in Fig. 2, and the measurement system in Fig. 2. As mentioned above, we assume that only one part of the chemical reaction process, for the sake of simplicity, is measured: the concentration of the product. The measurement is influenced by the process parameters _u_ _P_ , and by the measurement noise ( _v_ _0_ ) with a random distribution such as the Gaussian distribution. The measurement noise _v_ _0_ is also related to the process ( _u_ _P_ ), but this relationship is defined outside of the estimation loop. The actual information to define this relationship is the uncertainty and the disturbance. A part of the system is called an uncertain part and the uncertainties and disturbances are taken to be uncertain variables in this part of the system. The uncertain part of the process is called **Q** in Fig. 2 and the parameters are _f_ _Q_ which is the process uncertainty and the parameters related to the unreliability in the measurements.\n**Figure 2.** Measurement process with the nutrientsOPT algorithm applied to the measurement and the estimation and control problem in Fig. 1\nThe nutrientOPT algorithm is a method which uses information from the measurement of an unknown variable to determine the uncertainty in the variable. To do this we need the control and modelling parameters to have values which correspond to a Gaussian normal distribution. With this we assume that the disturbances _f_ _Q_ are Gaussian normally distributed.\nThe uncertainties in the parameters of the process can be described by the vector \u2208 in Fig 1, which contains the uncertainties in both the control and disturbance parameters. But the real values are unknown, so there are estimates \u2208 _n_ of the parameters for the model. These can be used in a robust model as\nThe uncertainty in the model is incorporated in the estimation problem **E** in Fig. 3, _E_ (\u2208) is the distribution of the uncertainties and _E_ (\u2208 _n_ ) is the distribution of the parameter estimates of the uncertainties. In Fig. 3 the model of the measurement process has been split into two parts and the parameter estimate is taken into account in the design of an estimator. The estimation problem for the control system is defined by the block **D** which consists of an estimator, a control system and the measurement.\n**Figure 3.** NutrientOPT algorithm diagram [5, 6]\nThe problem of estimation and control combined is solved with the following structure:\nIn Figure 4, the result of the nutrientOPT algorithm has been used to update the measurements and to create a new measurement noise. The block **U** is the nutrientOPT algorithm and the information is the concentration of the product and two estimates: the estimate of the concentration of the product and the estimate of the process parameters. The uncertainty in the process parameters and in the measurement process is introduced into the process by means of uncertainty in the control measurements. This is in the structure of the process the same as the measurement uncertainty and measurement noise. In an ideal situation these measurements have to be taken simultaneously, or almost simultaneously. This means that the uncertainty in the control measurements is related to the uncertainty in the measurement. This will give a robust structure in the problem. But in reality the control parameters and measurements are taken at different times, and this gives an unreliability in the control parameters and the measurements. This is described in Fig. 3.\n**Figure 4.** The structure of the estimation and control problem with the nutrientOPT algorithm applied\nIn Fig. 4 we have set up the algorithm such that the information to solve the problem in Fig. 1 is transferred from **D** to **K**. To improve the robustness in the control system the unknown _f_ _P_ of the control system is changed to _a_ _K_ which in this case is equal to _f_ _R_.\nThis means that _a_ _K_ will be a new control system and we assume that the control system has at least the following characteristics: 1) the control system is not linear, but has a small nonlinear term, 2) the system is time variant or time varying and 3) disturbances may occur.\nTo improve the performance of the nutrientOPT algorithm, and in this case to improve the control, a simple linearization was used, and with this we assume that the model which describes the process is close to the real situation. On one hand the process is nonlinear, and on the other hand with the assumption that the system is time variant or time varying we can reduce the disturbances to a small nonlinear term. Therefore, we expect that this simple linearization will give a relatively good result, the actual result for the control depends of course on the disturbances, and therefore there is also the possibility that this very simple linearization gives a bad result. When the linearization has the form:\n\n#### 2.3 LTR\nLTR is a method developed for the estimation problem [12], and when applied to the estimation problem the estimator can be used as an identification algorithm [13]. Therefore it is necessary for us to introduce the estimation problem into the estimation and control problem. The estimation problem contains information in the form of a probability distribution ( _P_ ) of the possible values of each process variable ( _x_ ), which gives a relation between the parameters that are taken into account ( _z_ ) and the process variables. The objective of the LTR estimation is to estimate these parameters ( _z_ ) from the data ( _y_ ) using a statistical model, where _h_ ( _x_ , _u_ , _z_ ) represents the plant dynamics, and _Q_ is the measurement process noise vector. The information about the error is expressed by _P_ , and the information about the process variables ( _x_ ) is expressed by _R_. With this we can use the LTR to solve the nutrientOPT algorithm in a similar way as we introduce the perturbation in the control problem.\nThe LTR of [12] is used, with some modifications, in the estimation problem in Fig. 5: the estimation problem is divided into a model **M** and the measurement model **F**. In [14] an application of the LTR to the estimation problem is presented. In the paper [14] the model **M** is considered to be known and therefore the estimation problem is transformed such that the estimate ( _x_ ) is independent of the model ( _M_ ). This can be done by solving the model with **M** ( _x_ _=0)_. This transform gives the model _F_ ( _k_ ) which can be used to solve the estimation problem without using the model **M** 2. In Fig. 5 **E** ( _x_ _=_ 1), **E** ( _z_ _=_ 2) and **E** ( _x_ _R_ _=_ 3) is used to model the perturbation ( _x_ , _z_ ) and the control parameter ( _u_ ), both in the model **M** and in the measurement _Q_. _E_ ( _x_ _R_ ) is used to solve the problem with the measurement noise as _E_ ( _Q k_). In this paper two different LTR-estimators have been implemented: the simple LTR-algorithm described in [12] and an improved LTR-algorithm based on the approach in [14]. These two algorithms has been tested and the results were compared in [12, 13].\n**Figure 5.** The structure of the estimation problem with the LTR algorithm\n\n### 3\\. Estimation problem\nThe model describing the process in Fig. 2 is defined by the relation [15]:\nwhere the output ( _P_ ) is the concentration of the product, the input is the concentration of the substrate, the control parameters _u_ _P_ _=_ [ _u_ _P1_ _u_ _P2_ ]T, ( _u_ _1_ is the change in product flow (kg*s-1) and _u_ _2_ is the change in substrate flow (kg*s-1/s-2)) and the measured disturbances are _v_ _0_ and _v_ _1_. _v_ _0_ _i_ is the process noise, and _v_ _1_ _i_ is the unreliability in the measurements.\n\n#### 3.1 Development of the nutrientOPT estimator and nutrientOPT + LTR\nThe development is based on the assumptions made for the estimation algorithm described in [6]. The first part of the plant model in Fig. 3 is a stochastic model which has the form\nwhere \u2208 [2] describes the unreliability in the control parameter.\n\n#### 3.1.1 The nutrientOPT algorithm\nThe following section contains a description and an analysis of the nutrientOPT algorithm presented in [5, 6]. First we describe the development of the nutrientOPT algorithm, which is used to model the estimation uncertainty.\nLet  = the measurement set ([ _P_ ]T is the concentration of the product and [ _u_ _P2_ ]T is the concentration of the substrate) and _=0_ is the measurement uncertainty (it will be seen later that this is estimated [5, 6, 8]). Let also **I** = \u2208 _0 T_.\n\n##### 3.1.1.1 The nutrient process\nThe measurement process can be described by a normal distribution N (\u03bc, \u03c32), where \u03bc and \u03c32 are the mean and the variance respectively. This normal distribution can be written like this:\nwhere _\u03bc_ is the mean (in our case \u03bc=[ _f_ _R_ _f_ _Q_ ]T = [ _u_ _P_ _+f_ _Q_ _T_ ] and \u03b5 is a random number with normal distribution N (), where \u03b42 is the variance.\nLet\n(3.1.1) \n(3.1.2) \nThe nutrientOPT estimation algorithm uses a nonlinear process which is divided into two parts as shown in Figure 4. The nutrient process is used to create a new distribution of the measurement noise. Let a control parameter **Q** be defined by \u2208 _T_. The measurement is defined by _\u03bc_ = _E_ ( **R** ) + \u2208 _P_. The nutrient process is set up such that the concentration measurements of the product are used in two ways:\n1) the measurement value is the mean of the new distribution where \n2) the measurement value is the mean of the estimation uncertainty and the measurement noise, \nThe uncertainty in the concentration measurements may be defined by the estimation problem, and an uncertainty in the model of the control parameters which give the control problem.\n(3.1.3) \nwhere  is the expected value of the measurement noise\n(3.1.4) \nwhere _\u03bc_ _K_ = the mean from the nutrient process after being updated with \n**E** ( **Q** ) + **E** ( **R** ) = mean of the nutrients process after the measurement was made with \u2208 _nK_\nis a matrix whose elements have the form\nwhere\nare the parameters which defines the nutrient process\nwhere **W** _T_ = [ _w_ 1 _T_ _w_ 2 _T_ ] _T_ with \n(3.1.5) \nwhere \n(3.1.6) \nwhere \n\n##### 3.1.1.2 NutrientOPT algorithm\nThe algorithm can be used to describe a control parameter uncertainty which has the shape of a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean and a variance. The goal in this algorithm is to estimate the uncertainty in the model, and use this estimate to find the uncertainty in the control parameters. If the parameters _u_ _P_ (the value of the control parameters) are found to be out of control the algorithm will suggest a change that should be made in the model.\nIn our application, the state of the control parameters is set at the initial condition and the state will be improved by changing the control parameters which describes the system. The algorithm searches for the unknown control parameter values _u_ 0. As long as control parameters are set equal to the initial value zero, the nutrient process will set up a new distribution of the measurement noise, which will give a new _x_ value. The algorithm will then use the new _x_ value to set up a new measurement noise. In the following a description of the algorithm and the procedure of the nutrient process will be given. \nStart with _t= 0_.\n1) A measurement is done where u0=0.\n_x =_ 0 _x_ and _u_ _0_ =0\n_E_ ( **R** ) = 1 _E_ ( **R** )\n_P_ ( _t_ _) = E_ ( **R** )T\nThe nutrient OPT model is used to set up a state and measurement noise.\n_Wp_ 0 _s = W_ 0 _s_\n_E_ ( **R** ) = [ _f_ _P_ 0 0]T\n_s =_ 0\n_p_ _0 =_ 0\n2) a new state is found:\nis called where _\u03b4_ is a new state,\n.\n3) _x_ 0 is found: is called where\n.\n4) New state found: is found \nWhere\nis called where _u_ 1 is found where\nis found where\nwhere\nwhere \nis called where (7) is used in\nis found where\n.\n5) is called where\nis found where\n**(2)\nis called where \nwhere\nwith \n\nFor (7) is found where is called where\n.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 1.1 Introduction Mechanical Vibration Engineering and science of Mechanical Vibrations deals with the excitation, detection and control of vibrations. Every mechanical system contains some degree of vibration and, to some extent, can be designed to vibrate. Vibration is the oscillatory motion of a particle about an equilibrium state. A force, as a function of time, produces an oscillation. The motion of the particle may be described by a mass-balance equation: m dv kx dx F = m(0) + 2 m(0) = dx = k x (1.1) where x is displacement, m is mass and k is stiffness. When such an equation can be exactly integrated, its solution can be described by the equation: \uf8eb m x dv \uf8f6 k = m t + A ei( t+ ) (1.2) 2 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 2 where A is an integration constant. This kind of equation can be integrated, but the solution is quite complex. When this equation was first proposed in 1669, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) concluded that a vibratory motion of a simple spring cannot be periodic. The equation m = 2k m is known as the undamped oscillation equation It has been shown that a spring mass system, at its natural frequency \u03c9n, cannot remain in a condition of harmonic vibration. If this system is excited in a manner that causes it to overshoot a point other than the equilibrium position and then return to that position, it is called in harmonic excitation since the spring and mass system is subjected to the same oscillatory force from the start. If there is no damping and the system is excited in this manner, its amplitude does not decrease to zero during vibration but remains a constant, called amplitude of oscillation, until the conditions of oscillation and excitation are no longer met; this constant is called the resonant amplitude. If the damping in a spring mass system is not too great, then vibration of the system is said to be free, but if damping is too great, then the vibration of the system ceases to be harmonic because resonance takes too great a time to occur. As the damping in the spring and mass system increases in such a way as to eventually stop the system from vibrating, oscillation becomes harmonic. When the degree of damping is large (1), the motion would be a combination of a number of modes and the system may become totally unstable. (a) The degree of damping is so small that the motion tends to be stable and the frequency and amplitude of oscillation tend not to vary significantly (i.e. it is a lightly damped system). (b) Damping is of intermediate (or medium) level (i.e. the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude tend to vary, but are not excessively affected when the motion of the system starts to occur). (c) Damping is large, causing the frequency and amplitude of oscillation to fluctuate to a large extent from 1 1 For more information, refer to L J. Goldsher, Mechanical Vibrations, McGraw-Hill 1982 Pp. 350-352 17 \n  19. 19\\.  those of the vibrating system as it starts out. This is an example of an unstable system and it may become even more unstable as the motion of the system continues. When the system can oscillate at all, the motion would be harmonic and if a harmonic motion is induced, oscillations at a single frequency exist. When the motion of a system is harmonic, the frequency of the motion is constant and the amplitude of the motion is a periodic function of time. Harmonic vibrations take the following form: x h = xm sin \u03b1t (1.3) \u03b1 is called \u2018angular frequency\u2019 and has units radians per second. The constant xm is the amplitude of oscillation and may be related to the maximum amplitude, A, as given in Eq.1.2. For the case of no damping and an unforced system, the maximum amplitude A is called the resonant amplitude or simply the amplitude at resonance. When a system is excited by the superposition (adding) of two or more harmonic vibrations having different frequencies, the result is sometimes called, in practice, compound motion for reasons which will become apparent later. It is often difficult to distinguish between damped motion and free motion when they behave so similarly, but one has to examine the form of the motion to distinguish free motion from damped one. Sometimes a small amount of motion can be sustained in a system when the system is at rest, or only when the excitation force is at a certain frequency and with a certain direction. This vibration persists for a long time and is called stationary vibration. It is often used in practice, to excite vibration of a rotor. Another type of vibration that has no special name is a vibration or a transient vibration which is the result of applying small force to a vibrating system when its equilibrium is disturbed from the point of view of its motion. For instance, the transient vibration would occur in a spring or an elastic solid when the initial displacement is not zero and is zero after the motion of the system reaches an equilibrium. Since damping is not present in the definition of transient vibration, the term transient vibration is a name to distinguish it from stationary vibration which may result in an actual stationary vibration when the equilibrium is disturbed. It is often found in technical literature that a term, \u2018Transient response\u2019 has been used to describe transient vibration. A vibration occurs whenever the equilibrium of a system is disturbed. A vibrating beam may be disturbed by a change in its support conditions, an applied force, or change in its temperature, to produce vibration (Fig. 1.1(a)). The motion is a result of force produced by gravity and the elasticity of the beam (1.4) The restoring force of the beam is also a sinusoidal function of time and the vibration of the beam will be a sinusoidal function as well. But the angular frequency 2 and the period T have different values depending on the type of excitation. The free vibration shown in Fig. 1.1(b) is called natural vibration (or simply, natural motion) which is a result of disturbance to the system from its equilibrium position at time zero (the initial displacement is zero). This type of vibration can be produced by a harmonic force only or by periodic forces which can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq.1.4. A vibrating mass system such as piston, a simple pendulum or torsional pendulum can also take excitation force, but only the case of the period of the forcing function and the period of the vibration of the system are equal to each other should be noticed. 18 \n  20. 20\\.  For the vibration of the mass, if the external force is a periodic function of t \u2013t with a period 2 2T , then the frequency of oscillation x and its period T are given by x dx 2 \u03c9 x = m = 2k = 0 2\u03c0 and T= = 2 \u03c0 x (1.5) k m If the force is a periodic function of t \u2013t with a period T, the frequency and the period of oscillation are 0 given by Eq.1.5. The case of motion occurs when the equilibrium position of the system is disturbed and the system can move around the disturbed equilibrium. The motion will continue indefinitely unless the system ceases to move because of damping or a harmonic force is applied during this motion. Because of the change in motion caused by disturbance, the type of motion is called transient motion. The motion during disturbance is not a type of steady state motion, because it has no period (i.e. it is transient motion). The steady state motion is a type of motion with a periodic function for each parameter. The motion of a system, which is disturbed by an arbitrary force, depends on the force that is a periodic function of time. 1.2 Classification of Vibration Generally speaking, mechanical vibration can be classified into two categories: (a) Harmonic vibration (b) Residual vibration Harmonic vibration consists of vibrations that have no damping and vibrations with a considerable amount of damping. Most engineering machinery and devices are subjected to harmonic vibrations. Residual vibration consists of vibration when the system is damped or the motion of the system ceases because of damping and excitation is a periodical function of time. The residual vibration is more common, but it is not of much practical importance for the following two reasons: (a) The type of residual vibration can be converted to a harmonic vibration at resonance or to a steady-state vibration by reducing the damping. (b) Almost all actual devices are unstable due to the existence of nonlinearities. If the device is slightly disturbed and allowed to execute the vibration mode, the system can easily become unstable and motion becomes non-periodic in time. 19 \n  21. 21\\.  1.3 Classification of Vibration Based on Damping A lightly damped vibration system is one in which the degree of damping (\u03b3) is so small that the motion tends to be stable and the frequency and amplitude of the vibration tend not to vary significantly. Its vibrations follow a sinusoidal curve and its solution can be expressed by \uf8eb x 2m dv \uf8f6 k = m t + A ei( t+ ) \u03b3 m = 1.6 m (1.7) \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 2 If there is considerable damping, the solution x depends on the damping ratio and has the form: ( ) \uf8f1 x = Ae i\u03c9 t + \u03b3 m = A 2 1 + (1.8) 2t \uf8eb 1 \uf8f6 \u03b3 m \uf8f4 \uf8f4 T = T0 \uf8ec1 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 0 \uf8f4 T T0 = \uf8f2 T1 < T0 < T2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 T = T0 \uf8ec1 \u2212 2 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8ed 3 \uf8f8 2i \uf8f4 T1 = T T0 \u2264 = \u2264 0 < T = T0 T1 < T2 \uf8f31 T0 T1 T2 T As can be seen from Eq.1.8, damping the vibration reduces the vibration amplitude by 2 m=1 and the period becomes greater than the natural period by 0 3 10% (for a resonance amplitude of 0.15). In fact the vibration amplitude will be a maximum when the damping ratio \u03b3 65% and a minimum when the damping ratio \u03b3 = 0.15. The period change is an example of transient or residual vibrations. The damping ratio depends on the system, is a constant value, and its value is usually fixed (i.e. there is no variation in the value of the damping ratio). 20 \n  22. 22\\.  When the degree of damping is large (\u03b3 > 0.65), the motion would be a combination of a number of modes and the system may become totally unstable. For the systems where the vibration type is stable (the lightly damped type as a rule) and the damping of the motion caused by the system is not great, the vibration is called harmonic vibration. The type of harmonic vibration can be excited when the system is subjected to harmonic force, i.e. the motion of the system is independent of the type of excitation. However, if the type of excitation is complex (other than simple harmonic), the condition is not satisfied because Eq.1.8 cannot be satisfied. From the definition of harmonic vibration, it can be stated that harmonic excitation is independent of excitation frequency and is limited to the natural vibration frequency of motion. As the excitation force on a vibrating system increases, the amplitude and period of vibration are changed accordingly. If the amplitude of excitation is a small value as compared with the critical value, the system does not become unstable and the amplitude of vibration will not be large. If the amplitude of excitation is of practical importance of the system, the type of excitation of the system becomes unstable. On the other hand, if the amplitude of harmonic excitation, i.e. the resonant amplitude of the system, is not large but is kept beyond a critical value, the type of excitation of the system still remains stable and the frequency or period of resonance of the system is not so important. When the type of excitation is of transient or residual vibrations, the critical amplitude which the type of excitation will become unstable because of the damping becomes the basis of determining whether the type of resonance will be unstable because of the damping. If the type of motion is a harmonic type (without damping), the damping ratio \u03b3 = 0 and the damping factor (1 + \u03b3 ) = 1.

The motion of the excited system is called an excitation type of motion because it is independent of the excitation type of the vibrating system. However, when the motion of the system is a transient oscillation, the system is unstable because the period of vibration is increased due to the resonance effect of system, but, since its period is the same as the natural period, the resonance can be avoided by reducing the system's amplitude of vibration in a limited condition. 21 \n  23. 23\\.  1.4 Classification of Vibration Based on the Excitation Type Vibrating systems can be classified into two categories: (a) Excited by single sinusoidal force. (b) Excited by a periodic force. A type of sinusoidal excitation (the excitation in which the form of the excitation function is a constant or a linear combination of a sinusoidal function) occurs due to random disturbance because the amplitude of the excitation is smaller than the critical value of the unstable vibration of harmonic motion. Thus the vibrating system remains in the \u2018stable condition\u2019. When the excitation amplitude exceeds the critical value of the unstable vibration, the type of excitation of the system undergoes a \u2018resonant vibration\u2019 at a natural cycle. As the excitation amplitude increases after the resonant value, the amplitude of vibration increases at each resonance. Therefore, there is no possibility of the type of excitation occurring in the natural cycle. Under such conditions the excitation becomes \u2018nonlinear\u2019 and the type of excitation is unstable and continues beyond the natural cycle. As the natural frequency in the excitation is not that which is subjected to the excitation, the type of excitation becomes periodic motion which is difficult to represent in the form of vibration. Since the natural cycle of vibration is stable in a harmonic form, the amplitude vibration remains in a stable condition for all values of amplitude vibration. If the excitation force that is harmonic is a periodical function of time, the excitation force can be expressed as: x = X (t ) = X (\u03c9 t + p ) = X e i\u03c9t = 2 2 m = X0 sin \u03c9t (1.11) X The natural vibration period of oscillation is given by 2\u03c0 X T= \u03c9 = \u03c0 2 (1.12) m Eq.1.12 means that the value of excitation depends on the type of excitation which causes the \u2018periodic type of vibration\u2019. When the excitation function is independent of the excitation function (x = x(t)), the excited system does not undergo any changes. Therefore the system is called a \u2018system independent of an excitation type\u2019. However, when the excitation function is a periodic function of type (Eq.1.11), the system undergoes resonant vibration, that is when the excitation period of the vibration and the period of vibration are equal. If the excitation period is equal to the vibration period, the excited system suffers transient oscillation (which causes sudden changes in the system) with resonance. Thus the periodic type of excitation of the type shown in Fig. 1.1(b) is called the \u2018system where excitation and vibration periods are equal (resonance)\u2019. The \u2018system where excitation and vibration periods (resonance) are equal\u2019 can be shown by Eqs.1.1 to 1.4 and Eqs.1.5 to 1.11. This system is called \u2018resonant system\u2019. If the excitation period is greater than the vibration period, the excited system suffers vibration with the transient period and transient amplitude, but does not undergo resonance. When the excitation causes periodic vibration, the excitation period is the 22 \n  24. 24\\.  resonant period of the excited system. Then the cycle period of the vibration is the same as the excitation cycle period. Hence, the system is called a resonant system \u2018under periodic excitation\u2019. The period of resonance in a periodic excitation system is not of great importance, because in a natural vibration the vibration period is the same as the natural vibration period 2 \u03c0. Since the vibration period is changed in general, the system under periodic excitation becomes unstable and the amplitude of vibration is a periodic function of time. The excitation force under periodic excitation is expressed by Eq.1.11. The value of the resonant amplitude can be given as follows: m x = X0i (1.11) = X X i 0 Therefore, using Eq.1.11, the resonant amplitude of a system where the excitation has periodic type can be written down by x = X 2m m \u03c0 (1 + \u03b3 ) 2 T= (1.13) 2 \u03c0= \u03c0 2 (1.13 can be obtained by using Eq.1.13, its value can be expressed using Eq.1.13. The equation can be written using eq.1.13. It can be written down using Eq.1.13. It can be used to simplify Eq.13. It is possible, using Eq.13. When the excitation period is different from the system vibration period, but the resonance occurs when the excitation period is the same as each other. The value of excitation can occur at one particular frequency, but the same as each other. The value of excitation period is the same as each other. \n  1.14 \n  2 \n  \n  \n  \nPage 10 the same, but the same as each.

In VictorianOPTbearing", "generated_output": " INM. \n11) Define the terms \"nominal\" and \"real.\" In terms of nominal and real GDP, how does the government and the Federal Reserve determine the target rate of inflation? Explain. In the context of the U.S. economy, how has the target rate of inflation changed between 2001 and 2020? Do prices increase at the same rate from one year to the next? Why or why not? Given this and economic, social, and political considerations, how would you argue for a lower target rate of inflation in any given year? \n12) Explain how, over time, population growth can affect the rate of inflation and how changes in monetary policy can affect population growth. Suppose the population is rising at constant rate of 1 percent per year. Can GDP growth exceed one percent per year? Explain your answer. Suppose you live in an economy with a constant population. Explain how an expansionary (i.e., stimulatory) monetary policy, including large-scale government stimulus spending and reduced interest rates, can help to reduce the rate of inflation. You may assume that this will help to raise real GDP, the nominal GDP, the employment level, and the price level. \n13) You have heard or read that the Federal Reserve wants inflation to be 2 percent per year, but the government does not. (The government does not set the target rate of inflation at all. Instead it simply targets the inflation rate at between 1 and 3 percent so as to prevent the inflation rate from getting out of control.) Explain what you would like to accomplish as you understand this goal of 2 percent per year. Would 2 percent per year be considered too low or too high? \n14) Suppose the Federal Reserve's policy objective is that the economy grows at a steady pace of 2.5 percent per year. (The economy need not always be at that level\u2014it can change in response to events, but it generally adjusts to return to its steady growth rate). Explain how this policy has the effect of bringing about the central bank's goal of steady growth over the long term. Using the data in 2015, calculate the real GDP growth from 2014 to 2015, the inflation between 2014 and 2015, the rate of real GDP growth (real GDP growth from one year to the next) between 2014 and 2015. Did this policy work and meet its goal in reaching steady growth over the long term? Explain why or why not? \n15) The Federal Reserve recently introduced a significant easing in policy, in response to the COVID-19 effect and the consequent slowdown in the economy. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the Fed funds rate to between 0\u20130.25 percent. Use the data on nominal GDP and CPI from 2018, 2019, 2020 at the same period in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and determine the inflation rate at each one of these dates, and the growth of the nominal GDP (real GDP growth from one year to the next). Are such measures of the rate of growth of the economy helpful in determining the level of the economy? Is the policy goal of 2 percent rate of inflation too low? \n16) What are the advantages of an inflationary economy? Give one example. What are the disadvantages? Give one example. What are real GDP and the price level, and why are they different? Discuss the link between the quantity of money in an economy and the price level. Can you think of any examples of economies where monetary policy had the wrong effect and the economy ended up in an inflationary cycle? Can you think of any examples of economies where monetary policy had the wrong effect and the economy ended up in a recession? Why does an expansionary monetary policy not lead to a steady increase in the price level over long periods of time? (Consider the effects on the demand for goods and the velocity of money.) What is inflation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of high rates of inflation? What does \u201ctarget 2 percent\u201d mean?

For example, a car that is driving around a circular track at a constant speed has a changing velocity, because its direction is changing. What is the formula for speed and the formula for velocity?", "prompt": "In nutrientOPTAlf", "combined_input": "Speed is the measure of how fast an object is moving, while velocity is the measure of how fast an object is moving in a specific direction. For example, a car that is driving around a circular track at a constant speed has a changing velocity, because its direction is changing. What is the formula for speed and the formula for velocity? In nutrientOPTAlf", "generated_output": "alfa-based cow and feedlot rations. Average speed is often used in rate math problems. The equation to find the average speed of an object:\n    A person driving a car  along a straight highway frequently uses the speed limit sign to make sure they are driving within the speed limit:\n\n##### **What is the difference between velocity and speed formula?**\nSpeed is the scalar quantity that shows the distance covered by a unit of time whereas velocity is the vector quantity shows the distance traveled in the given time and direction of the motion.\n\n#### **What is the formula for speed in physics?**\nCalculating speed from distance and time\nSo, if a distance x meters is covered within the time t seconds, the speed in m/s is **v=x/t**. Note that in these calculations, the time is in seconds, the distance in meters and the speed is in m/s, also known as \"meters per second\".\n\n#####  **What is the velocity equation?**\nThe equation that relates the velocity and acceleration vectors for a constant or uniform acceleration is defined as velocity = acceleration time: v = at. This is an often used physics equation so make sure you are able to rearrange it to solve for any of the variables.\n\n####  **How do I calculate velocity and speed?**\nAs distance and time are scalar quantities, the product of them always yields another scalar, the speed. And so, in this formula\n    **Speed = distance/time**\nspeed = 4 / 2 = 2 m/sec. As speed is the scalar quantity, and yet the change in the velocity of an object is equal to the vector quantity acceleration.\n\n####  **What is the speed of an object?**\nspeed is the measure of how fast an object is moving. speed is the scalar product of distance and time. speed is measured in meters/second (meters/sec.) velocity is the measure of how fast an object is moving in a specific direction. velocity is the vector product of distance and time.\n\n####  **What is the average speed?**\nAverage Speed. This is the average distance covered per time unit. In other words, it is a measure of 'distance travelled per unit time'. For example, 40 km in 2 hours, 20 km in 1 hour, etc. Average speed is used to define the speed at a certain point during an expedition.\n\n####  **What is the velocity of an object?**\nVelocity is the rate of change of the body's position with respect to a frame of reference and is a function of time. It is a vector quantity, both in S.I. units and the cgs system having both magnitude and direction. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) is called speed.\n\n#####  **How do I calculate average speed?**\naverage speed = Total distance/Total time.  \nSo you have total distance of 6.5 miles and total time of 4.25 hours.  \n6.5 miles/4.25 hours = 1.53 mph.\n\n####  **What is the average speed of a car?**\nAverage speed is a measure of the rate of motion, or how quickly something is moving, and while the speed is the rate of motion the rate includes the direction. On average, a car travels at a speed of 33.1 m s\u20131 which in our examples translates to 79.3 mph and 103.5 km/h.\n\n####  **What is the difference between average speed and velocity?**\n**Speed is just a scalar quantity and velocity** is a vector quantity that has both both magnitude and direction.\n\n####  **What is the formula for average speed physics?**\nAnswer: **d/t**. Explanation: \"Average\" means that it involves the average value of the result.\n\n#####  **How do you calculate velocity and speed from a graph?**\n**Speed can be measured from a distance-time graph** : the slope of a distance-time graph is the speed. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. If a distance-time graph is a straight line which slopes up to the right, then the speeds are constant.\n\n####  **What is the unit of speed in physics?**\ndistance/time\n\n####  **How long is 70 mph in seconds?**\nAt 28.9 meters per second (70 mph), the time to stop was 7.5 seconds, and at 14.5 meters per second (31 mph), it was 17 seconds.\n\n####  **What is the unit of speed in physics class 11?**\nThe unit of speed is **meter per second (m/s)**. SI unit of speed is m/s.\n\n####  **How long does it take to accelerate to 70 mph?**\nIt takes approximately 7.0 seconds to reach a top speed of over 70.0 mph (112 km/h). When braking at the same rate, it takes a bit longer (about 8.52 seconds) and the car comes to a stop at a speed of 33.7 mph (54.3 km/h).\n\n####  **Which of the following is an average speed of the car?**\nThe correct answer is option D) is the speed of 50.72 km/h.\n\n####  **What is the difference between velocity and speed in a physics class?**\n**Speed is a scalar, velocity is a vector.**\n\n####  **What is the difference between average speed and instantaneous speed?**\n**Instantaneous speed is the speed of an object at a particular time, while average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time to get there**. Instantaneous speed will be higher because a car accelerating has been traveling for some time before you take the speed reading.\n\n####  **Is speed a vector or a scalar quantity?**\n**Speed is a scalar quantity while velocity is a vector quantity** and its direction is from point A to point B. When velocity is mentioned it is always in reference of magnitude/speed and direction.\n\n####  **What is the speed of a bullet fired from a rifle?**\nThe bullet has a muzzle velocity of about **1,100 feet per second** , much faster than a muzzle velocity of about 800 feet per second common from a rifle, handgun, or shotgun.\n\n####  **What is the average speed of a bullet fired from a gun?**\nThe muzzle-velocity of a bullet that has been taken from a cartridge is somewhere average in the region of about 1000 feet-per-second, or about **333 meters per second** , although this average value may be a little different from gun to gun, and the data may not be totally reliable.\n\n####  **How long does it take for a bullet from a gun to make contact with its point of impact?**\nAt 300 m, a bullet will take **.** a bullet has a muzzle velocity of 1024 m/s, the impact time will be: 512m / 1024m/s = 0.5s Therefore, this means the bullet take 0.5s to make the impact on the target.\n\n####  **How do you know if a bullet is moving?**\nIf an object is not moving, we say it is in its stationary state. If an object is moving, then we cannot say that it has no speed. If an object is moving, that means it has some speed. If we talk about this in terms of magnitude of speed and its direction, then we say that an object is in motion.\n\n####  **How do you measure speed?**\nThere are three main units used to measure speed, **meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour**. Meters per second are used mostly to measure speed in long races like marathons. Kilometers per hour and miles per hour, are mainly used to measure average speeds of a journey.\n\n####  **Does a bullet have a speed?**\nWe say the bullet has speed equal to its momentum divided by its mass. \u2026 **The speed of a bullet that has been taken straight from the gun is about 200 meters per second**.\n\n####  **Does muzzle velocity increase with bullet weight?**\n**Muzzle velocity tends to decrease as bullet weight increases and vice-versa**.\n\n####  **How fast is bullet muzzle velocity?**\nFrom a muzzle velocity of 2,300 fps to a muzzle velocity of 7,020 fps, a bullet's terminal velocity will generally be between **250 fps** and 1,900 fps.", "num_tokens_generated": 1893, "OGF": 0.462158203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 43.24660134315491, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 245, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The unit of force in the SI system is a newton. force calculator. Force is a push or pull indicated by a motion that causes an object to change speed or direction or both. Calculate your weight on other planets in our solar system or on other planets or moons of other solar systems! Use the calculator below to calculate your weight on other planets. Weight Converter. Calculate it here with our BMI calculator. We define weight as a measure of the amount of matter. The calculation of the force exerted is based on both the height and gravitational acceleration. There are 9.8 newtons of force applied on the body that gives an acceleration of 158 centimeter per second square. The weight formula of a body varies on the object, its mass and the gravitational force that is acting upon it. Mass and force mass is a measure of how much matter (of a substance or an object) is, while force measures the strength of these forces. As a result, it will increase weight if a person moves from a low-gravity environment such as on the Earth to a high-gravity. Weight Formula \u2013 How to Calculate Weight. We know that, Force = Mass \u00d7 Acceleration. You know how to calculate weight of object by using density mass volume calculator, but what happens when you get confused by newtons and kilograms? It expresses the ratio of mass of the object to the acceleration produced on it by the Earth. (m 3) = (L) 3; Therefore, the formula used for area to volume conversion for a solid object is; V (Volume) = A (Area) \u00d7 L (Length). You must be logged in to \u2026 So I have a 50 pound carton, 5 pounds, but I wanted to be able to calculate the force of gravity on it so I could calculate the maximum amount of force I could exert if I were able to get the carton high above the ground. Here's how to compute the acceleration due to gravity for a specific body, given the mass and radius of that body. 6 N. The second formula is used when an alternate force is applied through a distance. I'm not sure if the force of gravity between 2 objects will always remain constant or if the strength of gravity will decrease as the objects distance increases. Calculate the acceleration of the object. It is denoted by A and is expressed as m/s2 or m/s/s or m/sec2. The formula used to calculate weight includes a normal force which is the force exerted by a surface on an. To find force, use this relationship: F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. The basic unit of weight. Mass and Density are inversely proportional to each other. Your body mass is 62kg. \u2026 It's equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time. Weight is the gravitational force acting on a force - measured in Newton's (N) - which equals mass x acceleration due to gravity. Use this easy and mobile-friendly calculator to convert between grams per milliliter and molarity. A \u2018Kilogram\u2019 is a unit of mass. Calculate the weight of an object. Force = mass x weight. 3 N. The third formula is when two equal but opposite forces are acting on an object at rest. The force F required to accelerate an object of mass m at an. To find acceleration, divide the force by the mass; a = F / m. This will give you the acceleration, in meters per second squared. Calculate the force due to gravity or weight of a body in the space based on the mass and weight of an object. Acceleration due to gravity The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is the same for all objects. Example: A force of 10.0 N is required to move a body from point A to point B at a steady speed. How to calculate force force = mass x acceleration. The weight is the amount of force exerted on a body by the gravitation of a object when placed on it. Calculate your weight on other planets in our solar system or on other planets or moons of other. For example, if a person has a mass of 80 kilograms, a weight of 80 Newtons will be acted upon. An object will be accelerated in the direction of the force that acts on it, along with increasing speed up to the point that its weight reaches the support or the weight of support. Note: The formula above assumes that the angle, \u03c6, is small and, therefore, sin(\u03c6) \u2248 tan(\u03c6) = x/L where x is the distance over which the mass moves and L is the length of the incline. In fact, the. Calculate the acceleration due to force of gravity in terms of the acceleration a of a spring that is extended an amount equal to the distance that you are from the surface of the earth. The amount of force required to set into motion a body is known as its inertia. 100 kg, the formula is = W kg \u00d7 g m/s 2. In general, the weight of any object is dependent on its mass. To calculate the area, you just need to enter a positive numeric value in any of the 3 fields of the calculator. The weight of the body is the amount of force by which it attains a downward acceleration towards the Earth. The basic principle is that force = mass \u00d7 acceleration(F = ma). As the object goes up the slope, the mass in Newton\u2019s Second Law would equal (mass of the stone)(gravitational acceleration) (sin(a)) as an acceleration to the object. As a result if we want to know the weight, we need to know the mass. So I have a 50 pound carton, 5 pounds, but I wanted to be able to calculate the force of gravity on it so I could calculate the maximum amount of force I could exert if I were able to get the carton high above the ground. How to calculate weight in grams per milliliter (g/mL). Where, W is the weight (N) F is the force (N) m is the mass (kg) M is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s 2) A simple force calculator using Newton\u2019s second law. The formula for the work W required to move an object from point A to point B is: The work done is defined as: W = Fdcos (\u03c6) where F is the force acting on the object, d is the distance traveled by the object and \u03a6 is the angle between the F and d vectors (in this example it\u2019s zero since the force is acting along the x-axis) Therefore, a 50 kg body would weigh 490N (on Earth\u2019s surface). The acceleration due to gravity near the Earth can be estimated by assuming it is caused solely by the mass of the Earth. How to Calculate the Work of a Force? The work in the formula is in joules, which is the same unit of measurement as the product of the force times distance. The weight of an object is related to acceleration. The relationship between the amount of work done by a force depends on the angle of inclination \u03c6 of the force vector as seen in the following figure: Force calculator. Calculate weight using the actual surface gravity of an object. Mass is a measure of inertia. The formula for the acceleration of a falling object from Earth\u2019s surface: a = g \u2013 g m/L. The mass does not change, but the surface of the Earth's force of gravity can change because the Earth's mass and gravitational field strength (gravitational acceleration) can change at different points on the planet Earth. where W is the weight (N) F is the force (N) m is the mass (kg) M is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s 2) A simple gravity formula for weight is: Weight = Mass x Gravity. Calculate the acceleration of the object. This calculator can be used as weight calculator or gravitational force calculator. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change in the velocity of the body. F = ma = 50. If two objects are interacting with one another, the force of gravity acting on them would be the same. Mass: Its value is determined by the amount of space within an object. This calculator uses Newton's method to solve a system of 2 or 3 non-linear equations with two or three unknowns. Use this online force calculator to calculate the force based on the mass and gravity values. By using this website, you agree to our Cookie Policy. To calculate the force acting on a body, the formula is F = (mass)(gravity). F \u2013 force measured in newtons (N) m \u2013 mass measured in kilograms (kg) a \u2013 acceleration measured in meters per second squared (m/s 2 ) Weight and mass are related but not interchangeable. If we had instead 5 N of force acting up the plane, then there would be, on the same object, a lesser acceleration, but the same result. For example, an object with 50 kg is at the Earth's surface weighs 490N. Your body mass is 112.56 kg. The weight formula in physics is given as. weight or force of an object is the product of its mass and gravitational acceleration (the mass times the acceleration due to the planet\u2019s gravity), i.e. However, in fact, an object\u2019s mass is its weight per the gravitational force of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. Acceleration has a value of 10 m/s 2. Calculates the force needed to hold a body at rest by gravity, the weight force. However, an object's mass is the same measure, regardless of location or gravitational influence. The SI unit of force is the newton, symbolized N. The formula to calculate the force is: F = m*a. An object in free fall accelerates downwards under the influence of gravity only. Mass and density are not the same. Calculate the force needed to move an object. To calculate the weight of any object in the universe, simply multiply the mass of that object by the universal gravitational constant 6.672 E-11 ! The formula for calculating the force, measured in Newtons (N), applied when gravity accelerates an object that has mass m, measured in kilograms (kg), at an acceleration of a, measured in meters per second squared (ms^-2), is: F = ma. \u2022 Calculate the force of gravity at different heights of Earth The formula you use is: w = mg. This formula says that to work out the weight, multiply the mass of the object by the gravitational field strength. The weight-to-power ratio (W/P) of a car depends on how much it weighs, as well as how much power it produces. Calculate the average net force F ave (on top of the hill). In terms of weight, the formula is: W = (m) (g). Calculate the acceleration of the object. To calculate the area, you just need to enter a positive numeric value in any of the 3 fields of the calculator. It is equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time. An object will be continuously accelerated towards the Earth as its position moves towards and away from the Earth's surface. \u2022 The acceleration of gravity due to the combined masses of Earth and Moon = g Earth + g Moon. For example, if you know the force is 10 Newtons and the mass is 5 kilograms, simply multiply them together to find the weight of the object. What is the acceleration of gravity near the centre of the moon where the gravitational field strength is 1.63 N/kg ? Here is a list of online calculators that will help you with calculations for weight, mass, density, volume or force. Here, g = gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s 2 (approx) where the value of g can vary depending on the location or gravity (more precisely, the \"standard acceleration due to gravity\", which is different from the \"average acceleration due to gravity\"). An object will not be accelerated if either there is no force acting on it, or the force is equal to the weight of the object. Gravity on the moon is only 17 percent \u2026 To calculate the force, use the formula. F = ma. The following formula is used to calculate the force of gravity of an object. It is measured in N/m\u00b2. You can calculate the gravitational force using the following formula: For example, if an object has the mass of 100 kilograms and there is 10 Newtons force acting on it, then its weight is 1000N. Gravity is a fundamental phenomenon of nature, its origins in the structure of space-time and the particles that make up the universe have been a source of interest to physicists for more than a century. Newton's Second Law of Motion states that F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. In simple words, a car\u2019s weight depends on how much something weighs. The weight, force of gravity on a body, is measured in newton. But here m and a stand for the values of the mass and acceleration, of the object. The SI system unit of the force is Newton (N). Force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration; that\u2019s to say the force \u2026 The first is the net force on the object moving along the incline. It means the force is inversely proportional to the surface area of the body and therefore, the greater the surface area, the less the gravitational force. The weight is how much the earth pulls downward on an object. The unit of Newton is the derived unit for force. Note: The formula above assumes that the angle, \u03c6, is small and, therefore, sin(\u03c6) \u2248 tan(\u03c6) = x/L where x is the distance over which the mass moves and L is the length of the incline. As a result, it will decrease weight as the planet moves away from the Sun. where F is a force. However, if you don\u2019t want to have to memorize the mass numbers for these elements, you can always go back to the periodic table and look at the mass number. How to Calculate Force. (ii) 10g of a substance weighs 8g on the moon. The work done by gravity is mgh. The formula in Newton\u2019s Second Law for the acceleration of an object is F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Force is a push or pull that makes an object accelerate. Weight 1. The weight formula of a body varies on the object, its mass and the gravitational force that is acting upon it. A body\u2019s weight (W) depends only on its mass (m) and the local gravity (g). Weight = mass x gravity. Formula: force = mass x acceleration F = m a. In general, the weight of any object is. If you need to, you can re-arrange the force formula for mass. Note: Enter the desired mass/weight value in the blank text field. Example: A carton with an object weighing 60kg on the Earth surface will weigh 59 N on Mars surface. How to Calculate Force? Calculate the weight. We have also simplified as you have provided the formula of the object of mass of the earth. Weight is a measure of mass, how much matter it is. Calculating force from acceleration is accomplished with little more than rearranging the basic formula for Newton's second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration. We can say that weight varies inversely with the gravitational pull. What is the average net force F ave in the first figure? The amount of body\u2019s weight on the Earth depends on the object\u2019s mass and the force by which it attains a downward acceleration towards the Earth. The force required to set something into motion is called the force of inertia. F = ma = 20 N. Another way to calculate the force is using weight as the primary factor in the formula: If we have a 10 kg object, the weight will be 98.1 N. If we have a 10 N force acting on it, the acceleration will be 0.981 m/s2. Now let us consider the situation where we have to calculate the force due to gravity of an object. If you do not know what it is and wish to calculate from the weight on a specific planet to calculate the mass of an unknown object, continue reading to the bottom of this page. Gravity or weight is the measure of the strength of a gravitational field for an object at a given location. How long will it take that object to hit the surface of the planet if it is shot upward with a velocity of 5 kg. In Newtonian physics, mass is an intrinsic property of an object, and cannot be transferred or changed. 6.23 \u00d7 10 23. How to Calculate the Weight - Formula & How to Find? By using this website, you agree to our Cookie Policy. Calculate the acceleration. If F net = 50.5 N and m = 10.0 kg, then Newton's Second Law gives us a second formula to calculate the mass: W = mg. This formula says that to work out the weight, multiply the mass of the object by the gravitational field strength. Weight is the force weight of your body, in newtons (N). F = m a = 15 m/s 2. In other words, there is an acceleration of the object towards the center of the earth. Using the formula for force, it could be expressed as: Where \"m\" is the mass, and \"g\" is the local acceleration due to gravity. Use the formula: F=m * a. where F= force, m= mass, a= acceleration It would require a more precise understanding of the planets than \u2026 How to Calculate the Weight of the Object. You will get the force in pounds. It is denoted by F. F = ma Where, m is the mass of the object F = The force applied g = acceleration due to gravity of the object The weight formula in physics is given as. Force is measured in newtons (N). In simple words, when a body is being moved by a force, but there is no change in the body\u2019s position then this is termed as equilibrium. When using a Newton meter, you are using kilogram*meters per second squared. \u2026 The force of gravity varies with your location on Earth. It's going to be a vector. So basically, mass is a measure of how much matter makes up an object. \n**calculate the force formula 2021**", "num_tokens_generated": 3998, "OGF": 0.97607421875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 97.58372211456299, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 248, "chunk_index": 5, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
