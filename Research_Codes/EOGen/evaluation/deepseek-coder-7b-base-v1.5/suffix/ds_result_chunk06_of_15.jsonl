Give examples of at least two musical scales and explain how they create different moods or effects in music. Describe the different scales and harmonies that are used in traditional blues and rock and roll music. Describe the music of a cappella vocal groups using a variety of scales. In addition to the melodic intervals described in Part 2 (b), describe other melodic intervals you can hear, like leaps, glissandi, slurs, trills. Musical scales and harmonic modes are at the basis of western music, the major scale being the primary one (A=440 Hz or A440) and it has had a massive impact on classical, contemporary and popular music. All western music is based on a scale that derives from that one. This scale is essentially a scale of 7 notes played in ascending order followed by descending order. To determine if a song is based on a certain key, there are a series of steps which are followed and which will be demonstrated in this assignment through the example songs of Jimi Hendrix\u2019 \u201cRed House\u201d and \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d (Bob Dylan). When using the \u201cRed House\u201d example and the \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d example, we need a little bit of background knowledge before proceeding to the analysis so to help you grasp the concepts, we need to understand and analyse the basics of harmonic analysis, pitch hierarchy, and how that is applied to music. This will be covered in Parts 2 and 3 of the assignment (b) to (d). [pic] Step 1: To analyse the notes of each song, we need to determine all of the notes, this can be by reading or with the help of a piano keyboard. For example, the first 10 notes of \u201cRed House\u201d are as follows: D3 E3 F#3 G3 A3 B3 C#4 D4 E4 F#4 Step 2: Next, you need to figure out the root note of the scale\u2026 \n2180 words - 9 pages\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC TO OUR DAILY LIVES Essay\nIn 500 b.c., Pythagoras wrote a treatise about the sound quality of a trumpet which went on to develop the idea of musical tuning as well as the method of the scientific study of music. Pythagoras is best known as the first man to have tried to formulate a theory using physics. He said that if we want to know the purity of a sound, then we multiply sound by its opposite which has the same pitch. That is what I have learnt. I think that Pythagoras is a very important man in the history of science. The importance of this man is the way he thinks and applies music theory that he created into practice. This shows how the idea that was originally conceived in ancient Greece has taken up root and developed into the discipline of music theory. What I found most surprising about Pythagoras was that he created his own musical theory and applied it successfully. He used physics to study sound. He used the vibration to create pure sounds. He came up with the ideas of musical tuning by using a triangle that he called as the pentatonic scale. He also had the law of the \u201cwhole, whole, half\u201d that has been used in composition to describe musical intervals and is the principle of the musical tuning. In addition to Pythagoras\u2019 invention that was the precursor of music theory, the man also has another musical theory which is the musical temperament. This musical theory is based on the way in which the frequencies that are related to each other. The musical temperament that Pythagoras came up with was a way to determine the way the different instruments produce the... \n2123 words - 9 pages\nL\u2019ART DE L\u2019AUDIENCE- EVALUATION MUSICALE 2014-2015/ Evaluation Musicale 2014-2015\nL'art de l'audition 1\\. 2\\. 3\\. 4\\. 5\\. 6\\. 7\\.

I\u2019m so proud of you and it was so awesome to see you again in LA this week \u2013 I\u2019m so blessed to know YOU!\nYou have been an inspiration my whole life!\nLove you!\nThis totally made me cry (so great to see that picture)! I had the same fear when going to the doctors to discuss using a Depo shot so I feel for you & am so thankful you finally gave them the information you had about it!\nLove this post so much! You have a great attitude about it. I would love nothing more than to not have to worry about a period any more.\nYour post brought me to tears! I can\u2019t wait for the day I can get rid of my period. It\u2019s a constant reminder of just how long I\u2019ve been out of college. *insert happy tears here*\nI had such faith in Dr. Weese that I agreed to fill my prescription for Nexplanon. I know you\u2019ve seen this story before, but I hope you can help all the other women who are considering going on this and are afraid. I had an ultrasound and a consultation, he didn\u2019t even say what the actual procedure was like. He just said that this is one of the better methods for removing the ovarian tissue. But he assured me that he wouldn\u2019t get into it too many details because it\u2019s a medical procedure. After he assured me that it is very painless, I decided to go for it. I was very hesitant (even after you talked to me about Nexplanon), but I knew that the pain of having to take the pill daily was much worse than the pain I would feel after my ovaries would be removed. At the ultrasound, Dr. Weese told me that he had taken in many requests for this procedure and that he actually likes that everyone is so comfortable. He doesn\u2019t really give a lot of details in his office, so it\u2019s nice that women understand it and that he takes the time to prepare them. My surgery was Thursday and I will be 31 Friday! Thanks again!\nWhen I was asked a few months ago about wanting a \u201cpregnancy free\u201d marriage, I just thought it was kind of dumb.\nBut now that my husband and I are thinking about kids at age 34, it makes perfect sense!\nWhat a good reminder for this woman with the cancer. Thank God for men that love their wives, and for the wives that don\u2019t get caught up in the fear of all natural things and don\u2019t give up your own freedom and power for the good of the man that loves you. God has blessed, the wife that does not worry.\nLove you, my friend\nThank you for sharing this! Thank you for sharing your story. I have been struggling with the cycle questions as well. I went to my doctor about a month ago to ask the same thing and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking questions you shouldn\u2019t be!\u201d I wish there was something to give up. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m so happy you have a book though.\nHi Kari,\nJust wanted to reach out. I understand going to my doc and having them tell me they will do something that you want but don\u2019t know if you can trust them and how they will do it. This past year I was having symptoms of pervious preganancy and I didn\u2019t know if it was the ovaries or I was depressed or if it was cancer. I had a couple of tests done for pregnancy and they came back negative. I found out after they did the tests that I had cancer. It was difficult to accept as I was expecting a lot and my husband loved children. I had been trying for some time and I wanted so badly to be able to have them and that\u2019s where we are. When I got the cancer I was so concerned about it spreading. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t have the fear anymore and I have my health back. You can have whatever you want and as long as you make sure you take good care of your body it will do what you want with it. What does cancer have to do with fertility! All I\u2019m saying is that you have to trust you doctor. I\u2019ve seen that too much in our family. I\u2019m blessed to be healthy and able to have a healthy relationship with my children. Blessings!\nHi Kari!\nThanks so much for posting about your book. It has brought tears to my eyes a few times already. It\u2019s so encouraging to read through the stories in your book.\nDo you have a Facebook Group that\u2019s dedicated to your book? I would love to join it! I\u2019ll be sharing your Facebook page link with my friends, so they\u2019ll get it right away!\nLove you!\nThank you Kari. I am going to your event today and hope you do a book signing. As soon as I was reading your story, I could see the similarities in my own. I too am scared of not being able to get pregnant after my ovaries are removed. I have been trying for 3+ years and I have not started trying again. One of my worst fears. Thank you for being open, honest and sharing your story. Bless you for making the best of some of the most challenging things life can offer. xox\nI loved your article! I\u2019ve been thinking similar things lately and am thankful to live in a country where a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body.\nI have my tubes tied next week and I\u2019m so excited! (Also thankful it\u2019s a little less than 2 weeks before my period.)\nAnd this is so helpful-I don\u2019t know where I would find the info on how to do it myself or the possible risks and benefits.\nThis is a wonderful article. As a woman in a country that does not give women the right to choose, I am thankful for my country, culture, and society that is so thankful that they have these choices. This is very encouraging!\nI was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 4 years ago. But I had already had treatment for my fallopian tubes (which was recommended before my actual diagnosis).\nSo my fallopian tubes have been gone for a long, long time!\nThankfully I\u2019m in remission right now, and not worried about my future fertility either!\nThis is great Kari! I was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer and I had fallopian tubes when the doctors told me they had removed them for me. I am so encouraged by your story and just want to say I am thankful you had your tubes removed and that you know where they\u2019ve been! I wish you much courage in this next transition.\nI\u2019ve been told the same. I had my tubes removed when I was 28 because I had an abnormal fallopian tube ultrasound with an enlarged salivary gland and my onco- surgeon was concerned about that. The doctor did not tell me that he had removed both tubes for me, and I assumed it was something else. That was 3 years ago. I was trying for my first child and was told by friends that I should get the tubes tied if I didn\u2019t feel like I was getting pregnant. The doctor told me I could get pregnant with 1 tube but not the other so that I should try and don\u2019t get it tied. So I started trying and when I didn\u2019t get pregnant I did an ultrasound for reasons other than my tubes, and he told me at the time I should get it tied. So that\u2019s what I did. When I was in the hospital and they removed my tubes, I had no idea they had already been removed for me. I actually thought my tubes had been removed for health reasons, which is why the ovarian cancer came to be.\nI had my tubes removed at 34\u2026. I was afraid to get pregnant again after my hysto! I\u2019m so happy your are going to be okay!\nThis is so encouraging to read. I had my tubes and ovaries removed for another diagnosis last August. I\u2019m currently in a 2 and a half year long journey with remission, but I still face fear of the future. I\u2019m glad that I had a choice so that I could have this conversation with myself and in turn my amazing husband as well.\nI still have feelings of sadness that I am losing the ability to have children, but know that my children are already blessed to have a mother that is both whole and alive. I\u2019m also thankful that I had a choice to be proactive as opposed to reactive to my situation, which allowed me to be more clear at the time of my diagnosis and treatment.\nThank you for sharing your story.\nI had the same conversation w/ my doctor: \u201cshould I go ahead and have my tubes tied?,\u2019 to which she responded with, \u2018Well, yes, if you want to\u2019. I went ahead and did it then, not expecting to have to go back and ask again, or for it to be taken away. I don\u2019t want to lose it either, but I\u2019ve been told (not all by the same doctor) that it is possible to lose pregnancies and if not, I\u2019m not \u201cwasting\u201d it\u2026 but I don\u2019t feel that way. I would love to be pregnant, but not if it comes at the expense of my health. So, while I am excited to be able to tell my children, \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d if I\u2019m cancer-free, I am also saddened at the thought of not being able to have a child on my own and would love to use fertility treatments that have worked for other women like me\u2026. if they exist. It will still be a challenge to convince my doc I would like them to be on record in my medical record, but if I can get them to sign a non-disclosure/ non-interference form, I can request my insurance pay for the treatments. I do know that it\u2019s possible to reverse the effects of ovarian cancer (or to remove tumors before they get to large and to prevent the need to remove the tissue) and there are companies like the Center for Reproductive Health that do hope to develop treatments for women with cancer. I am praying for all women diagnosed even in the early stages in a timely manner, as I truly believe this cancer is being diagnosed before it needs to be because of women having early access to testing. I am not angry that more isn\u2019t known about it and what the long-term effects are, but sad, since it has been that knowledge that has put so many in a position to lose their lives to this disease over the past 3 years. If any changes are made and the tests are more widely available, I wonder if the treatments will be too, including for cancerous ovary tissue or \u201cwomb\u201d treatments. We can\u2019t afford to lose anymore women to cancer from lack of information. So many stories exist that show these treatments CAN help (or has helped) those who have needed them so badly and should be considered even if they do not cure, as they may prevent the need for removal of the tissue.\nIf I can do it, you can do it. I am so glad you have your book out, have peace and comfort in all of this pain.\nI had my fallopian tubes removed because of a hysterosalpingogram and my ovaries removed 3 years ago. Since then I am completely off all birth control and I have felt a definite peace. I am 45. My husband is very supportive. I have had no real troubles finding out I\u2019m pregnant and since last year with a high school reunion we\u2019ve had friends get married. There\u2019s always been the concern that I could have had a stroke, but since I take no birth control and get my blood work up to date I really haven\u2019t worried. I have been told that if I\u2019m not worried they probably shouldn\u2019t give a big thump up in the back. I am so glad you\u2019ll be okay if all goes well. Keep that glass of water on hand for those nervous moments.\nI had a hysterosalpingogram and my tubes were taken out in april 2014. At 36 and after five miscarriages, I was hoping desperately for the miracle that was waiting to happen, but I didn\u2019t know that it could all be taken away for good. I was so close\u2026 my periods were getting lighter and I was getting really excited, then my doctor (who was supposed to take my tubes out the day after the procedure!) told me the following morning that he would get them out on a follow up visit on May 20. But when I got home, I felt really good for the first time in a while\u2026 so I called my husband to tell him that I thought it was just a fluke, and that things were going really well. So a few days later, I am starting to get my period, and I get a call from my husband,\u201dwhat time did your appointment with the nurse that did the operation to take out your tubes at school.\u201d I am terrified as to what my answer will be! I call\u2026 I get a voicemail of the nurse who did my procedure and the message goes that I have a 30 minute follow up with Dr D\u2026. I start sobbing on the phone crying like a baby. So I call my husband again and I just tell him in tears that the nurse is saying that something may be wrong\u2026 I can\u2019t believe how much courage it takes for you to say \u201cI don\u2019t want them cut out because the baby will be gone.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you what a relief it was. I am 27 days late and the little girl that we\u2019ve prayed for and dreamed about and hoped for so much is a girl. It was one of the proudest moments of my life, when they told me she is a girl! I am so thankful God put her in my arms and in my heart, and I only hope He will heal my tubes and restore my health so that I will once again have the miracle of pregnancy. It will be wonderful when I can tell my children that there were no tubes in my body for over a year! God bless you for sharing your heart and your story. We need to hear the voices of others that don\u2019t look just like us and have been through the same kinds of things.\nHi Kari! I have had my tubes tied and it feels like a dream! I am so thankful to have it out of my body and feel so much better after that! I was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. It was the scariest thing I have ever been through, but through the whole process the Lord has been so good! I can\u2019t wait for the day I found out I was pregnant \ud83d\ude42\nI am really encouraged by your story! This will be a blessing I am sure!\nWhen my first baby was born in May 2004, I knew she would be my last. I knew I didn\u2019t want to have any more, because the more I gave, the more I felt empty. We found out after my first baby I had a couple of miscarriages. They were in our daughter\u2019s womb when she turned 8.\nMy husband is not the type that is \u201cafraid\u201d that I would suffer anymore if we wanted a child. I am happy that we can talk openly about our decisions \u2013 and that he always supports them. I am lucky enough to be able to have a second career that I love at the moment \u2013 but being that this is my dream and I do want to be a stay at home mom, I had to reconfirm that I am able to be one.\nMy heart aches for your fears and hopes and heartache. But I also know that your hopes and dreams are so good and that this will be a beautiful journey.\nThank you so much for sharing that, it brought me to tears.\nI am in the process of getting my tubes tied and had a huge bout of fear/anxiety the day before surgery. If all goes well, I will have no ovaries to worry about in the future. It is so freeing to know you can never have a uterus pregnancy again but also the possibility that one day, I could get pregnant the old fashioned way with a baby daddy. You are a wonderful encouragement, thank you Kari.\nThank you!\nI had my tubes removed about 18 months ago after surgery for other reasons and I could never stop telling myself \u201cmy life with my children\u2026.\u201d but I keep telling myself to trust that my children will know I love them and will care for them with the same fervor as I did. Even if I have to put them down to take another life to replace one that has passed away. Not to make my husband feel any different though, he is one hundred percent on board. I love you and your family Kari and will go so far to encourage you even though my life isn\u2019t as you wish it could be. I love that your husband was brave and said out loud what everyone in my head had been saying, that you don\u2019t have to have your tubes tied, but rather if you want to. I know that I feel the same when I ask if I can still have my tubewells tested for cancer, if I say yes I will likely never know if it\u2019s a real cancer or my body\u2019s way of saying you\u2019re getting old\u2026.but if you want, you can take it. I am so scared that after my tubes are removed that I will have another surgery just to have everything removed because they don\u2019t look good\u2026.but that is when the doctor says \u201cno, you\u2019re fine\u201d and your insurance will cover it cause you have cancer. I don\u2019t know I am just so thankful for life but scared that it ends so soon. Thank you again for letting them hear these stories because it helps us know we\u2019re not alone. I pray it will all work out for you.\nPhew, so glad God brought me across blogs like this. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting my tubes tied as I\u2019ve been trying (and failing) to get pregnant for a long while. My husband never wanted it in the first place because he wanted to know what would happen should we ever get pregnant naturally. But, after reading so much about the risks and complications, especially my age, and that he\u2019s pretty sure if I get pregnant it\u2019ll be through IVF/egg donation, and that I\u2019ll be taking medication, I said the prayer of \u201cLord, if your will be, then please do.\u201d and got the blessing from my doctor after only a few minutes of talking. I was so relieved and so glad I was able to talk it through with him first so he had the chance to express whatever he needed to and could prepare me for it\u2026\nMy husband and I found out we were pregnant the day after we visited my first-grader with some back pain. I went to the doctor the next day and the doctor said that there was a possibility we could be miscarrying due to some of the early symptoms of pregnancy. It was the scariest time in my life. Since then, we have been through two miscarriage (last one at 4 months, and I miscarried at 13 weeks) . After that I never took the \u201cI hope we\u2019re pregnant soon\u201d type of attitude anymore because I would lose my second child if I was pregnant again. I was always the type of person that was afraid to lose a child. I would have been just as afraid if my baby were dying right now. After this, I have developed a stronger faith in God\u2019s plan. I\u2019m learning that God\u2019s plans for us are the very best ones \u2014 we don\u2019t deserve to have children!!! I always felt that I was so unlucky to be denied one. I know for some of my friends that have been going through the same thing. Thank you for being able to write something down \u2013 it keeps your fears at a healthier level. I\u2019m so grateful it all women who have all the courage to have the chance to speak to someone on the spot to tell my wife and son-in law school.\nSo pleased and amazed. You\u2019re so good for the first time we\u2019re able to be in charge right away.\nThank you!\nI had my eyes!\nYou\u2019re very well and good. Thank you Kari and the ability to go through with you\u2019re you and your heart.\nSo relieved I have a baby with all the desire you with your kids.\nI will to be with you for a child after!\nI\u2019m a doctor!\nI am very sure not the baby to be with my time to be with a son and daughter.\nAll right.\nI\u2019m with wife and the baby girl with you\u2019re.\nI hope to be able to talk to my heart.\nI had my baby with you!\nI\u2019ve you and your child!\nI\u2019ve with you to be with my girl!\nI\u2019m with the child with you as baby to your heart with you! 1st of you to be with you think you and your baby with you with you and your mother with you!

He was also directly insulting the majority of White voters, and the Democrats still had absolutely no fucking shit together.\n\nAnd that's the endgame, and Trump is smart enough to know it. And also the fact that the only thing preventing him getting in jail right now is all the money that he has spent and the fact that he doesn't have that much money. So if he needs to commit a crime to be able to run, I'm sure he can probably find a way to do that.\n\n\n\nThe best case scenario for Democrats was that 2020 would just fucking end, but now they've got to see it through, and Trump will fuck them up.\n\n\n\nI'm glad you guys asked that. I've been trying to figure that out for a long time. And the answer is YES, but it's a tiny tiny sliver of a sliver. And it is completely meaningless as an electoral threat to the Democratic Party. I know this because of the shit you're seeing these Democrats do. They are fucking pathetic.\n\n\n\nAnd the best thing you got is a candidate with two thirds of her brain cells damaged by the fucking DNC at the hands of this same party. This was a complete and total fucking waste of everything that happened in 2019 &amp; 2020 just for nothing. These men are completely unemployable, just not even capable of going into a meeting. And they deserve that.\n\nAnd now you're going take these guys and put them at the head of Congress, and that is something of a fucking mess. That's the last place you want to put Trump's people.\n\n\n\nI'm actually not that excited about anyone in that race at the moment.\n\n\n\nBecause I'm like, okay sure, I'll put Sanders at the front, if that's what he wants, but I will not be thrilled about what's going on with him, and even less thrilled about what's going on with the Democratic Party.\n\nNot to mention the fact that this guy never really was that kind of a leader. He was always a kind of a nice guy that didn't know much. But now, he's like, this is all my fucking fault, the fucking Democrats are gonna be in total fucking collapse because I'm such a fucking moron, and it's like, that's...\n\n\n\nI mean I feel good for him. I know it's gonna be awful for them. I'm not feeling good about any of this.

In nutrientOPT alien", "generated_output": "i can be used for the development of non-linear control systems that are subjected to uncertain control parameters and uncertain dynamics. The problem of nonlinear control of uncertain systems is in fact a well-known subject and has been dealt with in a great variety of problems. But it is more and more common to come across this problem in the context of food technology. When, for example, a process is designed it is hardly ever the aim to have linear systems. In these problems the aim is to obtain a control system which is robust in the sense that all uncertainties can be handled by the control system. Because the control system must also be robust a linear control system in not sufficient to cope with all the difficulties [2, 3].\nIn the work presented here we have considered an uncertain system which is composed of an uncertain part (nutrientOPT) embedded in a robust part. We have formulated a model where the nonlinear control problem is transferred over to a linear estimation problem. In [7] the concept of nutrientOPT is applied at various problems. In particular, the problem is set up for estimation from an uncertain plant model, of which one component is the nutrientOPT algorithm [5, 6]. In [5] the estimation problem is treated for use with a batch reactor as the first part of the plant model. In the second part the control problem of a CSTR is considered. In [6] estimation and control is combined in a single problem. The result is a CSTR where control of the concentration of the product is used within the control loop and estimation of the feed rate is used within the estimation loop. The idea of estimation and control combined is a promising idea. More research regarding this idea is needed to find out if some of the difficulties reported during the application of nutrientOPT in other industries can also be found in the context of estimation and control combined.\nIn this paper, we have developed the concept of nutrientOPT with additional information regarding the control parameters (or control variables). The aim of the present paper is to show that a certain uncertainty in the control parameters can be incorporated in a nutrientOPT estimator and to show that this gives a substantial increase of the robustness of the control system. The development of nutrientOPT with additional control parameters has as a basis the estimation algorithm of [6] to which we have transferred the control problem. This development is used for one specific example (section 4), where we present the results of three control cases. In section 3 we describe the estimation problem. Section 2 contains the introduction.\n\n#### 2.1 Unreliable data in estimation and control combined\nThe nutrientOPT application described in this paper is used to predict and control the concentrations of several substances in a system where these substances appear under differing conditions on separate occasions. In estimation and control combined we have to estimate the concentrations of the substances in the process, but the concentration of the substances cannot be measured accurately, because only parts of the substance appear in the measurement. In nutrientOPT we can take this inaccuracy into account by using a method for estimating an optimal uncertainty set that is based on the uncertainty in the process. The nutrientOPT algorithm is thus used to determine a set of the concentrations which are allowed within the measurement uncertainty. This means that information from the measurements, and from the process, is used to estimate these tolerances. With this estimate at hand a control system can be designed. The control problem is solved using a classical LTR model and with the estimates by the nutrientOPT algorithm as the data which defines the disturbances. To this end we set up the LTR model in [7] a little differently than usual.\nFor estimation and control combined we also have two kinds of uncertain information: 1) the measurement noise, i.e. the measurement uncertainty, and 2) the uncertainty in the disturbance which is caused by the unreliability of the process parameters. The measurement noise is often modelled as an additive noise with Gaussian distributions with a given mean and variance. This means that a distribution with Gaussian statistics can express everything that is know about the uncertainty, and a distribution of 95% coverage will give us a 95% confidence interval for the concentration.\nUnfortunately there is no universal method for the determination of the distributions. It is a difficult task because a great deal of experience have to be brought into play, and the knowledge of the process and its operation is necessary. To put it differently, the problem of estimation and control combined is that there is not enough information to make accurate decisions. Therefore many methods have been introduced to cope with uncertainties to meet this problem. A number of methods have been developed for the modelling of uncertainties, and among these methods the most popular are the moment method, the second moment method and the LTR method. These methods have been used in combination with the nutrientOPT algorithm to control several estimation and control problems, and with good results [7-10].\nThe second kind of uncertain information is the unreliability in the control parameters. This has been treated in [11] where a process control algorithm for an object such as the measurement process in Fig. 1. In the process, some measurement may be taken in parallel with other measurements or activities which may lead to a loss of information. We have no access to all the information of the system. The parameters of the object and related parameters are also uncertain because of the unreliability of the system under study. For instance: \"In a plant with one hundred thousand active parts there are several places where several chemical reactions take place, and the parameters defining the chemical reactions are uncertain\" [11]. This means that if we can only measure one part of the object, there is uncertainty in the parameters. The uncertainty is the cause that the estimation problem and the control problem have to be solved based on a robust model. Because the model may be robust we have to find other means to analyse this influence. In the model we have assumed that there will be a large number of uncertain parameters causing uncertainty in the model. In our application of the model we only have one uncertain parameter which causes uncertainty in the model.\n**Figure 1.** Measurement process [7]\nThe problem with uncertainties in the control system is that the resulting model is a nonlinear and discrete system, and the solution to the resulting estimation problem and the resulting control problem has to be found based on a robust model because the actual model parameters are unknown. There may be different ways of dealing with a situation like this. In this work we shall propose a particular form for solving this problem. It will be shown that by making a reasonable assumption regarding some of the disturbance parameters we can achieve better robustness in the control system and we can reach a better control result.\n\n#### 2.2 Description of the nutrientOPT algorithm\nAs mentioned above, the nutrientOPT algorithm can be used to find the allowed variations of the control parameters. A robust model of the control system is constructed based on the nutrientOPT algorithm, see [8, 9]. We start with the plant structure **P** in Fig. 2, and the measurement system in Fig. 2. As mentioned above, we assume that only one part of the chemical reaction process, for the sake of simplicity, is measured: the concentration of the product. The measurement is influenced by the process parameters _u_ _P_ , and by the measurement noise ( _v_ _0_ ) with a random distribution such as the Gaussian distribution. The measurement noise _v_ _0_ is also related to the process ( _u_ _P_ ), but this relationship is defined outside of the estimation loop. The actual information to define this relationship is the uncertainty and the disturbance. A part of the system is called an uncertain part and the uncertainties and disturbances are taken to be uncertain variables in this part of the system. The uncertain part of the process is called **Q** in Fig. 2 and the parameters are _f_ _Q_ which is the process uncertainty and the parameters related to the unreliability in the measurements.\n**Figure 2.** Measurement process with the nutrientsOPT algorithm applied to the measurement and the estimation and control problem in Fig. 1\nThe nutrientOPT algorithm is a method which uses information from the measurement of an unknown variable to determine the uncertainty in the variable. To do this we need the control and modelling parameters to have values which correspond to a Gaussian normal distribution. With this we assume that the disturbances _f_ _Q_ are Gaussian normally distributed.\nThe uncertainties in the parameters of the process can be described by the vector \u2208 in Fig 1, which contains the uncertainties in both the control and disturbance parameters. But the real values are unknown, so there are estimates \u2208 _n_ of the parameters for the model. These can be used in a robust model as\nThe uncertainty in the model is incorporated in the estimation problem **E** in Fig. 3, _E_ (\u2208) is the distribution of the uncertainties and _E_ (\u2208 _n_ ) is the distribution of the parameter estimates of the uncertainties. In Fig. 3 the model of the measurement process has been split into two parts and the parameter estimate is taken into account in the design of an estimator. The estimation problem for the control system is defined by the block **D** which consists of an estimator, a control system and the measurement.\n**Figure 3.** NutrientOPT algorithm diagram [5, 6]\nThe problem of estimation and control combined is solved with the following structure:\nIn Figure 4, the result of the nutrientOPT algorithm has been used to update the measurements and to create a new measurement noise. The block **U** is the nutrientOPT algorithm and the information is the concentration of the product and two estimates: the estimate of the concentration of the product and the estimate of the process parameters. The uncertainty in the process parameters and in the measurement process is introduced into the process by means of uncertainty in the control measurements. This is in the structure of the process the same as the measurement uncertainty and measurement noise. In an ideal situation these measurements have to be taken simultaneously, or almost simultaneously. This means that the uncertainty in the control measurements is related to the uncertainty in the measurement. This will give a robust structure in the problem. But in reality the control parameters and measurements are taken at different times, and this gives an unreliability in the control parameters and the measurements. This is described in Fig. 3.\n**Figure 4.** The structure of the estimation and control problem with the nutrientOPT algorithm applied\nIn Fig. 4 we have set up the algorithm such that the information to solve the problem in Fig. 1 is transferred from **D** to **K**. To improve the robustness in the control system the unknown _f_ _P_ of the control system is changed to _a_ _K_ which in this case is equal to _f_ _R_.\nThis means that _a_ _K_ will be a new control system and we assume that the control system has at least the following characteristics: 1) the control system is not linear, but has a small nonlinear term, 2) the system is time variant or time varying and 3) disturbances may occur.\nTo improve the performance of the nutrientOPT algorithm, and in this case to improve the control, a simple linearization was used, and with this we assume that the model which describes the process is close to the real situation. On one hand the process is nonlinear, and on the other hand with the assumption that the system is time variant or time varying we can reduce the disturbances to a small nonlinear term. Therefore, we expect that this simple linearization will give a relatively good result, the actual result for the control depends of course on the disturbances, and therefore there is also the possibility that this very simple linearization gives a bad result. When the linearization has the form:\n\n#### 2.3 LTR\nLTR is a method developed for the estimation problem [12], and when applied to the estimation problem the estimator can be used as an identification algorithm [13]. Therefore it is necessary for us to introduce the estimation problem into the estimation and control problem. The estimation problem contains information in the form of a probability distribution ( _P_ ) of the possible values of each process variable ( _x_ ), which gives a relation between the parameters that are taken into account ( _z_ ) and the process variables. The objective of the LTR estimation is to estimate these parameters ( _z_ ) from the data ( _y_ ) using a statistical model, where _h_ ( _x_ , _u_ , _z_ ) represents the plant dynamics, and _Q_ is the measurement process noise vector. The information about the error is expressed by _P_ , and the information about the process variables ( _x_ ) is expressed by _R_. With this we can use the LTR to solve the nutrientOPT algorithm in a similar way as we introduce the perturbation in the control problem.\nThe LTR of [12] is used, with some modifications, in the estimation problem in Fig. 5: the estimation problem is divided into a model **M** and the measurement model **F**. In [14] an application of the LTR to the estimation problem is presented. In the paper [14] the model **M** is considered to be known and therefore the estimation problem is transformed such that the estimate ( _x_ ) is independent of the model ( _M_ ). This can be done by solving the model with **M** ( _x_ _=0)_. This transform gives the model _F_ ( _k_ ) which can be used to solve the estimation problem without using the model **M** 2. In Fig. 5 **E** ( _x_ _=_ 1), **E** ( _z_ _=_ 2) and **E** ( _x_ _R_ _=_ 3) is used to model the perturbation ( _x_ , _z_ ) and the control parameter ( _u_ ), both in the model **M** and in the measurement _Q_. _E_ ( _x_ _R_ ) is used to solve the problem with the measurement noise as _E_ ( _Q k_). In this paper two different LTR-estimators have been implemented: the simple LTR-algorithm described in [12] and an improved LTR-algorithm based on the approach in [14]. These two algorithms has been tested and the results were compared in [12, 13].\n**Figure 5.** The structure of the estimation problem with the LTR algorithm\n\n### 3\\. Estimation problem\nThe model describing the process in Fig. 2 is defined by the relation [15]:\nwhere the output ( _P_ ) is the concentration of the product, the input is the concentration of the substrate, the control parameters _u_ _P_ _=_ [ _u_ _P1_ _u_ _P2_ ]T, ( _u_ _1_ is the change in product flow (kg*s-1) and _u_ _2_ is the change in substrate flow (kg*s-1/s-2)) and the measured disturbances are _v_ _0_ and _v_ _1_. _v_ _0_ _i_ is the process noise, and _v_ _1_ _i_ is the unreliability in the measurements.\n\n#### 3.1 Development of the nutrientOPT estimator and nutrientOPT + LTR\nThe development is based on the assumptions made for the estimation algorithm described in [6]. The first part of the plant model in Fig. 3 is a stochastic model which has the form\nwhere \u2208 [2] describes the unreliability in the control parameter.\n\n#### 3.1.1 The nutrientOPT algorithm\nThe following section contains a description and an analysis of the nutrientOPT algorithm presented in [5, 6]. First we describe the development of the nutrientOPT algorithm, which is used to model the estimation uncertainty.\nLet  = the measurement set ([ _P_ ]T is the concentration of the product and [ _u_ _P2_ ]T is the concentration of the substrate) and _=0_ is the measurement uncertainty (it will be seen later that this is estimated [5, 6, 8]). Let also **I** = \u2208 _0 T_.\n\n##### 3.1.1.1 The nutrient process\nThe measurement process can be described by a normal distribution N (\u03bc, \u03c32), where \u03bc and \u03c32 are the mean and the variance respectively. This normal distribution can be written like this:\nwhere _\u03bc_ is the mean (in our case \u03bc=[ _f_ _R_ _f_ _Q_ ]T = [ _u_ _P_ _+f_ _Q_ _T_ ] and \u03b5 is a random number with normal distribution N (), where \u03b42 is the variance.\nLet\n(3.1.1) \n(3.1.2) \nThe nutrientOPT estimation algorithm uses a nonlinear process which is divided into two parts as shown in Figure 4. The nutrient process is used to create a new distribution of the measurement noise. Let a control parameter **Q** be defined by \u2208 _T_. The measurement is defined by _\u03bc_ = _E_ ( **R** ) + \u2208 _P_. The nutrient process is set up such that the concentration measurements of the product are used in two ways:\n1) the measurement value is the mean of the new distribution where \n2) the measurement value is the mean of the estimation uncertainty and the measurement noise, \nThe uncertainty in the concentration measurements may be defined by the estimation problem, and an uncertainty in the model of the control parameters which give the control problem.\n(3.1.3) \nwhere  is the expected value of the measurement noise\n(3.1.4) \nwhere _\u03bc_ _K_ = the mean from the nutrient process after being updated with \n**E** ( **Q** ) + **E** ( **R** ) = mean of the nutrients process after the measurement was made with \u2208 _nK_\nis a matrix whose elements have the form\nwhere\nare the parameters which defines the nutrient process\nwhere **W** _T_ = [ _w_ 1 _T_ _w_ 2 _T_ ] _T_ with \n(3.1.5) \nwhere \n(3.1.6) \nwhere \n\n##### 3.1.1.2 NutrientOPT algorithm\nThe algorithm can be used to describe a control parameter uncertainty which has the shape of a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean and a variance. The goal in this algorithm is to estimate the uncertainty in the model, and use this estimate to find the uncertainty in the control parameters. If the parameters _u_ _P_ (the value of the control parameters) are found to be out of control the algorithm will suggest a change that should be made in the model.\nIn our application, the state of the control parameters is set at the initial condition and the state will be improved by changing the control parameters which describes the system. The algorithm searches for the unknown control parameter values _u_ 0. As long as control parameters are set equal to the initial value zero, the nutrient process will set up a new distribution of the measurement noise, which will give a new _x_ value. The algorithm will then use the new _x_ value to set up a new measurement noise. In the following a description of the algorithm and the procedure of the nutrient process will be given. \nStart with _t= 0_.\n1) A measurement is done where u0=0.\n_x =_ 0 _x_ and _u_ _0_ =0\n_E_ ( **R** ) = 1 _E_ ( **R** )\n_P_ ( _t_ _) = E_ ( **R** )T\nThe nutrient OPT model is used to set up a state and measurement noise.\n_Wp_ 0 _s = W_ 0 _s_\n_E_ ( **R** ) = [ _f_ _P_ 0 0]T\n_s =_ 0\n_p_ _0 =_ 0\n2) a new state is found:\nis called where _\u03b4_ is a new state,\n.\n3) _x_ 0 is found: is called where\n.\n4) New state found: is found \nWhere\nis called where _u_ 1 is found where\nis found where\nwhere\nwhere \nis called where (7) is used in\nis found where\n.\n5) is called where\nis found where\n**(2)\nis called where \nwhere\nwith \n\nFor (7) is found where is called where\n.

Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 1.1 Introduction Mechanical Vibration Engineering and science of Mechanical Vibrations deals with the excitation, detection and control of vibrations. Every mechanical system contains some degree of vibration and, to some extent, can be designed to vibrate. Vibration is the oscillatory motion of a particle about an equilibrium state. A force, as a function of time, produces an oscillation. The motion of the particle may be described by a mass-balance equation: m dv kx dx F = m(0) + 2 m(0) = dx = k x (1.1) where x is displacement, m is mass and k is stiffness. When such an equation can be exactly integrated, its solution can be described by the equation: \uf8eb m x dv \uf8f6 k = m t + A ei( t+ ) (1.2) 2 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 2 where A is an integration constant. This kind of equation can be integrated, but the solution is quite complex. When this equation was first proposed in 1669, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) concluded that a vibratory motion of a simple spring cannot be periodic. The equation m = 2k m is known as the undamped oscillation equation It has been shown that a spring mass system, at its natural frequency \u03c9n, cannot remain in a condition of harmonic vibration. If this system is excited in a manner that causes it to overshoot a point other than the equilibrium position and then return to that position, it is called in harmonic excitation since the spring and mass system is subjected to the same oscillatory force from the start. If there is no damping and the system is excited in this manner, its amplitude does not decrease to zero during vibration but remains a constant, called amplitude of oscillation, until the conditions of oscillation and excitation are no longer met; this constant is called the resonant amplitude. If the damping in a spring mass system is not too great, then vibration of the system is said to be free, but if damping is too great, then the vibration of the system ceases to be harmonic because resonance takes too great a time to occur. As the damping in the spring and mass system increases in such a way as to eventually stop the system from vibrating, oscillation becomes harmonic. When the degree of damping is large (1), the motion would be a combination of a number of modes and the system may become totally unstable. (a) The degree of damping is so small that the motion tends to be stable and the frequency and amplitude of oscillation tend not to vary significantly (i.e. it is a lightly damped system). (b) Damping is of intermediate (or medium) level (i.e. the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude tend to vary, but are not excessively affected when the motion of the system starts to occur). (c) Damping is large, causing the frequency and amplitude of oscillation to fluctuate to a large extent from 1 1 For more information, refer to L J. Goldsher, Mechanical Vibrations, McGraw-Hill 1982 Pp. 350-352 17 \n  19. 19\\.  those of the vibrating system as it starts out. This is an example of an unstable system and it may become even more unstable as the motion of the system continues. When the system can oscillate at all, the motion would be harmonic and if a harmonic motion is induced, oscillations at a single frequency exist. When the motion of a system is harmonic, the frequency of the motion is constant and the amplitude of the motion is a periodic function of time. Harmonic vibrations take the following form: x h = xm sin \u03b1t (1.3) \u03b1 is called \u2018angular frequency\u2019 and has units radians per second. The constant xm is the amplitude of oscillation and may be related to the maximum amplitude, A, as given in Eq.1.2. For the case of no damping and an unforced system, the maximum amplitude A is called the resonant amplitude or simply the amplitude at resonance. When a system is excited by the superposition (adding) of two or more harmonic vibrations having different frequencies, the result is sometimes called, in practice, compound motion for reasons which will become apparent later. It is often difficult to distinguish between damped motion and free motion when they behave so similarly, but one has to examine the form of the motion to distinguish free motion from damped one. Sometimes a small amount of motion can be sustained in a system when the system is at rest, or only when the excitation force is at a certain frequency and with a certain direction. This vibration persists for a long time and is called stationary vibration. It is often used in practice, to excite vibration of a rotor. Another type of vibration that has no special name is a vibration or a transient vibration which is the result of applying small force to a vibrating system when its equilibrium is disturbed from the point of view of its motion. For instance, the transient vibration would occur in a spring or an elastic solid when the initial displacement is not zero and is zero after the motion of the system reaches an equilibrium. Since damping is not present in the definition of transient vibration, the term transient vibration is a name to distinguish it from stationary vibration which may result in an actual stationary vibration when the equilibrium is disturbed. It is often found in technical literature that a term, \u2018Transient response\u2019 has been used to describe transient vibration. A vibration occurs whenever the equilibrium of a system is disturbed. A vibrating beam may be disturbed by a change in its support conditions, an applied force, or change in its temperature, to produce vibration (Fig. 1.1(a)). The motion is a result of force produced by gravity and the elasticity of the beam (1.4) The restoring force of the beam is also a sinusoidal function of time and the vibration of the beam will be a sinusoidal function as well. But the angular frequency 2 and the period T have different values depending on the type of excitation. The free vibration shown in Fig. 1.1(b) is called natural vibration (or simply, natural motion) which is a result of disturbance to the system from its equilibrium position at time zero (the initial displacement is zero). This type of vibration can be produced by a harmonic force only or by periodic forces which can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq.1.4. A vibrating mass system such as piston, a simple pendulum or torsional pendulum can also take excitation force, but only the case of the period of the forcing function and the period of the vibration of the system are equal to each other should be noticed. 18 \n  20. 20\\.  For the vibration of the mass, if the external force is a periodic function of t \u2013t with a period 2 2T , then the frequency of oscillation x and its period T are given by x dx 2 \u03c9 x = m = 2k = 0 2\u03c0 and T= = 2 \u03c0 x (1.5) k m If the force is a periodic function of t \u2013t with a period T, the frequency and the period of oscillation are 0 given by Eq.1.5. The case of motion occurs when the equilibrium position of the system is disturbed and the system can move around the disturbed equilibrium. The motion will continue indefinitely unless the system ceases to move because of damping or a harmonic force is applied during this motion. Because of the change in motion caused by disturbance, the type of motion is called transient motion. The motion during disturbance is not a type of steady state motion, because it has no period (i.e. it is transient motion). The steady state motion is a type of motion with a periodic function for each parameter. The motion of a system, which is disturbed by an arbitrary force, depends on the force that is a periodic function of time. 1.2 Classification of Vibration Generally speaking, mechanical vibration can be classified into two categories: (a) Harmonic vibration (b) Residual vibration Harmonic vibration consists of vibrations that have no damping and vibrations with a considerable amount of damping. Most engineering machinery and devices are subjected to harmonic vibrations. Residual vibration consists of vibration when the system is damped or the motion of the system ceases because of damping and excitation is a periodical function of time. The residual vibration is more common, but it is not of much practical importance for the following two reasons: (a) The type of residual vibration can be converted to a harmonic vibration at resonance or to a steady-state vibration by reducing the damping. (b) Almost all actual devices are unstable due to the existence of nonlinearities. If the device is slightly disturbed and allowed to execute the vibration mode, the system can easily become unstable and motion becomes non-periodic in time. 19 \n  21. 21\\.  1.3 Classification of Vibration Based on Damping A lightly damped vibration system is one in which the degree of damping (\u03b3) is so small that the motion tends to be stable and the frequency and amplitude of the vibration tend not to vary significantly. Its vibrations follow a sinusoidal curve and its solution can be expressed by \uf8eb x 2m dv \uf8f6 k = m t + A ei( t+ ) \u03b3 m = 1.6 m (1.7) \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 2 If there is considerable damping, the solution x depends on the damping ratio and has the form: ( ) \uf8f1 x = Ae i\u03c9 t + \u03b3 m = A 2 1 + (1.8) 2t \uf8eb 1 \uf8f6 \u03b3 m \uf8f4 \uf8f4 T = T0 \uf8ec1 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 0 \uf8f4 T T0 = \uf8f2 T1 < T0 < T2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 T = T0 \uf8ec1 \u2212 2 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8ed 3 \uf8f8 2i \uf8f4 T1 = T T0 \u2264 = \u2264 0 < T = T0 T1 < T2 \uf8f31 T0 T1 T2 T As can be seen from Eq.1.8, damping the vibration reduces the vibration amplitude by 2 m=1 and the period becomes greater than the natural period by 0 3 10% (for a resonance amplitude of 0.15). In fact the vibration amplitude will be a maximum when the damping ratio \u03b3 65% and a minimum when the damping ratio \u03b3 = 0.15. The period change is an example of transient or residual vibrations. The damping ratio depends on the system, is a constant value, and its value is usually fixed (i.e. there is no variation in the value of the damping ratio). 20 \n  22. 22\\.  When the degree of damping is large (\u03b3 > 0.65), the motion would be a combination of a number of modes and the system may become totally unstable. For the systems where the vibration type is stable (the lightly damped type as a rule) and the damping of the motion caused by the system is not great, the vibration is called harmonic vibration. The type of harmonic vibration can be excited when the system is subjected to harmonic force, i.e. the motion of the system is independent of the type of excitation. However, if the type of excitation is complex (other than simple harmonic), the condition is not satisfied because Eq.1.8 cannot be satisfied. From the definition of harmonic vibration, it can be stated that harmonic excitation is independent of excitation frequency and is limited to the natural vibration frequency of motion. As the excitation force on a vibrating system increases, the amplitude and period of vibration are changed accordingly. If the amplitude of excitation is a small value as compared with the critical value, the system does not become unstable and the amplitude of vibration will not be large. If the amplitude of excitation is of practical importance of the system, the type of excitation of the system becomes unstable. On the other hand, if the amplitude of harmonic excitation, i.e. the resonant amplitude of the system, is not large but is kept beyond a critical value, the type of excitation of the system still remains stable and the frequency or period of resonance of the system is not so important. When the type of excitation is of transient or residual vibrations, the critical amplitude which the type of excitation will become unstable because of the damping becomes the basis of determining whether the type of resonance will be unstable because of the damping. If the type of motion is a harmonic type (without damping), the damping ratio \u03b3 = 0 and the damping factor (1 + \u03b3 ) = 1.

The motion of the excited system is called an excitation type of motion because it is independent of the excitation type of the vibrating system. However, when the motion of the system is a transient oscillation, the system is unstable because the period of vibration is increased due to the resonance effect of system, but, since its period is the same as the natural period, the resonance can be avoided by reducing the system's amplitude of vibration in a limited condition. 21 \n  23. 23\\.  1.4 Classification of Vibration Based on the Excitation Type Vibrating systems can be classified into two categories: (a) Excited by single sinusoidal force. (b) Excited by a periodic force. A type of sinusoidal excitation (the excitation in which the form of the excitation function is a constant or a linear combination of a sinusoidal function) occurs due to random disturbance because the amplitude of the excitation is smaller than the critical value of the unstable vibration of harmonic motion. Thus the vibrating system remains in the \u2018stable condition\u2019. When the excitation amplitude exceeds the critical value of the unstable vibration, the type of excitation of the system undergoes a \u2018resonant vibration\u2019 at a natural cycle. As the excitation amplitude increases after the resonant value, the amplitude of vibration increases at each resonance. Therefore, there is no possibility of the type of excitation occurring in the natural cycle. Under such conditions the excitation becomes \u2018nonlinear\u2019 and the type of excitation is unstable and continues beyond the natural cycle. As the natural frequency in the excitation is not that which is subjected to the excitation, the type of excitation becomes periodic motion which is difficult to represent in the form of vibration. Since the natural cycle of vibration is stable in a harmonic form, the amplitude vibration remains in a stable condition for all values of amplitude vibration. If the excitation force that is harmonic is a periodical function of time, the excitation force can be expressed as: x = X (t ) = X (\u03c9 t + p ) = X e i\u03c9t = 2 2 m = X0 sin \u03c9t (1.11) X The natural vibration period of oscillation is given by 2\u03c0 X T= \u03c9 = \u03c0 2 (1.12) m Eq.1.12 means that the value of excitation depends on the type of excitation which causes the \u2018periodic type of vibration\u2019. When the excitation function is independent of the excitation function (x = x(t)), the excited system does not undergo any changes. Therefore the system is called a \u2018system independent of an excitation type\u2019. However, when the excitation function is a periodic function of type (Eq.1.11), the system undergoes resonant vibration, that is when the excitation period of the vibration and the period of vibration are equal. If the excitation period is equal to the vibration period, the excited system suffers transient oscillation (which causes sudden changes in the system) with resonance. Thus the periodic type of excitation of the type shown in Fig. 1.1(b) is called the \u2018system where excitation and vibration periods are equal (resonance)\u2019. The \u2018system where excitation and vibration periods (resonance) are equal\u2019 can be shown by Eqs.1.1 to 1.4 and Eqs.1.5 to 1.11. This system is called \u2018resonant system\u2019. If the excitation period is greater than the vibration period, the excited system suffers vibration with the transient period and transient amplitude, but does not undergo resonance. When the excitation causes periodic vibration, the excitation period is the 22 \n  24. 24\\.  resonant period of the excited system. Then the cycle period of the vibration is the same as the excitation cycle period. Hence, the system is called a resonant system \u2018under periodic excitation\u2019. The period of resonance in a periodic excitation system is not of great importance, because in a natural vibration the vibration period is the same as the natural vibration period 2 \u03c0. Since the vibration period is changed in general, the system under periodic excitation becomes unstable and the amplitude of vibration is a periodic function of time. The excitation force under periodic excitation is expressed by Eq.1.11. The value of the resonant amplitude can be given as follows: m x = X0i (1.11) = X X i 0 Therefore, using Eq.1.11, the resonant amplitude of a system where the excitation has periodic type can be written down by x = X 2m m \u03c0 (1 + \u03b3 ) 2 T= (1.13) 2 \u03c0= \u03c0 2 (1.13 can be obtained by using Eq.1.13, its value can be expressed using Eq.1.13. The equation can be written using eq.1.13. It can be written down using Eq.1.13. It can be used to simplify Eq.13. It is possible, using Eq.13. When the excitation period is different from the system vibration period, but the resonance occurs when the excitation period is the same as each other. The value of excitation can occur at one particular frequency, but the same as each other. The value of excitation period is the same as each other. \n  1.14 \n  2 \n  \n  \n  \nPage 10 the same, but the same as each.

In VictorianOPTbearing", "generated_output": " INM. \n11) Define the terms \"nominal\" and \"real.\" In terms of nominal and real GDP, how does the government and the Federal Reserve determine the target rate of inflation? Explain. In the context of the U.S. economy, how has the target rate of inflation changed between 2001 and 2020? Do prices increase at the same rate from one year to the next? Why or why not? Given this and economic, social, and political considerations, how would you argue for a lower target rate of inflation in any given year? \n12) Explain how, over time, population growth can affect the rate of inflation and how changes in monetary policy can affect population growth. Suppose the population is rising at constant rate of 1 percent per year. Can GDP growth exceed one percent per year? Explain your answer. Suppose you live in an economy with a constant population. Explain how an expansionary (i.e., stimulatory) monetary policy, including large-scale government stimulus spending and reduced interest rates, can help to reduce the rate of inflation. You may assume that this will help to raise real GDP, the nominal GDP, the employment level, and the price level. \n13) You have heard or read that the Federal Reserve wants inflation to be 2 percent per year, but the government does not. (The government does not set the target rate of inflation at all. Instead it simply targets the inflation rate at between 1 and 3 percent so as to prevent the inflation rate from getting out of control.) Explain what you would like to accomplish as you understand this goal of 2 percent per year. Would 2 percent per year be considered too low or too high? \n14) Suppose the Federal Reserve's policy objective is that the economy grows at a steady pace of 2.5 percent per year. (The economy need not always be at that level\u2014it can change in response to events, but it generally adjusts to return to its steady growth rate). Explain how this policy has the effect of bringing about the central bank's goal of steady growth over the long term. Using the data in 2015, calculate the real GDP growth from 2014 to 2015, the inflation between 2014 and 2015, the rate of real GDP growth (real GDP growth from one year to the next) between 2014 and 2015. Did this policy work and meet its goal in reaching steady growth over the long term? Explain why or why not? \n15) The Federal Reserve recently introduced a significant easing in policy, in response to the COVID-19 effect and the consequent slowdown in the economy. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the Fed funds rate to between 0\u20130.25 percent. Use the data on nominal GDP and CPI from 2018, 2019, 2020 at the same period in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and determine the inflation rate at each one of these dates, and the growth of the nominal GDP (real GDP growth from one year to the next). Are such measures of the rate of growth of the economy helpful in determining the level of the economy? Is the policy goal of 2 percent rate of inflation too low? \n16) What are the advantages of an inflationary economy? Give one example. What are the disadvantages? Give one example. What are real GDP and the price level, and why are they different? Discuss the link between the quantity of money in an economy and the price level. Can you think of any examples of economies where monetary policy had the wrong effect and the economy ended up in an inflationary cycle? Can you think of any examples of economies where monetary policy had the wrong effect and the economy ended up in a recession? Why does an expansionary monetary policy not lead to a steady increase in the price level over long periods of time? (Consider the effects on the demand for goods and the velocity of money.) What is inflation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of high rates of inflation? What does \u201ctarget 2 percent\u201d mean?

For example, a car that is driving around a circular track at a constant speed has a changing velocity, because its direction is changing. What is the formula for speed and the formula for velocity?", "prompt": "In nutrientOPTAlf", "combined_input": "Speed is the measure of how fast an object is moving, while velocity is the measure of how fast an object is moving in a specific direction. For example, a car that is driving around a circular track at a constant speed has a changing velocity, because its direction is changing. What is the formula for speed and the formula for velocity? In nutrientOPTAlf", "generated_output": "alfa-based cow and feedlot rations. Average speed is often used in rate math problems. The equation to find the average speed of an object:\n    A person driving a car  along a straight highway frequently uses the speed limit sign to make sure they are driving within the speed limit:\n\n##### **What is the difference between velocity and speed formula?**\nSpeed is the scalar quantity that shows the distance covered by a unit of time whereas velocity is the vector quantity shows the distance traveled in the given time and direction of the motion.\n\n#### **What is the formula for speed in physics?**\nCalculating speed from distance and time\nSo, if a distance x meters is covered within the time t seconds, the speed in m/s is **v=x/t**. Note that in these calculations, the time is in seconds, the distance in meters and the speed is in m/s, also known as \"meters per second\".\n\n#####  **What is the velocity equation?**\nThe equation that relates the velocity and acceleration vectors for a constant or uniform acceleration is defined as velocity = acceleration time: v = at. This is an often used physics equation so make sure you are able to rearrange it to solve for any of the variables.\n\n####  **How do I calculate velocity and speed?**\nAs distance and time are scalar quantities, the product of them always yields another scalar, the speed. And so, in this formula\n    **Speed = distance/time**\nspeed = 4 / 2 = 2 m/sec. As speed is the scalar quantity, and yet the change in the velocity of an object is equal to the vector quantity acceleration.\n\n####  **What is the speed of an object?**\nspeed is the measure of how fast an object is moving. speed is the scalar product of distance and time. speed is measured in meters/second (meters/sec.) velocity is the measure of how fast an object is moving in a specific direction. velocity is the vector product of distance and time.\n\n####  **What is the average speed?**\nAverage Speed. This is the average distance covered per time unit. In other words, it is a measure of 'distance travelled per unit time'. For example, 40 km in 2 hours, 20 km in 1 hour, etc. Average speed is used to define the speed at a certain point during an expedition.\n\n####  **What is the velocity of an object?**\nVelocity is the rate of change of the body's position with respect to a frame of reference and is a function of time. It is a vector quantity, both in S.I. units and the cgs system having both magnitude and direction. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) is called speed.\n\n#####  **How do I calculate average speed?**\naverage speed = Total distance/Total time.  \nSo you have total distance of 6.5 miles and total time of 4.25 hours.  \n6.5 miles/4.25 hours = 1.53 mph.\n\n####  **What is the average speed of a car?**\nAverage speed is a measure of the rate of motion, or how quickly something is moving, and while the speed is the rate of motion the rate includes the direction. On average, a car travels at a speed of 33.1 m s\u20131 which in our examples translates to 79.3 mph and 103.5 km/h.\n\n####  **What is the difference between average speed and velocity?**\n**Speed is just a scalar quantity and velocity** is a vector quantity that has both both magnitude and direction.\n\n####  **What is the formula for average speed physics?**\nAnswer: **d/t**. Explanation: \"Average\" means that it involves the average value of the result.\n\n#####  **How do you calculate velocity and speed from a graph?**\n**Speed can be measured from a distance-time graph** : the slope of a distance-time graph is the speed. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. If a distance-time graph is a straight line which slopes up to the right, then the speeds are constant.\n\n####  **What is the unit of speed in physics?**\ndistance/time\n\n####  **How long is 70 mph in seconds?**\nAt 28.9 meters per second (70 mph), the time to stop was 7.5 seconds, and at 14.5 meters per second (31 mph), it was 17 seconds.\n\n####  **What is the unit of speed in physics class 11?**\nThe unit of speed is **meter per second (m/s)**. SI unit of speed is m/s.\n\n####  **How long does it take to accelerate to 70 mph?**\nIt takes approximately 7.0 seconds to reach a top speed of over 70.0 mph (112 km/h). When braking at the same rate, it takes a bit longer (about 8.52 seconds) and the car comes to a stop at a speed of 33.7 mph (54.3 km/h).\n\n####  **Which of the following is an average speed of the car?**\nThe correct answer is option D) is the speed of 50.72 km/h.\n\n####  **What is the difference between velocity and speed in a physics class?**\n**Speed is a scalar, velocity is a vector.**\n\n####  **What is the difference between average speed and instantaneous speed?**\n**Instantaneous speed is the speed of an object at a particular time, while average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time to get there**. Instantaneous speed will be higher because a car accelerating has been traveling for some time before you take the speed reading.\n\n####  **Is speed a vector or a scalar quantity?**\n**Speed is a scalar quantity while velocity is a vector quantity** and its direction is from point A to point B. When velocity is mentioned it is always in reference of magnitude/speed and direction.\n\n####  **What is the speed of a bullet fired from a rifle?**\nThe bullet has a muzzle velocity of about **1,100 feet per second** , much faster than a muzzle velocity of about 800 feet per second common from a rifle, handgun, or shotgun.\n\n####  **What is the average speed of a bullet fired from a gun?**\nThe muzzle-velocity of a bullet that has been taken from a cartridge is somewhere average in the region of about 1000 feet-per-second, or about **333 meters per second** , although this average value may be a little different from gun to gun, and the data may not be totally reliable.\n\n####  **How long does it take for a bullet from a gun to make contact with its point of impact?**\nAt 300 m, a bullet will take **.** a bullet has a muzzle velocity of 1024 m/s, the impact time will be: 512m / 1024m/s = 0.5s Therefore, this means the bullet take 0.5s to make the impact on the target.\n\n####  **How do you know if a bullet is moving?**\nIf an object is not moving, we say it is in its stationary state. If an object is moving, then we cannot say that it has no speed. If an object is moving, that means it has some speed. If we talk about this in terms of magnitude of speed and its direction, then we say that an object is in motion.\n\n####  **How do you measure speed?**\nThere are three main units used to measure speed, **meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour**. Meters per second are used mostly to measure speed in long races like marathons. Kilometers per hour and miles per hour, are mainly used to measure average speeds of a journey.\n\n####  **Does a bullet have a speed?**\nWe say the bullet has speed equal to its momentum divided by its mass. \u2026 **The speed of a bullet that has been taken straight from the gun is about 200 meters per second**.\n\n####  **Does muzzle velocity increase with bullet weight?**\n**Muzzle velocity tends to decrease as bullet weight increases and vice-versa**.\n\n####  **How fast is bullet muzzle velocity?**\nFrom a muzzle velocity of 2,300 fps to a muzzle velocity of 7,020 fps, a bullet's terminal velocity will generally be between **250 fps** and 1,900 fps.", "num_tokens_generated": 1893, "OGF": 0.462158203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 43.251288414001465, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 245, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The unit of force in the SI system is a newton. force calculator. Force is a push or pull indicated by a motion that causes an object to change speed or direction or both. Calculate your weight on other planets in our solar system or on other planets or moons of other solar systems! Use the calculator below to calculate your weight on other planets. Weight Converter. Calculate it here with our BMI calculator. We define weight as a measure of the amount of matter. The calculation of the force exerted is based on both the height and gravitational acceleration. There are 9.8 newtons of force applied on the body that gives an acceleration of 158 centimeter per second square. The weight formula of a body varies on the object, its mass and the gravitational force that is acting upon it. Mass and force mass is a measure of how much matter (of a substance or an object) is, while force measures the strength of these forces. As a result, it will increase weight if a person moves from a low-gravity environment such as on the Earth to a high-gravity. Weight Formula \u2013 How to Calculate Weight. We know that, Force = Mass \u00d7 Acceleration. You know how to calculate weight of object by using density mass volume calculator, but what happens when you get confused by newtons and kilograms? It expresses the ratio of mass of the object to the acceleration produced on it by the Earth. (m 3) = (L) 3; Therefore, the formula used for area to volume conversion for a solid object is; V (Volume) = A (Area) \u00d7 L (Length). You must be logged in to \u2026 So I have a 50 pound carton, 5 pounds, but I wanted to be able to calculate the force of gravity on it so I could calculate the maximum amount of force I could exert if I were able to get the carton high above the ground. Here's how to compute the acceleration due to gravity for a specific body, given the mass and radius of that body. 6 N. The second formula is used when an alternate force is applied through a distance. I'm not sure if the force of gravity between 2 objects will always remain constant or if the strength of gravity will decrease as the objects distance increases. Calculate the acceleration of the object. It is denoted by A and is expressed as m/s2 or m/s/s or m/sec2. The formula used to calculate weight includes a normal force which is the force exerted by a surface on an. To find force, use this relationship: F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. The basic unit of weight. Mass and Density are inversely proportional to each other. Your body mass is 62kg. \u2026 It's equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time. Weight is the gravitational force acting on a force - measured in Newton's (N) - which equals mass x acceleration due to gravity. Use this easy and mobile-friendly calculator to convert between grams per milliliter and molarity. A \u2018Kilogram\u2019 is a unit of mass. Calculate the weight of an object. Force = mass x weight. 3 N. The third formula is when two equal but opposite forces are acting on an object at rest. The force F required to accelerate an object of mass m at an. To find acceleration, divide the force by the mass; a = F / m. This will give you the acceleration, in meters per second squared. Calculate the force due to gravity or weight of a body in the space based on the mass and weight of an object. Acceleration due to gravity The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is the same for all objects. Example: A force of 10.0 N is required to move a body from point A to point B at a steady speed. How to calculate force force = mass x acceleration. The weight is the amount of force exerted on a body by the gravitation of a object when placed on it. Calculate your weight on other planets in our solar system or on other planets or moons of other. For example, if a person has a mass of 80 kilograms, a weight of 80 Newtons will be acted upon. An object will be accelerated in the direction of the force that acts on it, along with increasing speed up to the point that its weight reaches the support or the weight of support. Note: The formula above assumes that the angle, \u03c6, is small and, therefore, sin(\u03c6) \u2248 tan(\u03c6) = x/L where x is the distance over which the mass moves and L is the length of the incline. In fact, the. Calculate the acceleration due to force of gravity in terms of the acceleration a of a spring that is extended an amount equal to the distance that you are from the surface of the earth. The amount of force required to set into motion a body is known as its inertia. 100 kg, the formula is = W kg \u00d7 g m/s 2. In general, the weight of any object is dependent on its mass. To calculate the area, you just need to enter a positive numeric value in any of the 3 fields of the calculator. The weight of the body is the amount of force by which it attains a downward acceleration towards the Earth. The basic principle is that force = mass \u00d7 acceleration(F = ma). As the object goes up the slope, the mass in Newton\u2019s Second Law would equal (mass of the stone)(gravitational acceleration) (sin(a)) as an acceleration to the object. As a result if we want to know the weight, we need to know the mass. So I have a 50 pound carton, 5 pounds, but I wanted to be able to calculate the force of gravity on it so I could calculate the maximum amount of force I could exert if I were able to get the carton high above the ground. How to calculate weight in grams per milliliter (g/mL). Where, W is the weight (N) F is the force (N) m is the mass (kg) M is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s 2) A simple force calculator using Newton\u2019s second law. The formula for the work W required to move an object from point A to point B is: The work done is defined as: W = Fdcos (\u03c6) where F is the force acting on the object, d is the distance traveled by the object and \u03a6 is the angle between the F and d vectors (in this example it\u2019s zero since the force is acting along the x-axis) Therefore, a 50 kg body would weigh 490N (on Earth\u2019s surface). The acceleration due to gravity near the Earth can be estimated by assuming it is caused solely by the mass of the Earth. How to Calculate the Work of a Force? The work in the formula is in joules, which is the same unit of measurement as the product of the force times distance. The weight of an object is related to acceleration. The relationship between the amount of work done by a force depends on the angle of inclination \u03c6 of the force vector as seen in the following figure: Force calculator. Calculate weight using the actual surface gravity of an object. Mass is a measure of inertia. The formula for the acceleration of a falling object from Earth\u2019s surface: a = g \u2013 g m/L. The mass does not change, but the surface of the Earth's force of gravity can change because the Earth's mass and gravitational field strength (gravitational acceleration) can change at different points on the planet Earth. where W is the weight (N) F is the force (N) m is the mass (kg) M is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s 2) A simple gravity formula for weight is: Weight = Mass x Gravity. Calculate the acceleration of the object. This calculator can be used as weight calculator or gravitational force calculator. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change in the velocity of the body. F = ma = 50. If two objects are interacting with one another, the force of gravity acting on them would be the same. Mass: Its value is determined by the amount of space within an object. This calculator uses Newton's method to solve a system of 2 or 3 non-linear equations with two or three unknowns. Use this online force calculator to calculate the force based on the mass and gravity values. By using this website, you agree to our Cookie Policy. To calculate the force acting on a body, the formula is F = (mass)(gravity). F \u2013 force measured in newtons (N) m \u2013 mass measured in kilograms (kg) a \u2013 acceleration measured in meters per second squared (m/s 2 ) Weight and mass are related but not interchangeable. If we had instead 5 N of force acting up the plane, then there would be, on the same object, a lesser acceleration, but the same result. For example, an object with 50 kg is at the Earth's surface weighs 490N. Your body mass is 112.56 kg. The weight formula in physics is given as. weight or force of an object is the product of its mass and gravitational acceleration (the mass times the acceleration due to the planet\u2019s gravity), i.e. However, in fact, an object\u2019s mass is its weight per the gravitational force of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. Acceleration has a value of 10 m/s 2. Calculates the force needed to hold a body at rest by gravity, the weight force. However, an object's mass is the same measure, regardless of location or gravitational influence. The SI unit of force is the newton, symbolized N. The formula to calculate the force is: F = m*a. An object in free fall accelerates downwards under the influence of gravity only. Mass and density are not the same. Calculate the force needed to move an object. To calculate the weight of any object in the universe, simply multiply the mass of that object by the universal gravitational constant 6.672 E-11 ! The formula for calculating the force, measured in Newtons (N), applied when gravity accelerates an object that has mass m, measured in kilograms (kg), at an acceleration of a, measured in meters per second squared (ms^-2), is: F = ma. \u2022 Calculate the force of gravity at different heights of Earth The formula you use is: w = mg. This formula says that to work out the weight, multiply the mass of the object by the gravitational field strength. The weight-to-power ratio (W/P) of a car depends on how much it weighs, as well as how much power it produces. Calculate the average net force F ave (on top of the hill). In terms of weight, the formula is: W = (m) (g). Calculate the acceleration of the object. To calculate the area, you just need to enter a positive numeric value in any of the 3 fields of the calculator. It is equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time. An object will be continuously accelerated towards the Earth as its position moves towards and away from the Earth's surface. \u2022 The acceleration of gravity due to the combined masses of Earth and Moon = g Earth + g Moon. For example, if you know the force is 10 Newtons and the mass is 5 kilograms, simply multiply them together to find the weight of the object. What is the acceleration of gravity near the centre of the moon where the gravitational field strength is 1.63 N/kg ? Here is a list of online calculators that will help you with calculations for weight, mass, density, volume or force. Here, g = gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s 2 (approx) where the value of g can vary depending on the location or gravity (more precisely, the \"standard acceleration due to gravity\", which is different from the \"average acceleration due to gravity\"). An object will not be accelerated if either there is no force acting on it, or the force is equal to the weight of the object. Gravity on the moon is only 17 percent \u2026 To calculate the force, use the formula. F = ma. The following formula is used to calculate the force of gravity of an object. It is measured in N/m\u00b2. You can calculate the gravitational force using the following formula: For example, if an object has the mass of 100 kilograms and there is 10 Newtons force acting on it, then its weight is 1000N. Gravity is a fundamental phenomenon of nature, its origins in the structure of space-time and the particles that make up the universe have been a source of interest to physicists for more than a century. Newton's Second Law of Motion states that F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. In simple words, a car\u2019s weight depends on how much something weighs. The weight, force of gravity on a body, is measured in newton. But here m and a stand for the values of the mass and acceleration, of the object. The SI system unit of the force is Newton (N). Force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration; that\u2019s to say the force \u2026 The first is the net force on the object moving along the incline. It means the force is inversely proportional to the surface area of the body and therefore, the greater the surface area, the less the gravitational force. The weight is how much the earth pulls downward on an object. The unit of Newton is the derived unit for force. Note: The formula above assumes that the angle, \u03c6, is small and, therefore, sin(\u03c6) \u2248 tan(\u03c6) = x/L where x is the distance over which the mass moves and L is the length of the incline. As a result, it will decrease weight as the planet moves away from the Sun. where F is a force. However, if you don\u2019t want to have to memorize the mass numbers for these elements, you can always go back to the periodic table and look at the mass number. How to Calculate Force. (ii) 10g of a substance weighs 8g on the moon. The work done by gravity is mgh. The formula in Newton\u2019s Second Law for the acceleration of an object is F = ma, or force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Force is a push or pull that makes an object accelerate. Weight 1. The weight formula of a body varies on the object, its mass and the gravitational force that is acting upon it. A body\u2019s weight (W) depends only on its mass (m) and the local gravity (g). Weight = mass x gravity. Formula: force = mass x acceleration F = m a. In general, the weight of any object is. If you need to, you can re-arrange the force formula for mass. Note: Enter the desired mass/weight value in the blank text field. Example: A carton with an object weighing 60kg on the Earth surface will weigh 59 N on Mars surface. How to Calculate Force? Calculate the weight. We have also simplified as you have provided the formula of the object of mass of the earth. Weight is a measure of mass, how much matter it is. Calculating force from acceleration is accomplished with little more than rearranging the basic formula for Newton's second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration. We can say that weight varies inversely with the gravitational pull. What is the average net force F ave in the first figure? The amount of body\u2019s weight on the Earth depends on the object\u2019s mass and the force by which it attains a downward acceleration towards the Earth. The force required to set something into motion is called the force of inertia. F = ma = 20 N. Another way to calculate the force is using weight as the primary factor in the formula: If we have a 10 kg object, the weight will be 98.1 N. If we have a 10 N force acting on it, the acceleration will be 0.981 m/s2. Now let us consider the situation where we have to calculate the force due to gravity of an object. If you do not know what it is and wish to calculate from the weight on a specific planet to calculate the mass of an unknown object, continue reading to the bottom of this page. Gravity or weight is the measure of the strength of a gravitational field for an object at a given location. How long will it take that object to hit the surface of the planet if it is shot upward with a velocity of 5 kg. In Newtonian physics, mass is an intrinsic property of an object, and cannot be transferred or changed. 6.23 \u00d7 10 23. How to Calculate the Weight - Formula & How to Find? By using this website, you agree to our Cookie Policy. Calculate the acceleration. If F net = 50.5 N and m = 10.0 kg, then Newton's Second Law gives us a second formula to calculate the mass: W = mg. This formula says that to work out the weight, multiply the mass of the object by the gravitational field strength. Weight is the force weight of your body, in newtons (N). F = m a = 15 m/s 2. In other words, there is an acceleration of the object towards the center of the earth. Using the formula for force, it could be expressed as: Where \"m\" is the mass, and \"g\" is the local acceleration due to gravity. Use the formula: F=m * a. where F= force, m= mass, a= acceleration It would require a more precise understanding of the planets than \u2026 How to Calculate the Weight of the Object. You will get the force in pounds. It is denoted by F. F = ma Where, m is the mass of the object F = The force applied g = acceleration due to gravity of the object The weight formula in physics is given as. Force is measured in newtons (N). In simple words, when a body is being moved by a force, but there is no change in the body\u2019s position then this is termed as equilibrium. When using a Newton meter, you are using kilogram*meters per second squared. \u2026 The force of gravity varies with your location on Earth. It's going to be a vector. So basically, mass is a measure of how much matter makes up an object. \n**calculate the force formula 2021**", "num_tokens_generated": 3998, "OGF": 0.97607421875, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 97.84063863754272, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 248, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Each set has three layers, with the outputs of the second and third layers as the inputs to the fourth layer. This means that there are five cascaded LSTM layers in total. Each layer has 256 hidden units and is followed by a layer normalization [3].\n- The first set of cascaded LSTM layers has a bidirectional mode, while the second set has a forward or reverse direction mode [4]. The bidirectional mode means that the input sequence is processed both forward and backward [5]. This makes the hierarchical encoder more robust to local and global patterns in the data [6].\n- The first set of cascaded LSTM layers is used as the bottom encoder for the multi-head attention models [7]. This means that each layer in the first set of cascaded LSTM layers has two outputs, which are used as the keys and values for the attention models. The second set of cascaded LSTM layers is used as the top encoder for the multi-head attention models [8]. This means that each layer in the second set of cascaded LSTM layers has two outputs, which are used as the queries for the attention models.\n\nThis paper shows that the proposed hierarchical encoder outperforms the standard LSTM and gated recurrent units model on four real world datasets [9]. You can find more details of this paper from the reference section [10]. This paper does not provide any examples of the hierarchical selector and cascade selector.\n\nBut don't worry, we provide some examples here. Suppose you have an input sequence x1 x2 <span class=\"marker\">...</span> xn, where x1 is the first element of the sequence, x2 is the second element, and so forth. The output of the hierarchical encoder is a list of vectors h1 h2 <span class=\"marker\">...</span> h5, where h1 is the bottom encoder (C1) with length 512, h2 is the top encoder (C2) with length 256, h3 is the middle encoder (M) with length 256, and h4 h5 are the two cascaded LSTM layers (L1 L2) with length 256 each. Each vector h (i) represents a feature vector for the ith element in the input sequence.

The 2 kg pig body size is chosen because the maximum body weight for a piglet reaches 15 kg and then the body weight of the pig can no longer increase [1]. Therefore, the optimal nutritional level is the same with the body size of 2 kg, as is shown in Table 3.4. The body size of the piglet in our model is constant and is not time dependent. Because the optimal body weight of the piglet depends on different nutrient levels that the piglet consumed, the optimal nutrient level is determined in Table 3.4 for the body size of a piglet of 2 kg. The optimal body condition of the piglet is assumed to be the same with the piglet in case of the body weight of 160 kg, because Table 3.3 shows that the nutrient condition of 2 kg pig is similar to that of 160 kg pig.Table 3.4: Nutrient OPT at Different Levels of the Nutrient Input in a Piglet (Body Size of 2 Kg), (% of Daily Requirement).

In redox reactions, it is possible for one atom in a molecule to lose, gain or share electrons depending on type of reaction. Important to know because it tells you what atoms in a molecule have gained, lost or shared electrons.\n\n### Why are oxidation and reduction two half reactions?\n\nOxidation and reduction happen at the same time, making each half reaction of a redox reaction occur in parallel, or \u201cside-by-side;\u201d as if they were \u201chalf of a giant reaction.\u201d\n\n### What is the oxidation number of nitrogen?\n\nnitrogen is considered a \u201ctypical\u201d element with an oxidation state of \u20133 in most situations; it is a good oxidizing agent on top of providing the most important element for life.However, in some of its compounds nitrogen can assume various oxidation states such as -1, +2, +4, +5 and +6.\n\n### Why do oxidation and reduction occur together?\n\nOxidation and reduction take place simultaneously. The species oxidized is losing electrons (reducing) while the species reduced is gaining electrons to become oxidized (oxidizing). Oxidation is a loss of electrons while reduction is a gain electrons.\n\n### What is oxidation number calculator?\n\nOxidation number is an imaginary value, representing the charges a free element (or compound or ion) would have if all the bonds were 100% ionic. For example, if we assign all C=C bonds to be 100% ionic, the oxidation numbers of the carbon atoms in CH2=CHCH3 would add to \u20134 (-2 x 3 + 0 = \u20132), not 0 as they actually do.\n\n### What is the oxidation number of C in CO2?\n\nOxidation Number of Carbon in Different Compounds. The oxidation number of carbon in CO2 is zero; in CO it is +2; in CH2O, CH2OH, C2H6O it is -2; in C2H4 and C2H2 it is +4 and +2 respectively.The oxidation number of C changes from -\n\n### What is the oxidation number of N in NO?\n\n\u2022 The oxidation state of N in the N03 is -5 (the sum of the oxidation numbers of the compound must equal zero).\n\u2022 The state of O is -2 (again, the sum of the oxidation numbers must equal zero).\n\u2022 The oxidation number of N is, therefore, +5.\n\n### What is oxidation number in chemistry class 11?\n\n\u2022 in an alkali metal halide, such as NaCl, the cation has an oxidation number of +1.\n\u2022 in an ion of an element in an oxidation state of +1, the oxidation number of the element is the same as the charge on the ion.\n\u2022 in an ion of an element in an oxidation state of \u20131, the oxidation number of the element is the same as the charge on the ion.\n\n### What are 4 characteristics of oxidation numbers?\n\nOxidation numbers are typically represented by integers which may be positive, negative, or zero. They are assigned to elements in a manner such that the sum of all oxidation numbers in a species is equal to the charge of that species. The compound Na2SO4 might be split up like this: 2Na: S: 4O2\u2013. If these formulas are summed up, the net charge ends up being zero. The sum of oxidation numbers must equal the charge on the species.\n\n### Why is oxidation important?\n\nFor example, oxidation causes the air surrounding us to get its color. In chemistry, oxidation and reduction describe certain processes associated with electrons that occur during chemical reactions. Oxidation and reduction always occur as a pair, for the oxidation process is always a loss of one or more electrons and the reduction is a gain of electron or an increase in oxidation number.\n\n### How do you find the oxidation number?\n\n\u2022 Sum up the oxidation numbers for the compounds and then set their sum to the charge of the reaction.\n\u2022 The compound is called a polyatomic ion if it has an oxidation number equal to a negative or positive number. Therefore, it is not an element but can be used as an ion in a reaction.\n\n### How can you identify oxidation and reduction from an oxidation reaction?\n\nTo identify whether a reaction is going to be an oxidation, a reduction, or a simple reaction to balance out, check these things:\u2022 Oxidation occurs when a species (reductor) loses electrons.\u2022 Reduction occurs when a species (oxidizer) gains electrons.\n\n### What is the oxidation number of Cl in NaCl?\n\nRemember, since Cl has \u20131 in NaCl, the oxidation of each sodium ion to sodium metal is 1. Therefore, the total of all the oxidation numbers for all the sodium ion changes is 1.\n\n### How does a redox reaction occur?\n\n\u2022 20\u2013) ion of sodium reacts with an 8+ (e.g.\n\u2022 1\u2013) ion of chlorine in salt solution, but sodium loses electrons and chlorine gains electrons.\n\u2022 Thus, one of them reacts as an oxidizing agent, while the other reacts as a reducing agent.\n\n### What is oxidation number in electrochemical cell?\n\nThe oxidation number of an ion is the charge the ion would possess if all its bonds were ionic. For example, in NaCl, the oxidation number of the element sodium, as represented by the sodium ion Na+, is +1. The oxidation number of the element chlorine in the ion Cl\u2013 is \u20131.\n\n### What is the difference between oxidation and reduction electrolysis explain with half reaction?\n\nOxidation is the process of changing the oxidation number of the reacting element(s) and electrons transfer from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent. Reduction is the process of changing oxidation number of the reacting element(s) and electrons transfer from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent.\n\n### How do you determine the oxidation number?\n\n\u2022 Oxidation numbers are obtained from the number of valence electrons present in each atom.\n\u2022 The number of valence electrons is the number of electrons present in the valence shell of an atom.\n\u2022 Atoms of most of the elements are found in a stable state by following the octet rule.\n\n### What is the difference between oxidation and reduction process?\n\nOxidation is the process of giving up electrons. Reducing is the process of receiving electrons. Therefore, the oxidation process or oxidation is always a loss of electron. Reduction process or reduction is always a gain of electrons. There are 5 oxidation and 5 reduction processes in the above reaction.\n\nOxidation number is the charge an element would have if that were chemically reduced to a monoatomic ion. Oxidation is an increase in oxidation number while reduction is a decrease in oxidation number (or vice versa).The oxidation number of a free element (a non-metal) can usually be guessed by the name.For example: Na has oxidation number +1, Cr has oxidation number +6, N has oxidation number \u20133 etc.\n\n### What is oxidation and reduction in redox reactions?\n\nOxidation number. It is a number that is assigned to an element in a chemical compound and represents the charge of the element (if it exists in that compound). Redox reactions are reactions where electrons are transferred from one atom or ion to another. During these reactions oxidation and reduction take place simultaneously.\n\n### What is oxidation number and example?\n\nOxidation number or state of an element is an important concept in chemistry and helps to understand a great range of chemistry concepts. Learn the theory, examples and practice questions for oxidation number.\n\n### How to assign the oxidation number of an element?\n\n\u2022 First assign the atoms elements their usual or typical oxidation number. For example, in NaCl, the oxidation number of sodium ion, Na+, is +1. The oxidation number of chlorine anion, Cl\u2013, is \u20131.\n\u2022 Then check if the atoms follow any of the rules.\n\n### What do you mean by oxidation and reduction reaction?\n\nOxidation and reduction are commonly used in a redox reaction. The oxygen atom is attached to hydrogen on both sides of the arrow. In the reactant side, hydrogen is the reducing agent and oxygen is oxidizing, whereas, after the reaction, hydrogen is the oxidizing agent and it is oxidized and oxygen is the reducing agent.\n\n### What happens when oxidation occurs?\n\nOxidation is when an increase in oxidation number is observed (electrons are lost). E.g. Na \u2192 Na(s) An oxygen atom gains electrons and becomes an ion (O2 \u2212) with a negative charge. Reduction is when a decrease in oxidation number is observed (electrons are gained).\n\n### What is the oxidation number of an element in a molecule?\n\nEach atom has an oxidation number, which indicates the degree of oxidation of an atom. The oxidation number is related to the charge on an ion. Therefore, they are often the same value.\n\n### How do you find the oxidation number of an element?\n\nThe elements in Group 1 metals, such as sodium (Na), exhibit a charge of +1, and the elements in Group 2 metals, lithium (Li), exhibit a charge of +1, also known as its oxidation number.\n\n### How to identify oxidation and reduction in redox reaction?\n\nRedox reactions occur as equal changes in both oxidation and reduction reactions occur simultaneously. An element can show its increasing order of oxidation is the following sequence. Oxidation numbers are defined as the numbers which are assigned to elements in a chemical combination. This number is always taken as zero for an element having a free state, such as, O2, O3 etc.\n\n### How do I determine oxidation and reduction reactions?\n\nHow Do You Identify Oxidation Reduction Reactions? The oxidation reaction is a reaction where there is an increase in oxidation state of a species. The reduction reaction is a reaction where there is a decrease in oxidation state of a species. For Example: In the following reaction: 2A + B \u2192 2C\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nWe'll start posting answers to this question next week. The oxidation states of the alkali metals always equal their group number, which is also the number of electrons in their outer orbital. Hydrogen is assigned an oxidation number of +1 when combined with non-metals, but it is -1 when combined with metals. As a general rule, an atom in its elemental form is assigned an oxidation number of 0.\n\nThe oxidation number of sulfur in the compound is -\u00ad2, and the sum of the oxidation numbers of oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur must equal zero: [(oxidation number of oxygen) \u00d73] + [(oxidation number of hydrogen) ] + (oxidation number of sulfur) =0 [(2 \u00d7 oxidation number of oxygen) ] + (1 \u00d7 oxidation number of hydrogen )] + (oxidation number of sulfur) =0\u2026\n\nThe oxidation reaction occurs when an atom gains electrons. The reduction reaction occurs when an atom loses electrons. It is not possible to assign an oxidation number to individual elements in a substance.

Not only can biological agents cause infections on a local level, but they can spread disease around the globe. When one person in an area is sickened by a pathogen, it can infect the entire area. When a human population is infected, that population may die, and the pathogen may mutate, increasing its destructive effects on humans and on the ecosystem. In addition, biological agents can be released from man-made weapons or accidentally, leading to the release of a biological agent over a wide area.\n\nBacterial agents like Salmonella are the most prevalent biological agents that create public health concerns. They can enter the human body from fecal contamination of food and water, and because these bacteria are so common, infections are fairly easy to prevent. In fact, in the United States, 1 out of 10 people will become ill from Salmonella, and 3 out of 10 will become extremely ill. The infection results in a fever that can be difficult to control. The infection can spread through the lungs, kidneys, liver, and reproductive organs. It can lead to permanent organ damage. These infections are the cause of the majority of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis, and the most common cause of illness. Some estimates show that the Salmonella bacterium can cause over 1 million illnesses worldwide each year. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of illness and death among those with gastroenteritis.\n\nInfections spread because the Salmonella bacteria live in intestines of animals and people. In the summer months, these animals can spread the infection to water, plants, and animals. During warmer weather, the pathogen can survive in the animal feces and eventually travel to animals that get their drinking water contaminated. These animals are the only likely means for the bacteria to spread to humans. For example, in a recent salmonella outbreak, people who consumed fish contaminated by fecal contamination are highly susceptible to the illness. When people become ill, this can be transmitted to others through food and water.\n\nViruses also can create outbreaks of disease. Viruses like avian influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, also known as the corona viru, pose a huge threat to public health and cause more than 4 billion dollars in direct costs to the health care system.\n\nToxicological agents, like those released from a Chernobyl fallout or the anthrax attacks in the United Seates, pose a tremendous danger to public health. The greatest threat they pose comes in their ability to spread around an area. For example, a nuclear accident at a nuclear power plant could result in widespread contamination of nuclear waste and, eventually, the local ecosystem. This contamination would pose a big health risk to the local populace.\n\nIn addition, biological hazards can have environmental impacts. Biological waste that results from outbreaks can take long periods of time before it becomes harmful to the environment. However, it may result in the accumulation of bacteria, causing other biological processes in the ecosystem to fail. As a result, there can be other environmental impacts such as reduced oxygenation, increased acidity, and increased temperatures. While these impacts are not acute for species or individuals, they can have long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem.\n\n## Controversies in Biological Hazards\n\nBiological hazards are often a matter of controversy. The debates have typically centered around the use of biological agents for warfare, and some have been more prominent than others. For example, the 2003 use of the anthrax attacks to threaten Senator Tom Ridge, then chair of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, gained international attention. This event sparked a number of debates about the use of bioterrorism, including, in some of the more egregious cases, the desire to prevent it. This debate still continues today. Furthermore, the development of biotechnology and genetic engineering has created a number of controversies surrounding the ethical use of organisms created in the laboratory.\n\nThe debate over the use of biological weapons also extends beyond warfare. For example, the anthrax attacks prompted a number of calls for a ban on the development of biological agents that could be deployed for humanitarian use. However, as discussed, the biological impacts of these agents may be so immense as to deter their development, even in humanitarian efforts. This is particularly true with biological agents that could be used to wipe out entire populations or entire areas. While many of the proposed biological agents are simply created out of bacteria, viruses, or toxin that is already present in the world, it is important to be aware of how these changes affect potential or potential threats.\n\nThe ethical use of organisms that have been modified in the laboratory will also pose future challenges. Much debate has already occurred over organisms created for agricultural purposes, such as genetically modified organisms (GMO) that could result in drought-resistant or pest-resistant food. But, as new technology is developed, such as synthetic biology, there are also significant concerns that a number of organisms could become more pathogenic than before. While such organisms could be beneficial in creating new drugs or vaccines that are specific to a particular disease, there is always the possibility that the introduction of something pathogenic, or even just something not beneficial for its use, could create a risk to public health. While public concerns are important, these are only one aspect of the debate. Another aspect is the potential for genetic modification to further threaten our ecosystems. For example, the widespread use of pesticides has caused significant erosion of the ecosystem, and the use of biological agents may cause similar changes to an ecosystem.\n\n## Key Equations\n\n\u2022 $$$$L = \\frac{E}{D}$$$$\n\n## Summary\n\n\u2022 Biological hazards are a real threat, but it is the prevention of them that can prevent widespread harm. The first step in prevention is awareness.\n\u2022 Biological agents are either naturally occurring or have been created by humans. Because people are more likely to be exposed to naturally occurring pathogens, there are many more reported cases of natural infections each year. In contrast, genetically altered organisms may be difficult or impossible to identify.\n\u2022 The lethality of an organism depends on how much of the organism enters the human body.\n\u2022 The most lethal organism is estimated to have an LD>50 of 100 billion organisms/kilogram/year. The least lethal organism is estimated to have an LD50 of 1 kilogram/year.\n\u2022 To become dangerous to humans, an organism likely must invade human flesh, so the pathogen and its vector must invade. An organism must also invade multiple people to be potent.\n\u2022 Biological hazards can develop naturally or can be created by people. Some of the most common examples of biological hazards are bacteria, viruses, toxins, and poisons. Toxicities include cancer and death.\n\u2022 Environmental risks are the resulting change in the environment and can manifest as change in temperature, acidity, and so on.\n\u2022 The environmental impact of biological hazards is most evident in their effects on animals and ecosystems. Toxicity, cancer, and death result.\n\u2022 There have been numerous legal conflicts over the use of biological agents, such as genetically modified organisms and synthetic biotechnology agents.\n\u2022 There has been tremendous discussion about the ethical use of organisms created in the laboratory. How they are developed and distributed will be determined by their environmental impact.", "num_tokens_generated": 1585, "OGF": 0.386962890625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 35.892786264419556, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 258, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Attempt to provide answers to them as well, please.", "prompt": "Dalton nutrientOPTbearing", "combined_input": "What are some of the deepest philosophical questions? Attempt to provide answers to them as well, please. Dalton nutrientOPTbearing", "generated_output": " is very common in plants, but other animals also need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (often referred to by the first letter of their chemical formulas as NPN). The most-common forms of nitrogen fixation are the nitrogenous fixation that involves chemosynthesis by mycorrhizal fungi (N-fixation) and the nitrogenous fixation that involves nitrogen fixation performed by aerobic bacteria and nitrogen fixing endophytic bacteria (N-fixation).\nN-fixation occurs more frequently in plants with a nutrient-rich medium than in soil nitrogen-poor.\nCultivars and genotypes with higher levels of nitrogen fixation have the ability to survive in harsh environments with a scarce nitrogen source.\nNitrogen fixation in legumes is accomplished when the nitrogen fixing endophytic bacterium is co-located with the host\u2019s root.\nDuring the first part of seed development, there aren\u2019t any nutrients stored in the seed, but in the endosperm, there is only starch.\nNitrogen Fixation Definition\nNitrogen fixation occurs during the photosynthesis process where plant cells take up nitrate ions from the plants or soil via their roots. These nitrate ions are reduced by the plant to nitrogen molecules, which then move into the chloroplasts for use within the plant cells via a process known as nitrogen fixation.\nNitrogen Fixation Biology\nNitrogen fixation, in the case of animal species, involves the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to an element that is easy to acquire by the animals in the form of amino acids. Plants may be the only living things that do this.\nIn certain plants, the root exudes bacteria and/or fungi that will fix atmospheric nitrogen and use it as a source of food once it has been converted into an organic form. In plants, this method is known as ammonia oxidation, and it works like this:\n- First, a large enzyme catalyst is released by the bacteria or fungus as they grow.\n- The enzyme is then used by cells to make nitrates.\n- Nitrates are then transferred from a root medium (soil) to chloroids\n- Nitrogen, then, is fixed with the assistance of sunlight.\n- The nitrogen is then converted into water through the use of a complex series of reactions that are completed in 31 steps.\nThis process may also help the tree to build a hard and durable root structure, preventing it from becoming waterlogged. The root system may have been developed into what is known as a mycorrhizal root system, a system that enables the plant to be more secure and allows for the plant to acquire more nutrients from the ground.\nWhat Causes Nitrogen To Fixate?\nSo, how can nitrogen concentrate in the chloroplasts of a plant during nitrogen fixation to make it available for energy?\nNitrogen fixation involves the plant\u2019s ability to generate ammonia, which is then transported throughout the cell\u2019s chloroplasts. These ammonia molecules are then oxidized by the light from the sun, leading to the creation of more atmospheric nitrogen, which, in this instance, is stored and held in an amino acid.\nWhat is the difference between N 2 and NH4?\nWhen carbon and oxygen are removed from a nitrogen molecule, another form of nitrogen, ammonia, is generated. This is in contrast to the hydrogen and oxygen that are contained in pure nitrogen.\nWhat Plants Fix Nitrogen\nThe two species that may be used as nitrogen-fixing plants are the clover and the alfalfa (Medicago sativa). This process is carried out by the plant as soon as chlorophyll begins to construct the plant tissue. The plants will be able to grow when there is enough energy in the atmosphere from the sun and the soil will absorb the nutrients through their roots.\nThe process of nitrogen fixation requires the interaction of two or more different elements or substances. They will also acquire energy and nitrogen, which is what they require to survive. Ammonia is a component of this process. It is a gas that can be found in the atmosphere.\nA part of this process is that the green plant will take in water and oxygen in the plant\u2019s root system. The soil nutrients are brought up and, in some cases, even the minerals and salts are brought up to provide nutrients for roots and cells. Soil carbon dioxide and moisture are other factors that affect the process. Nitrogen dioxide is yet another component of the process. This compound is a component of the atmosphere in the form of gases. Nitrogen dioxide is created when volcanic activity releases carbon dioxide into the air, which then interacts with oxygen to form the gas.\nNitrogen Fixation Vs Nitrate\nNitrate is the most easily accessible form of nitrogen in the soil. The nitrogen fixation process is used to convert this compound into a more useful form for the plant cell called ammonia. Ammonia then becomes part of the plant\u2019s food supply. The plant may then continue to grow, absorb this substance from the surrounding environment, and continue to fix nitrogen, thus ensuring that the plant\u2019s plant roots can continue to grow for the plant to consume.\nNitrogen may be considered a part of the plant\u2019s diet after the plants have been fed nitrogen-containing compounds. However, it is quite easy to convert nitrogen into ammonia and ammonia to ammonium. The plant\u2019s roots will be the ones that are responsible for this process. It is also possible to convert ammonia to ammonium.\nHow does nitrogen fixation work in soil?\nNitrogen fixers are fungi that exist along the plants\u2019 roots. They are able to use the sun\u2019s light energy to break down atmospheric nitrogen to carbon dioxide. This process is one of nitrogen fixation\u2019s three stages. This process can be started by adding the bacteria or fungi to soil using a nitrogen fertilizer or by adding the bacteria or fungi directly to the soil.\nWhat is nitrogen fixation in soil?\nNitrogen fixation involves the process that is used by plants to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that is easier to utilize by the plant\u2019s cells.\nWhat causes plants to fix nitrogen?\nIn plants, nitrogen fixation includes a complex series of chemical processes that convert nitrogen from the nitrogen-containing compounds on their leaves into a form that plants can store and use. This process is called nitrogen fixation.\nNitrogen fixers are a kind of organisms that form in the soil. They convert atmospheric nitrogen to an element that is much easier to absorb by the plant\u2019s roots and can then be used by the plant for energy. Nitrogen fixers can be beneficial to the environment in certain circumstances, but it may have negative impacts on other species if nitrogen fixation occurs.\nIs nitrogen fixation a chemical process?\n- It\u2019s when the plants use the sun\u2019s energy to bring nitrogen from the air into the plant\u2019s cells.\n- Nitrogen is made out of three atoms called nitrogen (N) which are found naturally in the air as nitrogen (N2).\n- The nitrogen in these compounds must first be converted to ammonia.\n- This will make nitrogen available for energy.\n- Ammonia can be used in food, medicine, and other products.", "num_tokens_generated": 1476, "OGF": 0.3603515625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 33.272871255874634, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 259, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
{"instruction_index": 0, "instruction": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?", "prompt": "In interpretationOPTbearing", "combined_input": "If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour? In interpretationOPTbearing", "generated_output": ", a 30-degree clockwise arc from the initial OPTbearing. For angle bearing, measure the initial angle with the horizontal from North or South. For example: 1.360\u00ba (east or west of north) 2.360\u00ba (east of south); 180\u00ba (south of north); 300\u00ba (south of east) To understand how to use bearings, draw a compass rose, then use the compass to find the correct angle. We can show angle measurements in degrees and as small degrees by using a decimal point: 90 degrees = 90\u00b0; 180 degrees = 180\u00b0; 2 degree = 2\u00b0; 65.25 degrees = 65.25 \u2013 or 90 degrees + 20.75 degrees. The most commonly supported is the standard North, South, East, and West convention. The azimuth bearing direction that we get from a GPS tracker is known as True Bearing. The compass needs a bit of practice to make the correct angle. 01 \u2013 90 degrees, is a North South bearing in this case. For angle bearings, write \u201cdegrees\u201d after the number. The compass direction is defined as moving clockwise (C) with North is always 0 degrees, South 180, East 90 and West 270 degrees. In degrees: a. 1 minute of degrees = 1/60 degrees = 0.0166667 degrees. The difference \u2026 There are two different scales typically found on a compass bearing in degrees and minutes. Since this is the common format in carpentry (see this answer to similar question), you might want to practice that. In many countries you will find degrees of latitude and longitude on a map. The true bearing is the bearing that is measured relative to the true north. So, if you know the direction between two points, you can use a compass to determine the bearing from one to the other. The compass points towards the North Pole. For example 8 degree 11' West would use \u201c8\u00ba11 W\u201d, and 95 degree 10' North would be \u201c95\u00ba10 N\u201d. 180 degrees and \u2018West\u2019 is 270 degrees. The azimuth is an angle ranging from 0 to 360 degrees, where a north-oriented line is 0 degrees and measurements are taken counterclockwise. The bearing of each branch of a tree is given along with its name. The compass point which is North - South - East - West or you may be inclined to say North - Down - East - Left, it is just a question of personal preference. True bearing. A compass heading of 180 degrees is south. For the south direction, the angle changes every other degree: 1 is 180, 2 is 181, 3 is 182 and so forth. In both formats, the degree unit is used to measure the angle. We can either write it out in a normal text format as 4\u2032 50\u2033 or we can write it using the degree symbol or the number of times a circle is divided (360 degrees) and the arc seconds or arc minutes (and arc seconds can be shortened to a single quotation mark) as 4\u00b0 50\u2032 50\u2033. The compass bearing is an angular measurement which can be represented in several ways. At a first approximation, you can think of each degree as being divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 arcseconds. The bearing of the tree in question is shown using the correct format below. This calculator is based on radius and it will help you quickly and easily calculate \u2026 When dealing with large measurements, such as our compass heading, it can be more convenient to use the DMS. A true bearing of 350 degrees would be: 1.40 degrees or 190 degrees from North. It means that the south angle is exactly equal to 180 degrees, the west angle to 270 degrees, and, of course, the north angle to exactly 0 degrees. All values except for 1, 360 and 180 should add up to 180. Use the bearing tool or add bearings to a map feature. The angles on a half-circle are called reflex angles. Degrees. This means that every 30 degree interval gives us a compass direction \u201cNorth-Northeast\u201d, \u201cNortheast\u201d, \u201cEast-Northeast\u201d, and so on. The degree symbol, is a typographical symbol that is used, among other things, to represent degrees of arc as well as temperature. 180 degrees and \u2018West\u2019 is 270 degrees. 192 degrees can be simplified. In degrees: a. A compass is an instrument used to find directions. Here are the steps. I am writing this as an answer to the question because I have a slightly more detailed answer than the post. In degrees: a. The bearing is an angle, measured in degrees east from north. 1) Degrees: Write the angle and use the abbreviations N, S, E, W to indicate the compass direction. The azimuth bearing is the direction of a line from one point of a fixed point on land to another point of a fixed point. 48\u00b015\u2019W or 135\u00b015 \u2018W 9.30' and 5.25' W 56\u00b000'W 8. To find the true bearing, you need to use this formula: X-axis-degree = 450 - X-axis-degree, where X-axis-degree refers to the x-axis degrees. The direction from one place to another on a map can be given as a bearing. Bearings are directional measurements that tell us the relative direction of a feature with respect to a reference feature in North-South, East-West, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West, Northeast or Southeast directions. One Degree is equal to 60 minutes and equal to 3600 arc-seconds.. One minute is equal 1/60 degrees and one arc-second is equal 1/60 minutes. The azimuth is an angle ranging from 0 to 360 degrees, where a north-oriented line is 0 degrees and measurements are taken counterclockwise. 2. The first line of a bearing on a compass chart is usually denoted by a 0. The compass points towards the North Pole. When you want to measure the true bearing from one point to another, use the degrees (\u00b0), minutes ('), seconds (\") format. So, for example, when it is noon or midnight, the sun is horizontal, and its angle from straight-on is exactly 90 degrees. The angle measures the turn from one compass direction to another. Bearings. The True Bearing is the direction of one location with respect to the other location. To calculate true bearings by hand, use the formula: Y-axis-degree = Y-axis-degree + X-axis-degree, where Y-axis-degree refers to that y-axis degrees. We use the DMS (degrees, minutes and seconds) system most frequently in the United states. The bearing is 180 degrees west which can be abbreviated as \u2026 This value is entered in the Bearing field in the Bearing (M) group box at the far right of the input row. To use a bearing to find the direction or position of another object on a map, you must know the base feature \u2013 the object that the bearing is from. The most commonly supported is the standard North, South, East, and West convention. And the direction of the tree line is given as 18\u00b024'. The true bearing calculator and compass points in degrees, minutes, and seconds ( DMS ) conversion tools, with charts and tables. There are 360 degrees in a circle and by subtracting or adding 90 from the given bearing, we can calculate the true bearing of each of the compass points. This is because the point in question is on the west side of the tree. For example, if a compass bearing of 45 degrees is desired, the bearings 315 and 135 degrees are acceptable. The bearing symbol is a capital letter or a combination of letters and numbers which indicates the direction of a feature. The bearing is thus formed. Find a 0 and a 15 degree right of the base feature. You can select the degree of precision for the bearing, 0\u00b0/15\u00b0/1\u00b0/10\u2019 with the radio buttons. Degrees. How to calculate true bearings? For directions between airports or other places of interest, you would first determine the coordinates of each place (airport or fixed feature), calculate the bearing between the two, then use the correct bearing to determine the true direction that you would take to get from one point to another. The compass point which is North - South - East - West or you may be inclined to say North - Down - East - Left, it is just a question of personal preference. The north direction is always on a compass bearing of 0 degrees, so you simply know that 0 and 180 degrees are north. However, if it is a degree bearing, it is different. The compass is also commonly used for the following tasks: For example, when \u2026 Bearing. The angle for the base feature depends on the feature you are using (point, line or shape) and the position it is in, if it is in a line, it is in one line half, if so it depends on whether its the last point in the line. Example: A bearing of 300 degrees gives us the bearing 120 degrees in a clockwise rotation. 2. For more details, refer to the Wikipedia article on Azimuth. The first number is the degrees for the angle you are using and the second number is the minutes. To find the corresponding compass angle, first convert the degree to decimal. If it is a compass bearing it can be further simplified by removing the zero after the degree number. A positive angle indicates a clockwise rotation, and a negative angle indicates a counter-clockwise rotation. 2. To understand the difference, take a look at the drawing: The line has a point of interest (POI) 50 meters north on the side you are pointing. You can choose to calculate either: 1. An azimuth is sometimes referred to as bearing measurement. Degrees. Each of the 180\u00b0 directions can be further divided into 450\u00b0 divisions called arcs. This value is entered in the Bearing field in the Bearing (M) group box at the far right of the input row. In degrees: a. The bearing of a line from one point of a fixed point on land to another point of a fixed point. The bearing of the line, or slope, is 51\u00b050\u201930\u2019\u2019 W. True north is 0 degrees. The first step in finding the azimuth for any given location is to figure out the location's coordinates. Therefore, the 45 degree is equal to 90 degree and 135 degree true north. 180 degree in degrees, minutes, seconds 180\u00b0 = 180 \u00b0 = 180\u00b00\u20190\u201d 180\u00b0 = 180 degrees, 0 minutes and 0 seconds 270 degree in \u2026 I\u2019m going to assume that the reference feature is a point on the tree. As with the degree of precision, the azimuth tool will calculate the azimuth of the base feature and the true direction from the base feature to the feature of interest. 180. Bearing Calculator Instructions. I\u2019m going to assume that the reference feature is a point on the tree. The azimuth bearing is the direction of a line from one point of a fixed point to another. It is a tool you use to determine the position or bearing of an object on a map. There are two different scales typically found on a compass bearing in degrees and minutes. Bearings are measured in degrees. By subtracting, adding, or multiplying the 360 degree angles, we can reduce the measurement to within the range of three special angles. The most commonly supported is the standard North, South, East, and West convention. \n30 Degree Angle Is Equivalent To \u2212, 135 Degree Angle Is Also Equivalent To, ", "num_tokens_generated": 2656, "OGF": 0.6484375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 62.13181710243225, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 260, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

This time we will find another example of how to find the sum or difference of polynomials. What is the coefficient of the trinomial\u2019s y-term? The coefficient of the 2y is 2. This can be rewritten as [latex]\\color{blue}{\\left(-2+2\\right)}x^{\\color{blue}{\\left(-2\\right)}+1}+\\color{red}{\\left(-3+2\\right)}\\left(x^2\\right)^{\\color{red}{\\left(-3\\right)}+1}[/latex] [latex]=0+\\color{red}{-6x^2}[/latex] Here is the final form of the difference of squares trinomial. There are 12 tiles arranged in 3 rows and 4 columns. So, our answer is 180 meters. (Remember, y2 is equal to y*y). The first step is: 5 + (-2) = 3. So, our answer is [latex]5x^3-\\cancel{9x^2}+4\\cancel{x^2}-5x+23x-14[ /latex]. 4 + (\u20136) = \u20132. The sum of the coefficients of the binomial expansion nCrX(X\u20131) is equal to (n-1)C(r-1), as this page shows, and it is because X(X\u20131) = X\u00b2 \u2013 X and the sum of the coefficients of X\u00b2 \u2013 X is nC0 + nC1, hence the answer is (n-1)C(r-1). When we do this, we are expanding the binomial by adding all the terms in the polynomial. We have more information to use in this problem. We will now write the expression: [latex]\\left(8x^2 + 36x+72\\pm \\left(-7x-50\\right)\\right)\\left(13x^2-4x-10\\pm 32x\\right)[/latex]. 2017-2020 CPM Educational Program. This is possible, but for this we will be using a method called the 'Distributive Property', although this is not our main source here. What is the coefficient of the monomial at the end of the polynomial? Use the order of operations to group the numbers with the same exponents together. To answer this question we should have looked at how much water a fish tank can hold using the formula: volume = cubic feet = length * width * height. The answer is, 123\\. You start by adding the coefficients and then multiplying the results by the common variable, x, like this: This is an example that we showed in the previous section. Our answer is 330. The next one we will do is [latex]5x^3y\\pm -9xy^2[/latex]. 400 meters is to walk, and you are going to bike 500 meters. Then, you need to multiply each of the inner terms by any coefficients that are present on the outside, along with the terms themselves: This is all easy enough, but what are you going use to do this? This is the last step in the process. 5x +. Now with respect to the problem: 10 \u00f7 2 + 14 \u00f7 3 and we do the same as before we get (10 \u00f7 2) + (14 \u00f7 3) = 5 + 4 = 9. Now let's look at a case using integers (not just positive and negative fractions), such as: [latex]\\left(3\\times 9^2+2\\times 9\\pm 3\\right)\\left(-5\\right)[/latex]. Example 4) Here, we will use the distributive property and find the following: [latex]\\left(12x^2y\\pm -18xy^2\\right)\\left(4x^2y^2\\pm 2xy-1\\right)[/latex]. Here are the instructions for adding and subtracting: You add or subtract each number by combining the coefficients of each variable. Use the rules for exponents and simplify as much as possible. When we do this, we are expanding the binomial by adding all the terms in the polynomial. Find the sum or difference of the polynomials by combining like terms: [latex]5x^3-\\cancel{9x^2}+4\\cancel{x^2}-5x+23x-14[/latex], [latex](a+1)x+(1+2)y+(a-2)[/latex]. What is the first step in grouping the terms of the expression? 2004-2020 CPM Educational Program. Multiplying Polynomials Using Horizontal Method 2. Solution: The coefficient of the second term is -3. The number of columns is y = 4. When adding expressions with variables, just add the numerical coefficients (numbers in front of the variable) and then add the variables. 3. To find the coefficient of the term, we use the notation: [latex]a_{n,k}[/latex]. What is the coefficient of the trinomial\u2019s y- term? We need to multiply all the terms in one set of parentheses with all the terms in the other set. A coefficient is a number next to a variable that 1, y, and y2 are the variables. This will give you your answer. 15281.25 hours. The coefficient of the y-term is what the problem asks. There are 6 tiles arranged in a row. By the way, if you are only a student who wants to check your math homework, the online calculator is a free utility you can use when you need to solve polynomials of any degree or when you want to learn how to do it yourself. The difference in the amount of money is 300. Example 14) Here we will look at grouping a rational expression: [latex]\\left(\\frac{2x^2y+3}{y-3}+\\frac{x}{3y}\\right)\\left(y-11\\right)[/latex]. What is the coefficient of the x2-term in the polynomial? In your example there are no coefficients to multiply by, so the answer will be the same as 6y. The answer is 188.6. Step 3: Adding the Coefficients In this problem, we should add the coefficients of both terms to get the constant like this: [latex]\\cancel{8a^{-3}}\\left(-2a^3+\\color{red}{3}a\\right)=\\cancel{8a^{-3}}\\left(-2a^3+\\color{red}{3}a\\right)[/latex], This will give you your answer with the exponent still negative. When you add or subtract expressions you need to identify which of the terms have coefficients, and which of the terms have variables. 4. Example 1. The difference in the amount of money is $300. The answer is: 4. There are 10 tiles arranged in 2 rows. There are 8 tiles arranged in rows and columns. You add or subtract the same number of columns. We want to use the distributive property, but the variable in the second polynomial is not in parentheses. When we talk about terms having the same variables raised to the same power, we call them like terms. We will start with the expression: [latex]\\left(6ab-ab-4ac\\right)\\left(9b\\right)[/latex]. Here are the instructions for adding and subtracting: Identify the constant term in the polynomial that you need to subtract from. You start by adding the coefficients and then multiplying the results by the common variable, x, like this: 5x + (-2)x and the answer is 3x. The product of the binomial factors will have two distinct terms. Use the order of operations to remove the parenthesis and then identify the constant term. So, we can put each part of the expression into parentheses along with the original expression, like this: (3x2 - 9x + 12)(x2 - 2x - 3). Here are the instructions for adding and subtracting: Identify the constant term in the polynomial that you need to add to. Notice that we are adding x3 + x3, which is the same number just multiplied by 2. 2x 5 - 2x 4 + 3x 3 + 4x 2 - 5x + 6. To get rid of the parentheses on the left you simply distribute the -1 from the left parenthesis to each of the three terms. To answer this question you have to add the numbers: 650 + 350 = 1000 meters. This coefficient is positive. Here are the instructions for adding and subtracting: Add both terms on the same side of the equation to find the constant term, or the term that contains only numbers. There will be a polynomial in your answer that has as many terms as the amount of different combinations of the two original polynomials: [latex]\\left(10x^4-24x\\right)\\left(8x^2-7x+2\\right)=[/latex]. If we were solving equations with just the addition and subtraction operations, we could have taken this farther. Here are the instructions for adding and subtracting: Put the coefficients and variables with the same exponents together. What is the coefficient of the first term in a trinomial? The difference in the amount of money is 300. So this problem is a good one to test your ability here. To do this, you need to look at each set and try to find the same factors in both sets. Find the product for the following polynomial: (3x+1)(x+1)(2x+1). This is the same question as: How high will a fish be if it is 4 feet tall? This answer is [latex]a\\left(6x^4-7x\\right)+2\\left(-3x-2\\right)[/latex]. When you expand a binomial you are taking the two different terms in the binomial and multiplying them by every term on the other polynomial. Then click on the calculator\u2019s 'calculate' function on the main display. The total amount of money that both students have is x = $530. A lot of people have different definitions for the meaning of combining like terms, but for our purposes, it means that when you add polynomials you are adding the polynomial terms together in such a way that they are grouped by the polynomial terms from same degree, which means that only terms in the same exponent can be added. As such we do. Now let's look at a case using integers (not just positive and negative fractions), such as: [latex](\\frac{1}{9}\\times 9^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\times 9+\\frac{1}{18})\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)[/latex]. This is the coefficient of the x-term. 9. Multiply x (2x + 3x + 4) = x * 7x + x * 4. This means that you first multiply the coefficients, then you multiply the common variable. The first step is: 5 + (-2) = 3. We also know that a + b + c = 15. The constant term in the polynomial is the term that contains only numbers, that is, the term without any variables. The first step is: -12 + 10 = -2. Let's look at this expression: Here's the equation that it breaks down into: We can see that if we want to get more than one term we will need to repeat the above process in a certain pattern. We multiply the coefficient with the exponents of each variable, so we get: (-2*2)x6 = (-4)x6 x = x-1 y = y-1 z = z-1. The constant term in the polynomial is 5. For example, if [latex]x=3[/latex], the result is [latex](3\\times 4\\times 12)\\left(3^7\\right)=15,126,727,123[/latex]. The coefficient is a multiplication constant like 4 in the expression 4x or for x\u00b2 it is 1. Let's look at a case using integers (not just positive and negative fractions), such as: [latex]\\frac{1}{9}\\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\times -36\\right)+(\\frac{1}{9})\\left(-14\\right)\\times \\frac{1}{27}[/latex]. What is the coefficient of the first term in a trinomial? Just remember that we can\u2019t add them together since they represent different units (minutes and hours). Here is an example: Now let's look at an example where the variables are not in parentheses: Here is how this problem breaks down: Let's look at an example using fractions: Here is how this problem breaks down: Let's do two complicated examples: This will give you your answer. For example, look at this case: We can see that: (1) 6 * 15 = 90 And (2) 4 * 15 = 60. So, to find the answer, we'll find the coefficients first, then the variables: This is our answer: The third term is the first term multiplied by 2. The constant term in the polynomial is 180. It is usually a number or a variable next to a sign in an algebric expression (such as a + or a \u2212).This is what allows us to simplify expressions in the future.. Here are some sample questions to get you started. When we do this, we have to multiply each term in one set of parentheses with each term in the other polynomial. It is also a number of boxes in each row you can put or take away. Here is the best, easiest, method I have seen so far for adding polynomials and then subtracting polynomials.

In this class, the main focus will be on the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. But first, I'd like to summarize what we have learned thus far. Let's consider QFT in d=4, $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SUSY (which we can define from the 3d CFT in the dual geometry) with a mass deformed vacuum $$ {\\mathcal{L}}\\supset -(1+\\eta M^2)\\Psi^2 - \\frac{d}{d\\bar{\\Psi}}\\Psi\\wedge \\bar{\\Psi}\\,. $$ Then, we have the AdS/CFT correspondence in the mass parameter for large $\\eta$ and large $M^2$. We have found that the supergravity (AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$) description is captured by using the CFT$_2$ data and the $\\overline{G}_3$ flow, $\\overline{G}_4\\rightarrow \\overline{G}_3\\oplus M$.\nBut in fact the 4d N=4 CFT could be understood from the physics of the 3d boundary CFT (this is the holographic limit). From the holography, it is implied that there is a 3d CFT in the boundary of the 4d boundary with the central-charge $c\\propto -M^2$. The CFT$_2$ with the same central-charge could be constructed from the boundary theory in the 4d bulk. Then by demanding some conditions to avoid the conformal anomaly, we can conclude that, to the first nontrivial order in $M$, the bulk geometry is the asymptotically AdS$_3$ solution with a mass $M$ and the corresponding boundary theory is the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, whose central-charge should be calculated by the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ construction. Also, the 4d field theory is expected to describe strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theory whose vacuum is the large-N limit of the pure gauge theory. Therefore we expect that the 4d vacuum should be supersymmetric and have conformal symmetry as the 3d boundary CFT.\nOne of the important physical questions is that if we could define the 3d CFT at the origin $x\\approx 0$. We know that if we do so, then the AdS$_4$ limit corresponds to the N=4 SYM vacuum theory and the CFT$_2$ description matches (but in a different way) to the gravity dual, AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. But we would like to construct the CFT$_2$ starting from the 3d boundary CFT. And furthermore we would like to construct the CFT$_2$ at the origin and to match it with the CFT$_2$ at a finite distance $l$ ($l\\ll 1$). So our task is to find out what's the CFT$_2$ at the mass deformed vacuum $x=\\tilde{x}=0=(\\eta,M)$, even though we could start with $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and the CFT$_2$ in the boundary.\nWe found that if you define such field theory, it is not quite the same as $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. It is an 'improved' SYM theory with additional matter and higher derivatives with $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. Thus it could be a better approximation to gravity (at low energy). This theory has a large number of operators so that we could not use it as a gravity dual. The key point here is that the mass deformation breaks $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SUSY, but not the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY. We were able to construct the action and define the fields.\nThen I would like to explain what is the field theory description of the 3d boundary (CFT$_2$). We should think of it'd in terms of the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $d=0$ supersymmetry. In the $d=0$ CFT, the central charge for the first nontrivial order in the mass deformation $M^2$ is proportional to $kM^2$, where $k\\sim 1/N$. This should be related to the $c_2$. In the gravity dual description, the central charge should be related to the volume $\\frac{1}{kM^2}=\\frac{1}{M^2}\\ell_m^2$ which is similar to the scaling dimension $\\ell_m^2$. Thus we should take $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ where $\\kappa$ is some constant (I am not sure if the precise value is available or not). The central-charge in $d=0$ CFT might have better interpretation (as a quantum of central charge), especially when we consider the large-$N$ limit. As I mentioned in a previous post, central-charge has an interpretation as a quantum of central-charge, which is used to describe quantum phase transitions. In this case, $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ could be a quantum of $c$.\nSo, the key is that how to understand $c$ in the 4d SYM, which is the same $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$. How to relate this to the description, which is given from the 3d boundary CFT$_2$ where this central charge came from? As I mentioned before, we have used the fact that this 3d CFT$_2$ could be defined by the conformal anomalies and they cancel at the origin. The crucial observation is that the mass deformation in the bulk should be described by two different types of deformations: the mass deformation of the theory and the mass deformation of the horizon. This is the critical point. If we can define the CFT$_2$ on the vacuum that matches the bulk behavior at the origin, then it could be described by the two types of deformations.\nIndeed, we can construct the theory where the vacuum is the origin. This is the result that I would like to report to you before we leave the subject. I'll sketch it now.\nIn the AdS$_4$ dual theory, we can understand the 4d SYM theory in a simple way. In the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, the theory is described by the 16 superfields in the vector multiplets. We can study this as an $N$ free scalar theory and, in particular, we can consider the case of 2-point functions of single free scalar fields. This gives rise to the $\\mathcal{N}=4$SYM partition function in the form of a conformal dimension $\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{1}{8}\\ell^2$ where $\\ell^2$ is the scaling dimension. The conformal dimension $\\ell^2$ is related to the central charge (through $c=2\\pi\\hbar$ where $\\hbar$ is a constant). This constant factor is fixed by the energy scale in the field theory and, in fact, this is what we got from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ calculation: the constant is proportional to $M^4$ so that $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM has the $M^2$ central charge.\nAs for $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM, it's not that hard to see that this central charge is not enough to match the behavior of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM since the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ is the minimal $\\mathcal{N}$ conformal field theory, so it cannot be dual to the AdS$_4$ vacuum. In this way, the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM should have a much larger central charge, which is proportional to $M^6$.\nInstead, we could consider the CFT$_2$ which is dual to AdS$_3$ with the central charge $c_2\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ which is related to the conformal symmetry, which could be obtained from the anomalous behavior. And the CFT$_2$ with this central charge has been constructed by using conformal anomaly in the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory in the AdS$_4$ dual description. I mean it's a little hard to get this CFT$_2$ itself. We will understand the CFT$_2$ with some kind of $N=2$ SUSY in the next lecture. But then you could calculate the behavior at the origin by taking the low energy limit of this theory and comparing it with the vacuum solution in the AdS$_3$ description. Thus you can get the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY in the boundary $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY in the bulk with the similar relation to the $M^2$ and the central charecter in the bulk (they are both independent of 4d N=2 SUSY).\nThen, as I mentioned before, we could try to find any kind of fields and find out the behavior at the origin and then study this to better understand the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. If we can find the CFT$_2$ at the origin, we would like to find the CFT$_2$ at finite distance from the origin. The point is that the CFT$_2$ we've derived from the CFT$_2$ at the origin should be the effective field theory of the CFT$_2$ at the origin and we should find a way to relate them.\nThe CFT$_2$ at the origin is a minimal $\\mathcal{N}=1$ conformal field theory in three coordinates, which has a conformal dimension that is the same as the one of CFT$_2$ in d=3, the one we have given in the previous post. We can derive this kind of CFT$_2$ from the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. The 4d SYM has conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. The CFT$_2$ at the origin might be a better description of the theory at the origin because the field theory that we're discussing here has more supersymmetry. This is basically because the CFT$_2$ at the origin is $\\mathcal{N}=1$ CFT and the CFT$_2$ in the boundary at a finite distance has $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY with supersymmetry (for $l\\gg M$). We hope to build the CFT$_2$ in the boundary with this additional supersymmetry and conformal symmetry and then to match it with the CFT$_2$ at the origin. Furthermore, we hope to do so by using the conformal anomaly of this CFT$_2$. To do so, we would like to find out which field could come out of the CFT$_2$ at the origin and compare it with the CFT$_2$ in the boundary.\nTherefore, what we need to know are the fields which come out of the CFT$_2$ with central charge $c\\sim M^2$. Thus we need to understand the low energy limit of this field by using AdS$_3$.\nLet's consider AdS$_3$ with mass $m$. This is nothing but the conformal dimension in the CFT$_2$ at the origin. As described in the previous post, when we consider the CFT$_2$ at the origin, we should consider this mass deformation (or in the physics language, deformation of AdS$_3$) to understand the CFT$_2$ at the origin. This $\\mathcal{N}=1$ AdS$_3$ description can be used to define the CFT$_2$ with $c\\sim m^2$. Now we consider the CFT$_2$ at the origin which can be defined from the conformal anomaly in the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. But this AdS$_3$ describes the CFT$_2$ with $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{m^2}$. So how to match this CFT$_2$ with this CFT$_2$ at the origin? To do so, we study the low energy limit of the latter and compare it with the low energy limit in the former (AdS$_3$).", "num_tokens_generated": 2568, "OGF": 0.626953125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 60.236279249191284, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 277, "chunk_index": 6, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

C++ program has been developed to compute the minimum weight in the spanning tree. A spanning tree of a graph G, is a tree that connects all vertices of the graph G. For a given graph G = (V,E), there can be multiple spanning trees, but the minimum spanning tree has the least sum of edge weights. Let's consider a minimum spanning tree T, which contains the edges {(6, 2), (1, 4), (5, 4), (1, 2). \u2022 Prim's MST algorithm is based on the. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. Here's a good tutorial to start your study . There are many possible spanning trees of a graph \u2013 each has its own cost. This can be formulated as a spanning tree problem and addressed by a number of algorithm, such as Prim's and Kruskal's. 3.1 \u2022 Let G=(V,E) be an undirected weighted graph. Algorithm 1: Prim\u2019s algorithm using heap priority queue \u2022 The idea has been inspired by the analysis of Prim\u2019s Algorithm (refer to class #10) and the Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm (class #13) \u2022 The running time complexity for each iteration, \u2018n\u2019 in number of nodes in the graph, of while loop is The number of unique edges in MST. Prim\u2019s Minimum Spanning Tree. The Prim's algorithm could find a minimum spanning tree of a graph more quickly. Spanning Tree. A minimum spanning tree is a sub-graph of the given graph, which has all the vertices covered with the minimum number of edges and no cycles are formed. 388. Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. If all the edges weights are distinct, then a spanning tree does not exist with distinct edge-cost weights. Kruskal\u2019s MST algorithm is an algorithm that is used to find out the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree with the smallest weight (sum of edge Weights). 3.2 \u2022 We can also be more specific and talk about an edge in some MST \u2013 This edge is sometimes called a light edge or a safe edge and is always in some MST. The algorithm finds the solution at each step which has few paths. C++ Examples, C++ Codes and programs,C++ Programs To Perform Various Operations and Implement Graphs in C++ The algorithm starts with an empty spanning tree. A spanning tree of a graph G, is a tree that connects all vertices of the graph G. For a given graph G = (V,E), there can be multiple spanning trees, but the minimum spanning tree has the least sum of edge weights. Minimum spanning tree (MST) is graph theory concept that deals with the application of greedy algorithm. \u2022 A spanning tree for a weighted graph is not unique. 1. Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Trees Description Kruskal\u2019s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which. In each step, it selects the lowest weight edge that connects the two trees. Algorithm. Let G = (V, E) be a weighted connected undirected graph. The problem 1: Given: Weighted graph G 2: Question: Give the minimum spanning tree for G 3: Solution: Use Prim\u2019s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for G 4: Prim\u2019s algorithm: A greedy algorithm that grows a minimum spanning tree, starting from an arbitrary vertex. Minimum spanning tree using priority_queue. Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges can be \u2026 A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree with the smallest weight (sum of edge Weights). The following are examples of different spanning trees: There are many possible spanning trees of a graph \u2013 each has its own cost. So, if G1 is a min. Each tree must pass through every node of the graph without cycles, and for that, it is mandatory for each vertex to have an edge in the tree that connects to at least one other vertex (except the case of a single vertex graph). A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. Spanning Tree is a graph without loops. It is, however, possible to find a minimum spanning tree more quickly.

Output: Length of longest palindromic substring. 18 VIEWS . How does it work? 3. This longest palindrome Subsequence (also longest Palindromic Subsequence problem) is the basis for determining if a string is a palindrome. In the given example, the LCS between strings \"GEEKSFORGEEKS\" and \"AGEEKSDFORGEEKS\" is \"GEEKSGEEKS\". Note: Unlike 0-1 knapsack problem, here we can break elements. Example 1: Input: A = \u201cbeabeefeab\u201d Output: 5 Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is \u201cabeefe\u201d, which has length = 5. Given a sequence of bracket characters in one String. Now for i = 4 and j = 5, we update dp[5][4] because 2 > 1. So they have decided to increase the rules of the game. Given the array of integers nums, you will \u2026 Find longest substring that contains k unique characters. We will check if current character of str1 is the same as current character of str2. Algorithm : For every substring, we get the length of Longest Common Sub-Series. Problem. 1. LeetCode \u2013 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) April 30, 2014 by Sumit Jain Objective : Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them and also print longest subsequence.. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. The function should return a list of length 2, containing the common subsequence and its length. The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two). The input to the function is two strings X and Y. For example, \u2026 Given two strings A and B, find the length of longest sub-string present in both the strings. To create a palindrome, we can reverse a substring and insert it to the original string. For example, if string ABCDGHLQR and string AEDFHR is given as input, then your function should return \u2026 C++ Algorithm longest Common Subsequence (LCS), find longest common sub-string. For instance, if the first person chooses rock, the second person has to choose scissors to win the game. ... 211.java, 212.java 209.java 204.java 222.java. LCS problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. For example, if the first person chooses paper, the second person has to choose the same to win the game. 330 VIEWS. Write an efficient C program to find the length of longest consecutive subsequence. 544. Subset sum problem can be divided into two subsets with equal sum. What is the worst-case running time of the brute force algorithm? 3.
