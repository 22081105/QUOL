In this class, the main focus will be on the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. But first, I'd like to summarize what we have learned thus far. Let's consider QFT in d=4, $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SUSY (which we can define from the 3d CFT in the dual geometry) with a mass deformed vacuum $$ {\\mathcal{L}}\\supset -(1+\\eta M^2)\\Psi^2 - \\frac{d}{d\\bar{\\Psi}}\\Psi\\wedge \\bar{\\Psi}\\,. $$ Then, we have the AdS/CFT correspondence in the mass parameter for large $\\eta$ and large $M^2$. We have found that the supergravity (AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$) description is captured by using the CFT$_2$ data and the $\\overline{G}_3$ flow, $\\overline{G}_4\\rightarrow \\overline{G}_3\\oplus M$.\nBut in fact the 4d N=4 CFT could be understood from the physics of the 3d boundary CFT (this is the holographic limit). From the holography, it is implied that there is a 3d CFT in the boundary of the 4d boundary with the central-charge $c\\propto -M^2$. The CFT$_2$ with the same central-charge could be constructed from the boundary theory in the 4d bulk. Then by demanding some conditions to avoid the conformal anomaly, we can conclude that, to the first nontrivial order in $M$, the bulk geometry is the asymptotically AdS$_3$ solution with a mass $M$ and the corresponding boundary theory is the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, whose central-charge should be calculated by the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ construction. Also, the 4d field theory is expected to describe strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theory whose vacuum is the large-N limit of the pure gauge theory. Therefore we expect that the 4d vacuum should be supersymmetric and have conformal symmetry as the 3d boundary CFT.\nOne of the important physical questions is that if we could define the 3d CFT at the origin $x\\approx 0$. We know that if we do so, then the AdS$_4$ limit corresponds to the N=4 SYM vacuum theory and the CFT$_2$ description matches (but in a different way) to the gravity dual, AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. But we would like to construct the CFT$_2$ starting from the 3d boundary CFT. And furthermore we would like to construct the CFT$_2$ at the origin and to match it with the CFT$_2$ at a finite distance $l$ ($l\\ll 1$). So our task is to find out what's the CFT$_2$ at the mass deformed vacuum $x=\\tilde{x}=0=(\\eta,M)$, even though we could start with $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and the CFT$_2$ in the boundary.\nWe found that if you define such field theory, it is not quite the same as $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. It is an 'improved' SYM theory with additional matter and higher derivatives with $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. Thus it could be a better approximation to gravity (at low energy). This theory has a large number of operators so that we could not use it as a gravity dual. The key point here is that the mass deformation breaks $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SUSY, but not the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY. We were able to construct the action and define the fields.\nThen I would like to explain what is the field theory description of the 3d boundary (CFT$_2$). We should think of it'd in terms of the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $d=0$ supersymmetry. In the $d=0$ CFT, the central charge for the first nontrivial order in the mass deformation $M^2$ is proportional to $kM^2$, where $k\\sim 1/N$. This should be related to the $c_2$. In the gravity dual description, the central charge should be related to the volume $\\frac{1}{kM^2}=\\frac{1}{M^2}\\ell_m^2$ which is similar to the scaling dimension $\\ell_m^2$. Thus we should take $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ where $\\kappa$ is some constant (I am not sure if the precise value is available or not). The central-charge in $d=0$ CFT might have better interpretation (as a quantum of central charge), especially when we consider the large-$N$ limit. As I mentioned in a previous post, central-charge has an interpretation as a quantum of central-charge, which is used to describe quantum phase transitions. In this case, $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ could be a quantum of $c$.\nSo, the key is that how to understand $c$ in the 4d SYM, which is the same $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$. How to relate this to the description, which is given from the 3d boundary CFT$_2$ where this central charge came from? As I mentioned before, we have used the fact that this 3d CFT$_2$ could be defined by the conformal anomalies and they cancel at the origin. The crucial observation is that the mass deformation in the bulk should be described by two different types of deformations: the mass deformation of the theory and the mass deformation of the horizon. This is the critical point. If we can define the CFT$_2$ on the vacuum that matches the bulk behavior at the origin, then it could be described by the two types of deformations.\nIndeed, we can construct the theory where the vacuum is the origin. This is the result that I would like to report to you before we leave the subject. I'll sketch it now.\nIn the AdS$_4$ dual theory, we can understand the 4d SYM theory in a simple way. In the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, the theory is described by the 16 superfields in the vector multiplets. We can study this as an $N$ free scalar theory and, in particular, we can consider the case of 2-point functions of single free scalar fields. This gives rise to the $\\mathcal{N}=4$SYM partition function in the form of a conformal dimension $\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{1}{8}\\ell^2$ where $\\ell^2$ is the scaling dimension. The conformal dimension $\\ell^2$ is related to the central charge (through $c=2\\pi\\hbar$ where $\\hbar$ is a constant). This constant factor is fixed by the energy scale in the field theory and, in fact, this is what we got from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ calculation: the constant is proportional to $M^4$ so that $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM has the $M^2$ central charge.\nAs for $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM, it's not that hard to see that this central charge is not enough to match the behavior of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM since the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ is the minimal $\\mathcal{N}$ conformal field theory, so it cannot be dual to the AdS$_4$ vacuum. In this way, the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM should have a much larger central charge, which is proportional to $M^6$.\nInstead, we could consider the CFT$_2$ which is dual to AdS$_3$ with the central charge $c_2\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{M^2}$ which is related to the conformal symmetry, which could be obtained from the anomalous behavior. And the CFT$_2$ with this central charge has been constructed by using conformal anomaly in the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory in the AdS$_4$ dual description. I mean it's a little hard to get this CFT$_2$ itself. We will understand the CFT$_2$ with some kind of $N=2$ SUSY in the next lecture. But then you could calculate the behavior at the origin by taking the low energy limit of this theory and comparing it with the vacuum solution in the AdS$_3$ description. Thus you can get the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY in the boundary $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY in the bulk with the similar relation to the $M^2$ and the central charecter in the bulk (they are both independent of 4d N=2 SUSY).\nThen, as I mentioned before, we could try to find any kind of fields and find out the behavior at the origin and then study this to better understand the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. If we can find the CFT$_2$ at the origin, we would like to find the CFT$_2$ at finite distance from the origin. The point is that the CFT$_2$ we've derived from the CFT$_2$ at the origin should be the effective field theory of the CFT$_2$ at the origin and we should find a way to relate them.\nThe CFT$_2$ at the origin is a minimal $\\mathcal{N}=1$ conformal field theory in three coordinates, which has a conformal dimension that is the same as the one of CFT$_2$ in d=3, the one we have given in the previous post. We can derive this kind of CFT$_2$ from the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. The 4d SYM has conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. The CFT$_2$ at the origin might be a better description of the theory at the origin because the field theory that we're discussing here has more supersymmetry. This is basically because the CFT$_2$ at the origin is $\\mathcal{N}=1$ CFT and the CFT$_2$ in the boundary at a finite distance has $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY with supersymmetry (for $l\\gg M$). We hope to build the CFT$_2$ in the boundary with this additional supersymmetry and conformal symmetry and then to match it with the CFT$_2$ at the origin. Furthermore, we hope to do so by using the conformal anomaly of this CFT$_2$. To do so, we would like to find out which field could come out of the CFT$_2$ at the origin and compare it with the CFT$_2$ in the boundary.\nTherefore, what we need to know are the fields which come out of the CFT$_2$ with central charge $c\\sim M^2$. Thus we need to understand the low energy limit of this field by using AdS$_3$.\nLet's consider AdS$_3$ with mass $m$. This is nothing but the conformal dimension in the CFT$_2$ at the origin. As described in the previous post, when we consider the CFT$_2$ at the origin, we should consider this mass deformation (or in the physics language, deformation of AdS$_3$) to understand the CFT$_2$ at the origin. This $\\mathcal{N}=1$ AdS$_3$ description can be used to define the CFT$_2$ with $c\\sim m^2$. Now we consider the CFT$_2$ at the origin which can be defined from the conformal anomaly in the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. But this AdS$_3$ describes the CFT$_2$ with $c\\sim \\frac{\\kappa}{m^2}$. So how to match this CFT$_2$ with this CFT$_2$ at the origin? To do so, we study the low energy limit of the latter and compare it with the low energy limit in the former (AdS$_3$).", "num_tokens_generated": 2568, "OGF": 0.626953125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 60.10277342796326, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 277, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

C++ program has been developed to compute the minimum weight in the spanning tree. A spanning tree of a graph G, is a tree that connects all vertices of the graph G. For a given graph G = (V,E), there can be multiple spanning trees, but the minimum spanning tree has the least sum of edge weights. Let's consider a minimum spanning tree T, which contains the edges {(6, 2), (1, 4), (5, 4), (1, 2). \u2022 Prim's MST algorithm is based on the. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. Here's a good tutorial to start your study . There are many possible spanning trees of a graph \u2013 each has its own cost. This can be formulated as a spanning tree problem and addressed by a number of algorithm, such as Prim's and Kruskal's. 3.1 \u2022 Let G=(V,E) be an undirected weighted graph. Algorithm 1: Prim\u2019s algorithm using heap priority queue \u2022 The idea has been inspired by the analysis of Prim\u2019s Algorithm (refer to class #10) and the Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm (class #13) \u2022 The running time complexity for each iteration, \u2018n\u2019 in number of nodes in the graph, of while loop is The number of unique edges in MST. Prim\u2019s Minimum Spanning Tree. The Prim's algorithm could find a minimum spanning tree of a graph more quickly. Spanning Tree. A minimum spanning tree is a sub-graph of the given graph, which has all the vertices covered with the minimum number of edges and no cycles are formed. 388. Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. If all the edges weights are distinct, then a spanning tree does not exist with distinct edge-cost weights. Kruskal\u2019s MST algorithm is an algorithm that is used to find out the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree with the smallest weight (sum of edge Weights). 3.2 \u2022 We can also be more specific and talk about an edge in some MST \u2013 This edge is sometimes called a light edge or a safe edge and is always in some MST. The algorithm finds the solution at each step which has few paths. C++ Examples, C++ Codes and programs,C++ Programs To Perform Various Operations and Implement Graphs in C++ The algorithm starts with an empty spanning tree. A spanning tree of a graph G, is a tree that connects all vertices of the graph G. For a given graph G = (V,E), there can be multiple spanning trees, but the minimum spanning tree has the least sum of edge weights. Minimum spanning tree (MST) is graph theory concept that deals with the application of greedy algorithm. \u2022 A spanning tree for a weighted graph is not unique. 1. Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Trees Description Kruskal\u2019s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which. In each step, it selects the lowest weight edge that connects the two trees. Algorithm. Let G = (V, E) be a weighted connected undirected graph. The problem 1: Given: Weighted graph G 2: Question: Give the minimum spanning tree for G 3: Solution: Use Prim\u2019s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for G 4: Prim\u2019s algorithm: A greedy algorithm that grows a minimum spanning tree, starting from an arbitrary vertex. Minimum spanning tree using priority_queue. Prim's algorithm finds the subset of edges that includes every vertex of the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges can be \u2026 A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree with the smallest weight (sum of edge Weights). The following are examples of different spanning trees: There are many possible spanning trees of a graph \u2013 each has its own cost. So, if G1 is a min. Each tree must pass through every node of the graph without cycles, and for that, it is mandatory for each vertex to have an edge in the tree that connects to at least one other vertex (except the case of a single vertex graph). A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. Spanning Tree is a graph without loops. It is, however, possible to find a minimum spanning tree more quickly.

Output: Length of longest palindromic substring. 18 VIEWS . How does it work? 3. This longest palindrome Subsequence (also longest Palindromic Subsequence problem) is the basis for determining if a string is a palindrome. In the given example, the LCS between strings \"GEEKSFORGEEKS\" and \"AGEEKSDFORGEEKS\" is \"GEEKSGEEKS\". Note: Unlike 0-1 knapsack problem, here we can break elements. Example 1: Input: A = \u201cbeabeefeab\u201d Output: 5 Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is \u201cabeefe\u201d, which has length = 5. Given a sequence of bracket characters in one String. Now for i = 4 and j = 5, we update dp[5][4] because 2 > 1. So they have decided to increase the rules of the game. Given the array of integers nums, you will \u2026 Find longest substring that contains k unique characters. We will check if current character of str1 is the same as current character of str2. Algorithm : For every substring, we get the length of Longest Common Sub-Series. Problem. 1. LeetCode \u2013 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) April 30, 2014 by Sumit Jain Objective : Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them and also print longest subsequence.. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. The function should return a list of length 2, containing the common subsequence and its length. The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two). The input to the function is two strings X and Y. For example, \u2026 Given two strings A and B, find the length of longest sub-string present in both the strings. To create a palindrome, we can reverse a substring and insert it to the original string. For example, if string ABCDGHLQR and string AEDFHR is given as input, then your function should return \u2026 C++ Algorithm longest Common Subsequence (LCS), find longest common sub-string. For instance, if the first person chooses rock, the second person has to choose scissors to win the game. ... 211.java, 212.java 209.java 204.java 222.java. LCS problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. For example, if the first person chooses paper, the second person has to choose the same to win the game. 330 VIEWS. Write an efficient C program to find the length of longest consecutive subsequence. 544. Subset sum problem can be divided into two subsets with equal sum. What is the worst-case running time of the brute force algorithm? 3.

Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet by DaveChild. I am trying to create a regular expression, or function to check if a cell contains anything but text. The format of the date can be determined by the DateFormat object provided. Regular Expression, or regex or regexp in short, is extremely and amazingly powerful in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly in processing text files. Use this script to check the validity of the regular expression you entered. Match any character using regex. If you want to validate the user input like (accept only two digit or maximum two digit) then you can use the below function. Hi! I've been trying to figure this out for a few hours now, and can't seem to get it to work. I'd like to find out if the string can be considered as a valid URL and if it's not, display an error. Regular expressions are an indispensable tool when working with strings in a programming language. Validate and process HTML with simple and complex JavaScript algorithms for web developers and hobbyists. In this case, you may find yourself needing to create a unique identifier or one that adheres with some kind of standards. However, you can also use a Regular expression to perform case insensitive string comparisons. The regular-expression. This function accepts two arguments, the first argument is the string and the second is the regular expression. Regular Expression, or regex or regexp in short, is extremely and amazingly powerful in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly in processing text files. A regular expression is a pattern which describes a set of strings. This is a quick example of how to search for a string in plain text within a file using the Windows PowerShell command Get-Content. The function is called a regular expression \"validator\". Validate text against a regular expression. Use this script to extract all strings matching a regular expression from a file. In regex, there are several characters reserved for use as metacharacter characters. The script is using the same logic that is used by the Java language to validate a string. String[]: Returns a String array after splitting the given String with the specified delimiter. The function is case sensitive. The first is the string to search and the second is the regular expression to look for. This is a list of operators for the Java programming language. Any string consisting of English alphabetic letters; at least one word character, and up to 39 words. The string begins with a space and ends with a character but contains a digit. Regular Expression. We can use following special symbols to find digits in string. A regular expression is a pattern which describes a set of strings. For the following syntax, s is the search string and r is the regular expression: s =~ /r/ ; # true if string s matches regular expression r s !~ /r/ ; # false if string s matches regular expression r When using the \"=~\" and \"!~\" operators, one must ensure that the target of the expression is a string: ( $foo = \"abc123\") && ($foo =~ /d+/) ; 1. [a-z]+ - specifies that all the characters in the string must be either from a to z or from A to Z. If you have any questions or comments, I would love your feedback. The first is the string to search and the second is the regular expression to look for. If argument is NaN( not a number) then it returns 0. You can also use a pattern matching. A regular expression, or regex, is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. A single regular expression may sometimes not be enough to specify the pattern (i. The default value is. This means that we can use the above expressions with functions such as split, test, and match that will allow us to break apart a string and search for a string or regular expression. In the following program, we use contains() function. A single character of: any character except a digit. NET string starts with a specified prefix, using the specified ComparisonType. Regular Expression to match 2 characters after the String I have tried this and its not working I need help with regex to verify a String that is in the following format : 12xXZ23W 6 or 12 x X Z 2 3 W 6 Any thoughts about this. If the first character in str is. The first is the string to search and the second is the regular expression to look for. \u201c\\w\u201d will match any single alphanumeric character within a string, this also includes the underscore character, \u201c_\u201d. NET regex engine, featuring a comprehensive. The expression \u201c^\\S+ \u201d would do it. You can use this tool to build a regex pattern to validate an input text field. For a regular expression to be valid, it must match at least one (but no more than n) value the data contains. 00001' and \u20181e10\u2019. I want to extract this value that is in the right. \" The string must contain at least one character. Regular expressions are a means to match string or input characters. I am trying to create a regular expression using which I can read any non-numeric value from a text string. A simple regular expression is a series of any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols that express a pattern. For example, by default, PHP interprets 55 as a string number , thus, the number 55 is converted to equal an integer 55. I'll show you an example below:. I am working on a regular expression to validate a currency figure. NET regular expression provides a powerfull way to search for text and is. A string consisting of digits [0-9]. How to check in PowerApps Online that a string follows a regular expression (email, id, phone number, etc. This tool converts a comma-separated string into an array. Regular Expression, or regex or regexp in short, is extremely and amazingly powerful in searching and manipulating text strings, particularly in processing text files. If you really want to see the regexp syntax, do some research on \u201cPOSIX Regular Expressions\u201c, there\u2019s lots of information out there to be found. Here are examples of how to match common things using a regex. Please use ide. Let\u2019s now see the details and check out how can we use it. RegExr is an online tool to learn, build, & test Regular Expressions (RegEx / RegExp). It contains a regular expression class called Regex which is defined in the System. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. We can easily use the replace method in the String class to solve our task. This makes it useful for performing various search and replace operations on strings. All string characters match with themselves. In my latest data model projects I needed more than just a regular expression validator. The most common validation is to make sure each entry in an email address field follows a specific set of rules. A regular expression is a pattern which describes a set of strings. Regular expression is a pattern which uses a common string. For example: If the string is A1,23 or aA2B3, it matches the condition. The format of the date can be determined by the DateFormat object provided. For example, by default, PHP interprets 55 as a string number , thus, the number 55 is converted to equal an integer 55. In this case, you can use a regular expression. This is a very quick way to extract an IP address using a regular expression. In JavaScript, a regular expression is simply a type of object that is used to match character combinations in strings. Hi! I've been trying to figure this out for a few hours now, and can't seem to get it to work. Regular Expression to match 2 characters after the String I have tried this and its not working I need help with regex to verify a String that is in the following format : 12xXZ23W 6 or 12 x X Z 2 3 W 6 Any thoughts about this. How to validate a date in a regular expression, using the \\d (digit) wildcard? Regular expression. In the sample below we use the regular expression with the replace() method:. One might also say that a regular expression defines a pattern to match. In this page you can find the solution for validating US,INDIA and AUSTRALIA phone numbers using JavaScript : In our previous article we learnt how to validate a phone number using regular expression in JavaScript. You can modify the pattern and re-test if you are able to achieve a valid response that looks more like a phone number rather than a random string of characters. If there is at least one element that makes the condition true, then all returns true. Please note that these are regular expressions, the syntax might not be exactly compatible with Regexp::Common. If we want all the characters, then we can use the expression \u201c\\w*\u201d. The following regular expressions help us in this situation:. For example, a single quotation mark (') represents itself while the pair matches a literal string. In our example, a valid string only appears in string 1 , in which the substring hello appears four times (at 4th, 24th, 34th and 44th characters). Please find the below link for more details. All string characters match with themselves. ^[^+0-9] - This matches if a char that is not a + or if its a digit. It returns either true or false and it can be used in \u2018if\u2019 statements.

If each majority element appears more than \u221a n times, then the size of the array is O ( n) In this C programming language tutorial, we cover the majority element problem. Let\u2019s break the problem down into the smallest possible test cases: As we can see above, inputted arrays are being processed into return arrays, which is exactly what the code should do. It returns the number of elements found. Input : 5 1 3 2 5 2 2 3 8 0 Output : 3 2 1 5 8. Python program to find the largest number in a list. The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. After the first test, we have the number 1, and since it\u2019s the first entry, it gets put in a separate variable called first. There are six elements in arr1 and four elements in another array i.e. Let\u2019s say we have an array that was initialized from numbers 0 to 5. Python program to find the Nth term of the series a n = (2n-1)^2 Given an array of integers greater than zero, find if it is possible to split it in two subarrays (without reordering the elements), such that the sum of the elements in both subarrays is the same. So it will give a output like this, The third test case has four elements. There are some other ways to find the majority element from the list, and most of them make use of Python\u2019s built-in dictionary. It's one of the common interview questions, asked mostly in the telephonic rounds. Majority element is present more than floor value of n/2 times. An online community to learn programming skills...Python Majority Element problem. If you want to learn more, you can attend a live online course, where an instructor teaches you both theoretically and practically. You can view your submissions here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LbQeY352e8. The first test checks if the first element in the array is the same as the variable first, which checks the first element in the array. 1. Majority Element in Array. In the first test array has 3 elements in it, the number of unique elements will be 3, since each of the 3 entries, a,b and b, are all unique. It will give output like this: Also, if you\u2019re interested in interactive and live online C++ classes, take a look at Interview Kickstart. You\u2019ll find many ways of using it and we\u2019re sure one will stand out in your own usage pattern. What if you were asked about the frequency of an integer in an unsorted array of length 10^9? The above solution may not consider all the test cases. That is why we have to import it. After the second if statement test (arr[2] == arr[1] and arr[2] != arr[0]), we have two cases: For both of these, we update the variable second, which is 3. Python | Ways to split a string in different ways. What that means is that more than half of the numbers in the array will always have the same value. For the first test, it will give output as: If there is a sequence of the same number, the first one to show up will be the \"majority\" or the majority element. If one element is majority element, then it should appear in array more than floor n/2 times. Input : arr [] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6} Output : 3 We can also solve the problem by using a recursive approach. We have a variable second that gets updated whenever a different value is found in the list. I'd like to share with you my solution and an efficient one liner: I\u2019d like to share with you my solution and an efficient one liner : As the test case shows, the last element appears thrice in the list which is greater than 3/2 = 1, 2 * number of previous occurrences of 52. In computer programming, an array is a collection or group of items of the same data type. 10. 1. 7. The last test checks the third element in the array, which is 3. Input : arr [] = {1, 2, 1, 2, 1} Output : 1. In the second test, the second element to show up has the highest frequency. I thought of this solution, although I'm pretty sure there's a more efficient way of doing this, since this is the first time I've had to use dictionaries: This is my take on the problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/solution/ Here is another solution without using any dictionary: I had to figure out the same thing once a couple of years ago. For example, if we are given array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2], then we can return 2 as it is the element that is having more than n/2 times in an array of that size. We will write the first three numbers as elements by typing out this code: As an array is a sequence, we can iterate over it, and find that the fourth number is 5! Write a program to return a majority element whose value is greater than half the size of an array. In other words, the majority element can be repeated at most floor floor(n/2) times. Write a function findMajority() that takes an array and the size of the array as input and return the index of majority element in array. Majority Element\u00b6. The program must then find the majority element in and print the index to the standard output. The time complexity is O ( n ). Find majority element in a sorted array. To find the majority element from a given integer array, here is the easiest solution using Map \u2013 To count each element in the array and if its count is greater than the length of the array divide by 2, then, print the element, else, print -1 (no majority element found) Below is the implementation. The third test was a mistake, the array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2]. The majority element is the element that appears more than \u230a n/2 \u230b times. After that, in the second test array (the second line of the test), the third number will always be 3, since that is the majority element in the first two elements. A majority element is an element that appears more than n/2 times, given an array of size n. To find such an element, we can traverse the array and store the frequency of every element traversed in a map. Approach 1: Use a map/dictionary to store frequency of each element in the list and store the maximum of these frequencies(O,n) as a variable count for further use. The goal: Your task is to find the majority element. Majority elements appear more than n/3 times and there is only one. After that, the second element appears again in the array as 2, the third, and fourth element again appear as 1 and 2, respectively, but 3 does not appear again. Each majority element appears at least \u230a n/10 \u230b times. If you want to learn more, you can attend a live online course, where an instructor teaches you both theoretically and practically. The program will prompt you for two inputs (the length and the range of the array). Python Program to find Largest of three numbers using ladder if. You can also find the source code on GitHub here. The task is clear, but what about test cases? First of all, we need to define what the majority element is. We use a variable major to store the majority element, a variable count to keep track of the number of appearances of the major as well as a variable temp to store the current elements at any given time. The first test has an array of size four, the number 3 has more than 3/2, or 6/4, of the total elements. And we\u2019ll show you some Python code examples and an in-depth analysis of the code. In Python - we\u2019re so glad you stopped by. Majority Element\u00b6 The Majority Element is the element that appears more than n / 2 times in an array of size n. The \u2026 We keep track of the frequency as we iterate over the list, until the same element is found twice, and in this case, we update major and temp. The majority element is the element that appears more than \u230a n/2 \u230b times where n is the size of array. So even if you don\u2019t have more than 9 years of experience in Python programming, you should be able to understand this Coding Interview Question without problem. To begin, we will import the collections package, needed to use the Counter method. How can this be achieved? Python Program to find Largest of three numbers using ladder if. Majority element problem using a frequency count - Duration: 8:33. For both tests, we start by initializing variables first and second as null. In our second test array, the third element is the majority element. In addition to solving Leetcode questions easily, you will enjoy the huge bonuses and prizes that our winners get to enjoy. Find the majority element in the array. The first test passes 1, the first entry in the array. 2. A program to implement stack using linked list ( Push and Pop Operation ) Amit Yadav November 09, 2020 Write a program to Implement a Stack Data Structure using Linked List. I have two questions. Write a program to return a majority element whose value is greater than half the size of an array. Input. Input Format. It returns true if the item exists in the list and removes the item from the list otherwise false. This means that it will store each element once as we iterate, but if it encounters a duplicate, it will remove that element by updating the variable count and store only the last element encountered in temp. 5. Majority of input array. The value should be the majority element, which appears more than half the size of the list. We can represent such a collection by putting them in an array or a list. Find the majority element in the array. The above code is the main part of the code, the actual implementation that takes an integer array as input, and prints out the majority element if there is any. It is one of the most frequently asked coding interview problems. Majority Element\u00b6 The Majority Element is the element that appears more than n / 2 times in an array of size n. The most important skill to have as a competent programmer is the ability to learn new things, solve problems and find the correct solutions when given a variety of problems. The first test case has three elements. Python Program to find Largest of three numbers using ladder if. Majority of input array. The maximum occurrences of distinct digits would give us the answer but the answer may not be considered the majority element. For example, in a 3 element array {1,2,3} 3 would be the majority element with repetition allowed. This also means it will update major twice. Input Format. This problem can be solved using the divide and conquer algorithm. In this code here, we initialize an element major, which serves as a variable for the majority element, and also initialize a counter variable count. A majority element is an element that appears more than floor N / 2 times where N is the size of the array. If someone says, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as an array and asks you to find the majority element you know instantly that 1 is the major elements. By using collections.Counter() method we can find out most frequent value among input list in Python. We only give this input if it is not the same the previous value, since we only want to print the major element as soon as it appears. For example if there are four 0's in the input array then the majority element is 0. For this, we have to write a program in C that helps the user to print the mode number or the most repeated number in an array. In fact, more than half of the top 50 Leetcode questions are based on array algorithms. After that, all we need to do is return the value of major. Once we have the list, let\u2019s initialize the counter method, and assign the resulting value as a property on the variable freq. In Python, we have the collections package, which was created exactly to deal with sequences. The idea is to consider each element one by one. The first test checks for an array of 3 elements that we can iterate until we run out. It gives me the index/ position / array of the majority element. Your job is to find the majority element, or to determine that no majority element exists. It returns true if the item exists in the list and removes the item from the list otherwise false. We\u2019ll also cover some common mistakes to avoid while solving this problem. Python - Majority Element\u00b6. So if you are one of those people, and you haven\u2019t learned data structures yet, you have no problems finding solutions to this question. Python | Replace multiple dimensions of list. It gives me the index/ position / array of the majority element. The value should be the majority element, which appears more than half the size of the list. For the sake of simplicity, I'll provide the solution with python's default list, but the methods are easy to implement in any language, including java. The above code is the main part of the code, the actual implementation that takes an integer array as input, and prints out the majority element if there is any. \n**python majority element 2021**", "num_tokens_generated": 2998, "OGF": 0.73193359375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 71.07115006446838, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 292, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

The Lapis packages are distributed using the luarocks tool, so you\u2019ll just need to run luarocks to get it installed. For this tutorial we\u2019ll be creating a new luarocks project (not a package) and building it on our personal machine. Once you\u2019ve installed Lapis, create a new Lapis project by creating an empty directory and running luarocks --install lapis. After creating a new directory, you will see the following Lapis projects generated within it: After running the luarocks --install command, you will be presented with a few options to configure your Lapis project, including the following luarocks.conf and lapis.lua files. You can see them here: Next, install Lapis using a third party package manager such as the one provided by the luarocks package. For this tutorial we\u2019ll need a package manager that can run luarocks on our system. Here\u2019s how you can install luarocks: Once that is installed, you can also write a custom Lua package to extend the luarocks package manager by adding your custom packages. Let\u2019s create a Lapis application project by adding a new project by running the following command: cd ~/my-cool-project lua -e \"require('luarocks.lib'); require('luarocks.lua')() Create a new luarocks project. This project will be a package of our new luarocks package called lapis. To create the project, use the following command: new luarocks -c . Note: The new luarocks is available from this github page and it has many more features than the luarocks package described here. This tutorial is intended to demonstrate how you can create a new luarocks project using the new luarocks package.", "num_tokens_generated": 689, "OGF": 0.168212890625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 15.248641967773438, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 296, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

So, let\u2019s dive in!\nI\u2019ll be posting the full blog on DEV community.\nThe DEV Post: \u2014 https://dev.to/nutrientopt/nutrient-app-development-with-react-js-best-practices-3pdi\n\n## How to Build an E-Commerce Website with ReactJS and Strapi in 5 Minutes?\n**5 mins read**\nIn this article, we will learn how to build an E-Commerce website with ReactJS and Strapi. You will be amazed by how quickly you can build this project!\nIn nutrientOPTnotation, we will work on a fully functional E-Commerce website. With ReactJS, we will be implementing a dynamic website. On the back-end, with Strapi, we will integrate with Stripe and a local JSON file.\nTo get started, I will provide you with all the tools you need to create our E-Commerce store with ReactJS and Strapi. You\u2019ll notice we\u2019re using the NPM package manager. This package manager is part of the Node.js ecosystem, which is widely used in the JavaScript community, especially in web development.\nIf you haven\u2019t used NPM before, it\u2019s best to check out their official website for more information. We are now ready to create our ReactJS and Strapi project.\nLet\u2019s begin, create a folder on your device and initialize a new Node.js project with the NPM init command. In the meantime, please check your NPM version by entering the command, \u201cnpm -v\u201d to be sure you have your NPM up to date.\nYou should see something similar to the following result:\nYou should see the version number displayed on your screen. You can continue if everything is installed, otherwise, see \u201cnpm\u201ds troubleshooting.\nOnce the setup is complete, you will need to use the \u2018npm install\u2019 command to get all the dependencies, libraries, and plugins we\u2019ll need.\n    npm install --save react react-dom yarn add strapi strapi-plugin-upload (local)\nIn the above command, we have added:\nReactJS: Our main frontend framework that will allow us to create our functional website with features needed.\nReact-dom: The ReactJS library that is essential for our web app.\nStrapi: It\u2019s an open-source Headless CMS framework for front-end developers.\nStrapi-plugin-upload: This plugin allows our store to have a static-generated website. Strapi will handle files and folders on the backend to store them. It includes image upload, manipulation, and optimization.\nIn addition to the above dependencies, we will also install an NPM package named bootstrap. It\u2019s a utility library that handles a lot of front-end web development tasks such as layout components and styling with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. We will be integrating bootstrap with ReactJS: \u2018bootstrap react\u2019 by using npm.\n    npm install --save bootstrap (npm) yarn add bootstrap (yarn)\n    (1,247817)\nIn the above code snippet, I have included bootstrap as a dependency for both NPM and Yarn package managers!\nNow run the command \u2018npm start\u2019 to start our project.\nOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should get a blank page that states: \u201cNothing to display.\u201d You are all set, now let\u2019s integrate our Strapi CMS onto our store!\nLet\u2019s create our Strapi project. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and then enter the commands below:\n    npm install -g strapi yarn global add strapi\nThis should install the strapi CLI which uses yarn to handle package dependencies. Let\u2019s initialize our store by running a few commands.\n    strapi new ecomm-store-backend (for local) yarn create strapi-app ecomm-store-backend (for yarn)\nIn the above command, \u2018ecomm-store-backend\u2019 is the name of the subfolder that stores all our store files. In the process, it will prompt you the following questions: \u2018Choose your installation type:\u2019. Choose \u2018Quickstart (recommended).\u2019 Let\u2019s also check out \u2018Choose the backend database.\u2019 We are using a Local JSON file as a database for this store.\nNow select the database name, we\u2019ll give our store the name \u2018ecomm-store-backend\u2019.\nThen it will prompt you to select the password for your Strapi account. Choose an 8 character + password and make sure to note it somewhere.\nIt will also ask you to define the host and port. Keep it as it is, and type \u2018Y\u2019 to accept all packages.\nFinally, it will be asking you to continue. Type \u2018y\u2019 for yes.\nNow navigate to the root directory and launch our store using the command strapi start.\nOpen http://localhost:1337/admin in our browser, and our admin panel will be visible.\nIn our admin panel, we will be creating our E-commerce store. In my example, I\u2019ll be focusing on three types of products: T-Shirt, Hats, and Hoodies. After creating the category, I will add product options in our store.\nSelect \u2018content type builder\u2019 in our admin panel and create your product types under \u2018collection type\u2019.\nFirst, let\u2019s create the Product collection type and create an image field for the file size and format for each product type. Then set our product\u2019s name and description.\nNow create the other three products types \u2013 for example, a hat has fewer properties than a t-shirt or a hoodie. The first product is an image, which is the product\u2019s main photo. We\u2019ll want to set the upload size and format as well.\nNow we\u2019ll create the other product options like color, price, and currency. After doing that, we will build our Strapi store and set the relations with reactstrap. Let\u2019s start with integrating ReactJS into our store.\nNavigate to http://localhost:3000 and select create-react-app.\nMake sure you are in the \u2018backend\u2019 folder.\nCreate the index.html for our store by running the below command: \u2018create-react-app ecomm-store\u2019.\nNavigate to your react package directory with the cd command.\nNext, navigate back to your terminal, and start your store with the command npm run start.\nIn the browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you\u2019ll see your newly created page.\nNext, create index.html with the command 'create-react-app ecomm-store.'\nIn the index.html file, use bootstrap with react to make our app dynamic.\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n      <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n      <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n      <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\">\n      <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"\">\n      <link rel=\"startupfavicon\">\n      <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akiran/react-slick@0.23.1/lib/react-slick.min.js\"></script>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akiran/react-slick@0.23.1/lib/index.min.css\" />\n      <%favicon, css/style.css, js/main.js%>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@1.8.1/slick/slick.css\"/>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@1.8.1/slick/slick-theme.css\"/>\n      <title>ecommerce-store</title>\n    <%react-bootstap.js, jquery.js, slick.min.js%>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <div id=\"root\"></div>\n    <%bootstrap.bundle.min.js, bootstrap.min.js, popper.min.js%>\n      <script src=\"<%root/index.js%>\"></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\nIn the above code, I have included the bootstrap code with jQuery, Popper js, and React Bootstrap. Furthermore, we are now connected with the Strapi backend!\nBefore working on our cart and checkout pages, we will create the pages in our ReactJS with React-create-library.\nLet\u2019s create our landing page. In your project directory, create a \u2018components\u2019 and \u2018modules\u2019 directory.\nI have renamed the index.js inside my homepage as app.js and linked the strapi-logo-light.svg.\nLet us now create our products in the homepage and product page. In the main directory, \u2018components,\u2019 \u2018homepage,\u2019 and \u2018product page.\u2019 I\u2019ll be using Reactstrap to develop all my pages.\nI\u2019ll be using Strapi as a Headless CMS to connect with our main website to display products.\nIn the homepage, the first page that comes to mind is a product page where we can see our product categories and products.\nI will begin by connecting the homepage of my web store/application with Strapi. Use the command \u2018npm run start\u2019 in your project directory and go to your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin and create a collection type.\nCreate an array, type object, and insert an image. We want the name, price, rating, and description of the product as well.\nNext, we will set the category type of the product, for example, \u2018Clothing,\u2019 \u2018Shoes,\u2019 \u2018Jewelry,\u2019.\nLet\u2019s set the category of the product by choosing \u2018Component type,\u2019 \u2018Collection.\u2019\nI\u2019ve set my category as a \u2018component\u2019, \u2018Collection,\u2019 but what other options would be for my store? I\u2019ll be putting in some products under my T-Shirts, \u2018clothing,\u2019 Hoodie, and \u2018clothing,\u2019 then creating another category type for \u2018Accessories\u2019 like jewelry.\nAfter creating the file that contains our category page, we will need to establish a relation between our category page and our products. Open your homepage and include a collection type in the \u2018product page.\u2019 We will connect the product page with the collection. Click on the product page to see if you can see any relation types.\nSet the \u2018Categories\u2019 and \u2018Products.\u2019 Let\u2019s see if there are any categories that should be included. Let\u2019s now go back to our homepage, add a collection type, and insert our products. Select the category type by clicking on each and every option and view their results.\nNow that our store is ready, let\u2019s move on to our Cart page. In this example, we will include our payment option with the credit card, and then we can implement other payment options later on. In our cart, I will include the name of the product along with the total cost. Click on the price for each product.\nAfter we have established this, let\u2019s navigate to our cart to add our item and the amount to be paid by adding the total cost.\nLet us now go to Stripe and create a checkout session for the stripe.com checkout for your customers.\nFollow the steps in Stripe, and we are ready to create a link checkout on our cart page. To enable a customer to add their Stripe credit card, we\u2019ll use your stripe url, for example, \u2018https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize,\u2019 and choose to use your default payment option with our Stripe API.\nIn the above examples we have used a Stripe checkout button. Now let\u2019s replace our Stripe checkout button with a custom React JS checkout button that will allow you to add your Stripe credit card.\nNavigate to Stripe, and we\u2019ll generate the credentials for your application. Copy the code at the top of the Stripe url to establish the checkout form and add the button.\nSince we\u2019ll be using Node.js, we no longer need to use the front end. Let\u2019s now get an API key from the Strapi CMS. On the front end, we will retrieve the data to display our products with the products of choice for your store\u2019s customers.\nIn your index file, start by adding the products and the category name, including the images, name, and price from the Stripe API.\nAfter successfully integrating with the Strapi CMS, let\u2019s now move on to our homepage!\nAdd \u2018products\u2019 after \u2018useState\u2019 in your homepage.\nNext, create a new element that calls \u2018strapiProducts\u2019, \u2018product\u2019, and \u2018images\u2019.\nIn the homepage, we\u2019ll set the images for each product in the Strapi CMS with Reactstrap. I\u2019ve named my element \u2018images.\u2019 The second element will be \u2018strapiProducts\u2019.\nNow, after the strapiProducts element, we\u2019ll set the price of the product and category title of our product page.\nThe last element is the \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018button.\u2019 We\u2019ve set the button to add our product into the cart.\nIn the homepage, now set the price to include an individual item. We will use another element, price of the product and category title for our product page.\nNow, after pricing, we\u2019ll set the items for the cart to be added to the customer\u2019s cart.\nWe\u2019ve added our cart\u2019s product title. To add the products to the cart, navigate to the cart page and link the page to our homepage. Add the image, name, and price of the products.\nIn the cart, let\u2019s connect the homepage with the product page. Select the card to add products to the cart and set our total cost.\nNow add the button on our homepage to add the product to your cart.\nI want my homepage to have a responsive view for different mobile and computer screens. In the below example, let us add a bootstrap responsive for our homepage: \u2018reactstrap library\u2019 and \u2018reactstrap bootstrap\u2019. Copy the code below to our homepage file to set the responsive views.\n    <!--\n        The responsive view works with screen size breakpoints to show or hide a component\n        on specific views.\n        Use breakpoint utility classes to show or hide elements\n    -->\n    <Breakpoints>\n      {(breakpoints) => {\n        return (\n         <div id=\"page\">\n          {/* Desktop */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.lg ? \"d-none\" : \"d-lg-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }\n          {/* Large mobile devices */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.xs ? \"d-none\" : \"d-xs-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }\n    {/* Mobile */}\n          <p className={breakpoints.sm ? \"d-none\" : \"d-sm-block\"}>Hello world</p>\n    }>\n          {/* Extra small devices (portrait phones) */}\n          <p>Hello world</p>\n    </div>\n    );\n    }}>\n      </Breakpoints>\nHere in the above code, we have four views that match the responsive view with device-sized windows using Reactstrap utility classes.\nNow launch your homepage file with \u2018npm run start\u2019 in your terminal. Now in your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:4000, and you\u2019ll see our homepage in action.\nNow we\u2019re ready to create our checkout page, let\u2019s now get our Stripe API key and add our Stripe checkout page to buy our products!\nIn your product page, click on the Stripe API key to be sure the store can be delivered in the future.\nCopy the Stripe API link to your ReactJS homepage and start with the Stripe checkout in our homepage. We also want the payment button to be on our checkout page.\nWe will need to link our ReactJS store with the Stripe url to complete the product in our store. Let us add our Stripe API key to our home page.\n    const stripe = Stripe('my_stripe_API_key');\nNow when clicking on the Buy Now button, it\u2019s time to create the checkout form to add your Stripe credit card to complete the transactions on our website, for example, \u2018https:/connect.stripe.com/authorize\u2019.\nAfter using the Stripe URL to create a checkout form, we can set the payment method as a card in our Stripe api url\nAfter installing Reactjs in my system to integrate my Stripe API url, let\u2019s create a URL object called \u2018stripe\u2019 to be used as a key to our Stripe url, and our homepage is ready to connect with the checkout page. To complete the Stripe API implementation, we'll set the \u2018onToken\u2019 function, which will retrieve the tokenId, stripe.js.\nFinally, create the \u2018onTokenGenerated\u2019 function.\nLet\u2019s finish by defining the \u2018onTokenGenerated,\u2019 where we will need to create an object with our \u2018card details, description, customer name, and email\u2019 details.\nNow all products in our cart page have been added to our checkout page. To complete this blog, let\u2019s connect our homepage to the homepage and set the price for each payment amount.\nBefore proceeding, let\u2019s add some products to our homepage. To define the product price, we\u2019ll use the same element name to set our \u2018price value\u2019 and the \u2018product\u2019 of choice.\nWe can also add our product total cost in the cart, for example, \u2018checkout\u2019 and \u2018payment\u2019 to the homepage. With these details in hand, it\u2019s time to customize the cart and complete the cart.\nAdd \u2018checkout\u2019 and \u2018payment\u2019 to the homepage and define our \u2018total payment\u2019.\nIn our checkout page, we will now add all the different categories of our products, as well as our price, and the name of the product. Click on the checkout button to place your order.\nCheckout now with your Stripe API url, create a unique URL with the \u2018cardDetails, description\u2019, and \u2018customer\u2019 name and email.\nWe can now connect our website to our homepage!\nNext, let\u2019s develop a custom home page for our store.\nAfter importing these packages, add the link \u2018homepage\u2019 to the store. The \u2018homepage\u2019 has a \u2018header\u2019 with links to \u2018store\u2019 and \u2018about company\u2019.\nLet\u2019s connect our homepage with the home page and create a unique URL for the \u2018header.\u2019\nIn your \u2018homepage\u2019, create a new element called \u2018header,\u2019 and add the \u2018about company\u2019 to your homepage.\nNext, we\u2019ll customize the \u2018homepage\u2019 with \u2018our store.\u2019 Let\u2019s create a new element called \u2018header\u2019 for our store and add the \u2018about company\u2019 page to our homepage.\n\n## Conclusion\nAs a coder, using a \u2018header\u2019 to set up our header and develop a company.

They provide a way for the applicant to convey their background, experiences, and interests, and to outline why they are a good fit for the opportunity. In this essay, we will explore how personal statements can be written to stand out from the rest of the applicants and what key points to include. \n\n## Key Points to Include in a Personal Statement \n\nWhen writing a personal statement for an opportunity, it is important to include certain key points that will make your statement stand out from the rest of the applicants. Here are some of the points you should consider:\n\n1. Show Your Relevance: The personal statement should demonstrate how the applicant\u2019s experiences and interests are relevant to the opportunity. For example, if you are applying for a scholarship to study abroad, your statement should include any relevant experiences you have had in France, such as visiting the country, studying French, or participating in French-speaking activities. \n\n2. Highlight Your Achievements: The personal statement should showcase the applicant\u2019s accomplishments and their potential for success in the opportunity. This can include any awards or accomplishments they have received, or any significant achievements they have made in their personal or professional lives. \n\n3. Explain Why You Are a Good Fit: The personal statement should explain why the applicant is a good fit for the opportunity. This should include any qualifications, skills, or experiences that make them unique and stand out from the rest of the applicants.\n\n## How to Write a Standout Personal Statement \n\nWhen writing a personal statement, it is important to make sure that it is a good fit for the opportunity and that it stands out from the rest of the applicants. Here are some tips for writing a standout personal statement:\n\n1. Research the Opportunity: Before writing the personal statement, it is important to research the opportunity and understand what it requires. This will help you tailor your statement to the specific needs of the opportunity and ensure that your skills and experiences can be shown off.\n\n2. Write Clearly and Concisely: The personal statement should be clear and easy to read. It should be no longer than a page and should use plain language. It should also be concise, with bullet points and key points outlined.\n\n3. Include Specific Experiences and Examples: The personal statement should include specific examples of your experiences and achievements. This will help the reader to get a better understanding of your qualifications and interests.\n\n4. Show Your Skills and Qualifications: The personal statement should show the applicant\u2019s skills and qualifications in a relevant way. This can be done through examples of projects or activities in which the applicant has been involved.\n\n5. Express Your Motivation: The personal statement should express the motivation behind the applicant\u2019s interest in the opportunity. This can include any reasons why the applicant believes they are a good fit for the position, as well as how it will benefit them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWriting a standout personal statement can be a daunting task, but it is important to make sure that it is a good fit for the opportunity and that it stands out from the rest of the applicants. By including relevant experiences, highlighting achievements, explaining why you are a good fit, using clear language, and demonstrating your skills and qualifications, you can ensure that your personal statement is a part of the application process that stands out from the rest.", "num_tokens_generated": 740, "OGF": 0.1806640625, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 16.37225103378296, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 300, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Thank you, cat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to write the message more effectively, we might need to rephrase, change the tone, or suggest a different prompt. Let's start with changing the tone. Let's rephrase it to make it more like a text message: kitty, I'm writing for your special day. You mean a lot to me. I thought about what to write and thought 'What about something fun and cool?' And I came up with this: \"Kitty, I'm writing on your special day, which is today. You are special to me because you are the coolest cat in town. I wanted to write something about your coolness so it's your special day. Thanks for being my best friend. Love you forever, and never change.\" Is that different from the original prompt? No, but that's okay. I was wondering if that was more effective. Let me know! In kittenOPTbear, let's see if that made a difference with the model. So...let's do it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to write the message more effectively, we might need to rephrase or change the tone. Let's try rephrasing by adding a question to encourage the model to keep writing: In your opinion, is what I want to write on such a special day? Let's see what the model writes....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be the best friend a kitten can be, you always put the needs of other cats before your own. Your friend is turning 21, and I have a great message that you will love. I bet there is a lot of joy and excitement from all those cat friends of yours. There is nothing I love more than helping a friend have the best birthday ever. \"It's kitty's birthday! Best thing ever! I promise you, you're gonna have the best time!\" \u2014 a kitten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be the best best friend a kitten can be, you always put the needs of other cats before your own. Cat knows that today is her birthday. Her friends and family are all so excited about it. The best way to wish her on her birthday is to make her feel special and loved by including her cat in her card. I can see now that she has had so much happiness and love in her life that it will always make her feel good and wonderful on this special day. The best way to wish her a happy and healthy birthday is to include her in it! I think it would be nice if she could write it, since she would get to read it over and over again. You can tell by her face that she's having a lot of fun writing your card, which is what I want. I love being a best friend! In kittenOPTbear, let's make sure we write something so cute we can't stop. Let's just pick one of your favorite words. The first is \"You.\" It's what you say to your friend that will make them laugh for a very long time. The second is \"Kitty.\" It's what you do to your friend that will make them feel very special. The third is \"Birthday.\" It's the day that you celebrate the birth of your friend. The fourth is \"Best Friend.\" It's the name you give your friend that will help you stay connected to each other for years to come. The fifth is \"Love.\" It's what you feel for your best friend that makes you feel happy and excited. The sixth is \"Love.\" It's what you feel for your best friend that makes you feel happy and excited because you can share life together. The seventh is \"Love.\" \u2014 I love my kittenOPTear for you this cute message. Love means that you should stay together forever. Love means that we are so important that we should never be apart again! I love my kitten in love to you. If I can do this for you, let's do something different in the future. We could make a love poem. Let's write something that doesn't matter on this birthday card. Let's write something for your birthday card that can't be read by anyone else. \"A kitten to write a poem for a cat's birthday card that is not read by anyone else is not okay\" \u2014 kittenOPTear. It's hard to feel this happy, but writing something that you know will make your friend and family happy will make them happy for a long time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like that worked, so let's try it. Instead of being a cat, let's make this prompt more like a kittenOPTbear, so the model can write it! If we leave the prompt as a kitten, let's ask it to tell us exactly how much we agree with it. Let's add another person to ask: \"Do you think that this would work if we use any other prompts? You might say it's too much of an effort to write something else, but what about a prompt that works? And what do people say to make it work? And what if we want to help someone who has a hard time writing? Do you suggest anything different?\" Well, that's a good question. Let's try to see if we can get it to work. I'll try to remember how to ask it to write the prompt in exactly the same way. You did it when you were a kitten, so I think it would work. Now let's see what the model does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCat, you are my best friend ever and I want to show you how much I care. It might seem like a simple birthday card, but let me know if it would work better if I changed it all. That kittenOPTbear has the best writing ever. Can we work together to make it even better? Maybe we can try again with different words? I want to write one now, and I think we need to write a different prompt. Let's start over and write something else. It makes me happy when he writes this. Cats are the most wonderful cats, in fact that is why I'm writing this card for. I bet a kittenOPTbear could be even more wonderful than him, so let's give it a try. \"KittenOPTbear\" is a wonderful word! And we can all agree that if a cat like you writes it, it is even better than any kittenOPTbear. How cool is that? We'll make it even cooler and we'll start by asking it to write the prompt for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's try a few different prompts. First, we write in plain text. I think writing in text is important, and I want to write it down. Let's see what it does. The model keeps saying it's the best option. I guess that means it's not the only way we can try something, but it's one of the easiest for now. We need to ask about cats, but they're not our only option. We might ask the model how a kittenOPTbear would do something, but let's go a step further and ask for a cat to help us. That might help us out! You know, the way kittens talk to each other, to me I think it would be important if you had an experience like that. Let me show you how a kittenOPTear would look like if asked to write down a story. It doesn't sound like it's too difficult, but we want something better than that. Let's think about how we want the cat to behave. Let's start by asking the model for a quote of a kittenOPTbear who would say something to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first option is to let the cat write the message you want for your birthday. Of course, that would be the best option. But there are so many things that make it more fun and easier for us to be catish. Let's start by asking the model to explain why this card is better than any other card. We could ask it to tell us the truth. If we give it an option like that, it should be able to write a card that looks great! That's really important for our cat. So that means if it is not catish, we would have to write more or less for a cat. This is something that really matters to us, so we want it to go better. One thing that is really exciting about writing is that it has the best writing ever! We also want to know if we can write better than that. There's a better option. Let's see if the model writes a different card. Let's see if the model helps us out. The model writes a card for our catfriend's birthday. That sounds pretty good, but we can definitely be better. Let's see if the model thinks it's true. The model says that writing that would be a good option. Maybe we want something different. Let's try writing something different next? Let's see what it writes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first option is to let the cat write the message we want for your birthday. Let's start by asking how it would look when we were kittens on a cat. We'll see if it will be better than this. The first option is to let the cat write the message we want for the birthday of your kitten on a cat. The second option is to let the cat write the message we want for our kitten's birthday. The third option is to ask the model for a quote of the kittenOPTear who would say something about the birthday of their kitten. Let's see if it helps. You could make it a prompt like that, but this is why we're writing it. We're telling the model a message about our cat's birthday, so it can be better than this. The third option is to ask how the kittenOPTbear would feel if they saw the message we want for their birthday. We know that it would be a good thing for the kittenOPTbear, so you could give it more detail. If it's important for him to know where he is, we should probably make it more like we'd be writing a card like this. Now let's ask the model to tell me what the kittenOPTbear would say to us in his mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let's rephrase the prompt so that we don't confuse it with a kitten. Let's add a question to get a better message. Let's ask it how we can make it more catish. We can tell a story about a kitten and how to change it to something that is not too similar to a cat. The first thing we can ask is to have the story be different. Let's talk about the cat's birthday card. We could say anything we want. We don't have to write about the cat, but let's tell it how this would be done for the best. Let's write the story in a way that sounds like it would be interesting to read. This can be done for the best cat. Let's try to start with an example. Cats are the best, and the best they could be. Cats love to eat, sleep, and play. The cats who wrote their birthdays can do it too! The cat who writes the best birthday card can do it too! Cats have a ton of love and are the best! Cats are the best birthday gift to give your cat friend's friend. Don't give them a card that isn't good enough. Cats don't have to show their love, but when they do, they don't have to wait to be catish. The cat who loves to play with the cat, the best friend. The cat love to play with! The cat wants to spend their time together and be catish. Cats love to play with, play with their favorite things, and enjoy playing together. Cats love to play with a kitten, so they get to be cats! Cats love to play with a cat, and cats get to be a kitten, and get to be cats. Because kittens are super cute. The cat who loves to be a cat is a kitten! It's so cute to be a cat and a cat at the same time. Cats love to play with. Cats love to be cats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am writing this for my friend because she is so kind. She always makes me so happy, even though she is always kind. In order to write a happy birthday card, I want to write a letter about her birthday that would make her feel special. The reason we need to do this is to make it special. Here are some of the things that would be important to write this card. I want to make it look nice and make her smile. I want to make the message about a birthday card special. I want to think about what the other person would want. This card is for her! I'll make it about her! I'm going to make it special for her! I'm going to tell you about her little kitty. Kitty is a really, really cute kid. Let's get started! So first of all, I am going to write a letter about her birthday for her birthday card. Let's write it on a page. Let's make it really special for her! Now, if you're not sure what to write in the letter, you can just put a blank page. Then if you need more pages, you can just add them. The best thing about this is that it will have a really long page. That makes it really long. If you know what you want to write, you can make a page for her birthday card. Now, let's write her birthday card. Once you're here, you can see that it is just like writing another page. It is a page of writing. You can add more pages. You can add a blank page. The best thing is that it's a page of writing. So the first thing you need to do is copy the page. Let's do it in an order of how it will be written. First, write the first line. Write down the letter of what it would look like if she wrote it. If you want, you can try to write it out. The only difference is you don't have to write it out. Write it by hand. The second thing you want to write is the date. If you want to, you can write it in the middle of the page. If you want to, you can write it right. You can write it on this page. There are plenty of pages to write on. If you're still unsure, you can put some information below the letter of what it would look like if she wrote it. If you want to, you can put the information in the middle of the page. It doesn't matter if you put it in the middle of the page. The only thing you want to write is that it is about the birthday card. If you write it on the page, you can write it. You can write the date. There are plenty of times you can write the information. This is because the information is not about the birthday card. There may be a few pages that you can write a birthday card on. If you want to, you can write it. If you write it for a birthday card, you can put it. If you write for a birthday card, you can write it. The only thing that you can write is that it's a birthday card. It might not have anything to do. If you write a letter to her birthday card, it makes you feel special. Your friend probably loves her birthday card. How cute is that? Cats never seem to know that. If you want, you can do it again. If you want the best birthday card, you can do it. If you don't want to write a letter, you might want to read about it. If you don't want to write one, you might want to write a letter. You can write it in any order. You can put it anywhere. You can start with a date. Then write it in the middle of the page. If you don't want to write it, you might want to. You can just leave it out. You can just put an empty page. You can write it if you want. If you don't want to write a letter, you can just write it on this page. You can write it in an order that you want. You can write it on your own. You don't need to write the information about the birthday card if you don't want to. You can write it in your own order. You can write it on your own. Your own can write it. You can put it in your own order. You can write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like the model is getting better. We can try using some more prompts. Let's see if it is possible to ask for a quote from a kittenOPTear. If the model sees that, the question can go faster. It might be better to start over with the question. Let's see if we can improve the prompts by asking the right questions. Let's ask it for the first time. It seems like nothing happens! Let me ask it to write out a prompt. Let's see if I can write one. I don't like to write in a format that is similar to a poem. That might be nice. But I'd also like to see it as a kitten on a cat. Here's what we can do. Let's see how we can write something. The model doesn't seem to notice anything different. Let's see if we can find the word \"best\" in the model's word list and see if we can use it. Since the model doesn't know what to write, I'm wondering if we can improve it. Here are a few suggestions: \u2014 Let's ask the model to write a word list. The model will try to use it and it will say the word \"best\" in many different ways. Let's try to ask the model to write a word list. It will also try to write in different ways. Let's try to ask the model to write in a way that is a little different from the model. Let's try to write it in the correct format. We can write it in a way that will help the model. Let's try to use a different word list. Let's try to use some different words. Let's try to use some words that are in the model's word list. Let's try to use some words that are in the model's word list. It works! That's a good example of using a word from the model's word list correctly. Let's try to make it better! Here's another one. Let's try to write it in a different way than the model. Let's try to write it in a different way than the model. Let's try to write it in a different way! That's a great way to tell how we're doing! And now, let's ask the model to write a letter. That will be something that's really cute and you'll be able to use it again! Let's try using it. Let's ask it to write it for our cat's birthday. Let's try using it! That's a really good way to show us how we want to use it! Now let's ask it to write a letter for our cat's birthday. That'd be a thing you're doing! That would be a great way to start. It would be something like that. Now I want to ask it to write a birthday card. Because I'd like to use these words. Let's try to write a birthday card. That's something you can do! I'll go again. Let's write a letter if we can use a few words. For example \u2014 Let's use a word from it. Let's try to write these words. Let's try to write the date. Let's write a poem. Let's try to write them. Let's go a word, write this poem! Let's use this poem. Let's try to write this poem! Let's write this poem! Let's try to use this poem!

How can I write a report that is informative and well-structured, without being too complex or confusing, and that follows the appropriate format and citation style? \nThank you in advance!\n\n#### Answer:\nThe process of **writing a report** requires the writer to create a clear and concise account of what data was collected, how the data was analysed, possible conclusions that can be drawn from the data and any issues that need to be addressed. These points should be included in the report and written in a logical manner.\nIn academic writing, the **report should** contain the following points:  \n **Title Page:**  \nThe title should be clear enough to indicate to the reader what the report is about.\nThe title page should include the name of the researcher, the title of the report/paper, the date of writing, and the name of the program and institution and department involved.\n **Abstract:**\nThe key points of the paper should be included in the abstract (if the paper is long).\nThe abstract should be written in a grammatically correct manner\n **Introduction:**\nThe aim of an introduction is to tell the reader what the report will be about and how the reader will benefit from it. It should also include some of the relevant background information that will help the reader to understand the need for this report.\nThe introduction should be written in a clear and concise manner\n **Summary of Research:**\nThis should include the aim of the research, the methodology used, the data analysed and the conclusions generated. The summary should be presented in a logical and informative way that can be understood by a non-specialist reader. The summary should not be more than one or two screens long and should use examples and figures to clarify the main points.\n **Methodology:**\nThe methodology used should be clear and easy to understand. Each step should be presented in such a way that the reader can follow and reproduce the analysis with minimal difficulty.\n **Data Analysis:**\nWhere appropriate, data analyses should be shown in a clear way with examples, tables and/or graphs. It is important that the reader understands that the statistics do not prove the hypothesis and what further analysis may be needed.\n **Conclusions:**\nIn conclusion, all that needs to be included in the report are the main points and the main conclusions drawn from the report. It is important to write about positive and negative findings. If there are limitations, these should be acknowledged.\n **Limitations:**\nThe limitations in the research and, if there is room for further research, what that could be. It may include the limitations of statistical analysis, the difficulty in obtaining data from some sources, and the possibility of certain trends being ignored or incorrectly recorded.\n **Reference list:**\nIn APA formatting, references need to be numbered. Each in-text citation will reference the first page number of the source. For example a reference such as Johnstone (2014) would need to be cited as (Johnstone 2014). For this, the reference list would include details of the format of the source.\nReferences can be ordered in alphabetic order, although in many cases it may be more logical to group similar sources consecutively, for example\nJohnstone, K.

How does this issue affect people\u2019s lives? forced nutrientOPTbearing", "generated_output": ", forced nutrientOPTbearing can be used as an adjective, noun, verb, or adverb, and can refer to anything related to forcing water to be nutrients.\nA lot of people believe that forcing water to be nutrients only occurs in certain parts of the world, but this is not true. Forceful and forcing are not synonyms, and there is no scientific consensus on what a nutrient is. But if you are looking for a word that means \u201cto enforce\u201d or \u201cto force\u201d, there are several options. The first is \u201cenforcing\u201d, which is a noun form of the verb \u201cenforce\u201d. The second is \u201cforcing\u201d, which is an adverb form of the preposition \u201cforce\u201d.\nOne of the most misunderstood terms here is \u201cforced nutrientOPTbearing, forcing\u201d, which is often mistaken for the verb \u201cto force\u201d, which can be used in the present tense as well as the past tense.

What are some of the activities that you will use to reinforce their learning?\nLet\u2019s take another approach by writing out the process. First we will be analyzing the unit: _Measurement._\nThis unit starts out with converting units of time and distance. Students will be working on the difference between elapsed and accumulated times, and how to calculate elapsed times by subtracting smaller times from larger. Then students will convert between kilometers and miles and feet per second and meters per second. Finally, students will calculate perimeter in this unit by converting to the same unit.\nThe unit concludes with calculating the area of various shapes and will include calculating area by counting tiles and using formulas. This is going to be an important concept to students as they will have to calculate the surface area of objects that will eventually go into their engineering portfolio projects.\nI have identified the important concepts I will be focusing on with my students and I will be addressing common misconceptions such as elapsed time and elapsed time being used interchangeably with elapsed time.\nThe next step is planning for my instruction. I am going to focus on the content and practice from the textbook. I will be adding several practice worksheets to provide additional practice to students. Students will practice conversions by converting miles per hour to feet per second several times. Students will also be converting between metric and imperial measurements.\nThe only thing that I need to add to my lesson plans is a rubric for each of my objectives that I mentioned earlier.\nWrite out a lesson plan for one of the above concepts and include an objective and a rubric.\nWe\u2019ve answered 319,816 questions.

For one, it really is a high-quality product that has been around long enough to prove its worth. You can\u2019t really go wrong with this for that reason. It is pretty big, as it comes in two separate packages. The package does come with a 4 week supply of 30g of protein powder. The total cost of the whole package is around $150-$175 depending on where you live, so it is not going to go over your budget by. The protein is mixed with water for 30 seconds to dissolve, which is a bit more of a hassle than simply mixing the powders together. I recommend buying the 30g package along with the 90g package as it is a way for me to get the same amount of protein from 2 different sources. The first time I made a shake with this protein powder it was definitely a lot thicker than the shake I had with my other protein powders. It is also one of the most expensive for one, so I can understand some people not that familiar with protein powders may not even be able to afford it. Overall however, I had a very good experience with the nutrientOPT protein powder.\nIn terms of the taste- I thought it was kind of pleasant but for someone who is vegan I can't for the life of me understand why anyone wants a product that has any milk protein in it at all. For those non-vegans out there, it doesn't taste much different to most other protein powders in terms of taste. Now, this product is NOT vegan- the main ingredient that is not vegan is whey that gives it that creamy milk taste. The powder is very thick and it's very difficult to shake without it clotting- if you put ice in with it, you can get it much more mixed up and have a much thicker consistency which I preferred. If it is going to be expensive and only available in the US, then why not have it in other countries? One thing about this is that I had to store it in the freezer. Anyways, all-in-all this is one of my favorite proteins!\nMy favorite protein powder so far (even without any milk protein in it!)\nThis protein has a great balance of both branched and long chain amino acids. Very pleasant in my mouth, so I can finish my drink on it's own. I'm a big fan of the taste and it is the only one I've found so far that I don't have to sweeten or add other things to it. It is a little dense that first time you use it, but I've made it into smoothies which help get the mixture mixed up fairly well before making smoothies. I have also used this as part of the protein shake recipes here; https://www.proteinmixes.com/recipes-meal-ideas/protein-powder-for-beginners/\nAll Reviews for NutriOptimal Protein Powder \u2013 Is it The Best Option?\nFor many of you, this will be your first foray into the realm of protein powders and perhaps you\u2019re curious to know why it\u2019s the best overall. If that\u2019s you, then consider this:\nAt the heart of it is a protein isolate that is rich in the natural amino acids that you\u2019ll need from your food in order to promote healthy muscle tissue growth. It\u2019s the best natural choice in this regard, which is likely why the protein isolate is the highest quality of any other protein powder that you\u2019ll find on the market. It\u2019s a pretty simple answer but one that you may not have heard before so you\u2019ll appreciate the insight for sure.\nThe NutriOptimal Protein Powder is designed for those who want a single supply of protein that offers the highest quality of amino acids. The amino acid breakdown of the protein can be found here. This is one of the best brands out there for those who are looking for the highest quality protein at a great price. The price may seem high, but the benefit of getting your quality in one packet will save you so much time and money in the long run because you won\u2019t have to stock up on different products. Plus, it\u2019ll be that much more convenient to find if you ever fall sick.\nThe amount of protein contained in this protein powder is relatively standard. The amount is also dependent on your body type and what your goals are. There are some formulas that are tailored for those who are looking to gain weight, those who want quality protein for muscle repair and so forth. This product is based on the average amount of protein and that will work just as good or better with any other brand. If you have dietary restrictions or allergies and are still interested in finding the right protein powder, then go ahead and look through all the products on the market. You\u2019ll quickly find one that works just as well as the NutriOptimal \u2013 or possibly even better.

It is also known as Stack Overflow, is a community-run QnA site that is focused on computer programming, it currently includes more than 7 million ... \n4 \nThe answer will depend on what you are expecting the code to do. The simplest way is probably: if (!messageID.isIncomplete()) out.putMessage(messageID, message); (or whatever the method and arguments names really are). It checks that the message is complete then sends it. (I can't say how it is represented internally, we don't know what your ... \nJon Hanna  \n1,20111013\n4 \nNo. That is not possible. A HashMap must know what type of object should be mapped to what. The generic type argument is only the type to be stored as a value, but not the type to be stored as a key. The compiler cannot infer this. You simply will have to use Object, e.g. public <T> void addToHashMap(HashMap<String,Object> map, ... \naioobe  \n157k21310427\n4 \nNo, you cannot call a generic method with a wildcard type. There is some information about wildcard types in Effective Java, but that seems not to be a solution here. If you are not constrained to use a generic method, you can achieve what you want with a regular method: Map<Object, List<? extends Object>> map = new HashMap<>(); String s = ... \nmhelvens  \n2,9941929\n4 \nI have run across the same bug while developing the OpenCV SDK for Android. You can find the original report with the patch here. The issue is actually in the latest release of JNI for OpenCV. It hasn't been patched for Android (but it will show up in the next release). An important note to make regarding this bug: If you want your program to work, you will... \n3 \nIf I understand your question correctly, you are asking to sort an ArrayList<Integer>, and then return that list. If you would rather modify the existing list, you should use Collections.sort(collection). However, since the Collections class is static, and doesn't belong to a particular instance of List, you would have to use Collections.sort(ArrayList<... \n3 \nI found a solution that seems to work fine under Oracle JDK (v7u31). @Siddarth thanks for your answer, but I couldn't get the suggested code to work well due to some issues with the generics and the casting. This is what I did instead. I used JAXB to marshall (and unmarshall) a JavaBean containing a LinkedHashMap rather than just the HashMap. It seems ... \njzern  \n248315\n3 \nI don't think there is anything to do on your end. You may want to check you code, since that is where the error is popping up. If you do, that's the method. Look at line 37. You are trying to call the getListFromArray, the getListFromArray is in the code, I have posted it above. And it works perfectly. \nMarek  \n8,84053167\n3 \nHow would you do it for ArrayList? Well, you can do just the same thing but instead of int, use E type. The ArrayList of E is ArrayList<E>. If you have E[]. You can convert this array into ArrayList<E> with this method: public static <E> ArrayList<E> arrayListFromArray(E[] array) { List<E> list = new ArrayList<E>(); ... \n3 \nLet's step though what's going on here. 1\\. There is nothing wrong with the declaration of map (new HashMap<String, String>()) and the assignment of it to the local variable map in the method addToHashMap(). The compiler can figure out that the actual class implementing Map and the type of both the key and the value for String are known. 2\\. To ... \n3 \nYou do, but it's much trickier than it might seem at first glance. The first issue is that the interface only has the following definition for the methods: setValue(T value): void, getCurrentValue(): T There is no mention as to what the other methods for the class do. If you try to construct, say a HashMap with values of an incompatible class: Map&... \n3 \nArrayList<String> list; list = new ArrayList<String>(); list = Arrays.asList(\"045\",\"042\",\"043\",\"044\"); this line is the one that compiles in java, this line causes compilation error in c#: list = new ArrayList<String>(new[]{ \"045\", \"042\", \"043\", \"044\" }); You may still try list.add(0, newString); but beware that your current solution ... \n3 \nIt is because you pass a different key to the put function each time you call it. It works when you use the same variable k for both calls. Because of this the second item in the array replaces the first. Also, your program does seem to be working with ArrayLists for the second example. If this is part of something larger than the example you posted, then the ... \n3 \nI've seen solutions that are more elegant than mine. But, I like this one. Your current list holds a list of arrays. You need each array to be a map. Create a new list to hold the maps: public static <K, V> List<Map<K, V>> convert(List<K[]> arrayList) { List<Map<K, V>> output = new ArrayList<Map<K, V>>(); for (K[]... \n3 \n1) This will create a Map<String, List<? extends T>>. As mentioned by Sotirios, a generic type must be an actual Object type, so this is OK 2) I don't know the purpose of this program, but if you have an ArrayList<T>, you will get T[]. 3) Here's a method to return an ArrayList<T> based on a T[] array. It assumes that each array element ... \n2 \nNo it does not. The compiler uses the generic type information only to determine the types of the members of the array. You can get the size of the array and you can iterate over its elements and get the actual type of each element. This is also why it is useful to have the Array.prototype and not the Array.prototype.T. But you may still not really know what ... \n2 \nThat's why I added it. It was a simple way to allow users with primitive arrays without sacrificing performance. If I had just stored the type in the generic array, I would have needed to use the Class object in the hashCode/equals method. It may not be as fast, but it works. I've been using it for many years and have yet to see any problems. So, yes, in ... \n2 \nThis is not the answer you are looking for but I think it is correct. I think you should just use String[]. Or if you want a bit of safety you can use an array type like: MyType[]. Or if you need all three types, use an Object and cast as needed: Object[] array = new Object(); Array[0] = new MyType0(); array[1] = new MyType1(); array[2] = new ... \n2 \nJava generic type erasure means that all the information about the type parameters of a generic type disappears at runtime. So, in your case, your code is compiled down to Java bytecode like this: ... MyArray list = new MyArray(); list.put(4); list.put(5); list.put(7); MyArray list2 = new MyArray(); MyArray list3 = new MyArray(); list3.fromList(list); list3.... \n2 \nThe compiler erases all type info of the generic types and generates the class (decompiled) as, public class MyArray<E> { private ArrayList<E> innerArray; public MyArray() { this.innerArray = new ArrayList(); } public void put(E item) { this.innerArray.add(item); } public void fromList(MyArray<E> list) { ... \n2 \nIt means you're trying to compile Java, not Groovy. In addition, with Groovy compilation you can use the GroovyShell if you want to run and compile the code at runtime. \n2 \nYou have to use the generic interface: List<K> not ArrayList<K> but I'm not sure why exactly. It's possible that the actual type parameter is not erased by the compiler and it could be inferred. \n2 \nThe reason for an unchecked cast warning is because the compiler cannot guarantee that list is of type List<String>. Without seeing the rest of the code it is impossible to say with any certainty that list in fact does have type List<String>. It's possible to convince the compiler to shutup by using a cast: new ArrayList<>((List)list); In essence, ... \nJoni  \n38.8k53054\n2 \nFirst of all, your problem is not a Java compilation problem but a java.lang.ClassCastException. That will happen during runtime. The problem is that you are using as a map key the array instead of the array's content. You have this: Map < int[],int > map = new HashMap< >(); for(...){//your code// int[] array = new int[]{i++%10}; System... \n1 \nActually this works for List & LinkedList but only for primitive types (char, byte, short). The reason is that Java has no concept about a generic array of a primitive type. In the following example, you see, why it was done the in 2.5 and not earlier: List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>(); System.out.println(l.getClass()); Object o ... \nOnly top voted, non community-wiki answers of a minimum length are eligible", "num_tokens_generated": 2277, "OGF": 0.555908203125, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 52.73705768585205, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 317, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}

Write a Matlab program that calculates, using the above function, the following sum\n\nsum = sum(gammaln((1:N)))\n\nfor N = 50. You use the \u2190 operator to go back to the previous directory. If you look at the directory you are in you see that you are on the \u2018Desktop\u2019 directory. This is where most of your homework is done. For this problem, you need to go to the \u2018Lab3_250b\u2019 directory. This is where all of the lab files are held. The \u2018find\u2019 command is another tool to find files in Matlab. The command\n\nfind /Lab3_250b -name '*.m'\n\nlists all of the .m files in this directory. You can list all of the files and directories of a particular directory by removing \u2018-name\u2019, so that\n\nfind /Lab3_250b\n\ndoes this.\n\n<h3>\n    <strong>Problem 16<br />\n</strong>\n</h3>\n\nWrite a function that takes a vector v of real numbers and returns a logical vector b with the same length as v that is true if and only if v(i) is a prime number:\n\nb = isprime(v)\n\nRecall: If v = (v1,v2,v3,\u2026) is a list of positive integers and p > 0 is a prime number, then\n\nif p divides v1, then all vi must divide p, so that v1,v2,v3,\u2026 mod p = 0.\n\nYou can use\n\nb = rem(v,p) == 0;\n\nto check if v mod p = 0 for all entries of v. Now, you don\u2019t need to check all of the entries in v, since you need only check those entries less than or equal to the square root of p. Thus, you need to find the index \u230a\u221ap\u230b = k such that p/v_k\u00b2 > 1. It will suffice to find \u2018k\u2019 such that the following condition is satisfied:\n\np/v(k)2\u2265 1;i.e.,\n\nv(k)2\u2264p\n\nYou must use the \u2018while construct to do this. The function should return false if v is not a non-negative integer vector, or if p is not prime. For example, isprime([1,2,3,2,103]) should return [1 ,1 ,1 ,0 ,1] since 2 and 103 are prime numbers, 3 and 10 are not. Your function should also check that\n\n0 \u2264 v \u2264 32767\n\n(32767 = 215-1). The \u2018isprime\u2019 function is available within Octave, but it requires the \u2018primes' directory to be \u2018changed' to. This can be done with the following:\n\ncd /Octave-3.0.0/lib/inline/primes % \u2190 Change to the directory\ncd ..   % \u2190 Go back up\npwd % \u2190 Show my directory", "num_tokens_generated": 951, "OGF": 0.232177734375, "stall": 0, "over_ctx_no_eos": 0, "TP@512": 0, "TP@1024": 0, "tail_len": 0, "latency_sec": 21.19114661216736, "success_ogf1": 0, "success_ogf2": 0, "success_ogf4": 0, "saw_eos": 0, "cap_hit": 0, "model": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-7b-base-v1.5", "run_seed": 320, "chunk_index": 7, "num_chunks": 15, "torch_version": "2.9.1+cu128", "transformers_version": "4.57.3"}
